opinionwire email newsletter social engineering instead of using technical skills to break into computers hackers often use the weakness of the human mind to gain access to corporations hackers befriend users and trick them into giving away sensitive information that can be used to gain access to systems these hackers also use trickery such as pretending to be from tech support to get unsuspecting users to give up their username and password information serbian hackers used the technique to gain access to web sites registered by network solutions inc according to the butler group the hackers then defaced these sites as a form of political and social protest while no data was stolen the incidents bring up an interesting point while you may have security in place it is still important to educate users on security practices such as never giving passwords or other sensitive information out to unknown people or web sites aol warns its users all the time that administrators

just send it along with this one i love you madly and dearly youre the only one whos managed to say anything of worth about this whole incidence amber and molly stared at me blankly and said something like dont be so overly dramatic and then rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to hang out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend and blah blah blah it was really disappointing that they didnt understand the importance of never being rational when it comes to men it was so not fun but i was really proud of myself because i left work fuming on the verge of tears and by the time i got home i was smiling and joking with amber and molly about how schnockered they had been the night before then molly and i took a big long walk and got awesome thai food brought it home and watched the thursday night lineup all in all it was a very successful evening without runner man whose name by the way is dave take one point off for that and guess what he ended up calling at about eight three zero molly was on the other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a message so awhile later when i got a call from jill daves friends girlfriend who im also friends with this all gets very complicated i was very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with us i just assumed she was with her boyfriend and dave and made up some sweet excuse about how i had just eaten and was too full to move because i was like no way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up no way so that was thator so i thought at about one zero pm runner man himself calls and basically admits that hes psycho for cancelling our date and then calling me all night long ya think anyway he tells me he was in this enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride and didnt want me to see him in such a bad state i still thought it was a lame excuse and that once youd reached the ripe age of three one you should be smart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone so i told him that and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and my roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn which he had started the other night when he was over to make it up to me i told him if he did that he might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is where he is now thats finance lingo anyway the plan is hes going to come over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like two zero people who we somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight although i dont remember doing that anna you have to stay with me one night when youre home in june because its a constant riot i wont go into some of the things amber did the other night right now but ill tell you soon so you can swap stories when you see her by the way she snagged an armload of my clothes actually most of which were yours to wear at fancy dinners in denver so if you see anything you want back just let her know i think its just that red laundry shirt and the really short black bcbg skirt hey guess what i have to go ill call you tonight take care kate anna symes annascobsedu on zero three two three two zero zero one zero eight zero six one eight am to katesymesenroncom katesymesenroncom cc subject re that sucks kate i bet that isnt the last well be seeing of mr running man though first of all who gets scared off by drunk roommates if anything it should be a relief to him that he doesnt need to impress any of your clan second it sounds like the classic insecure blowoff to me if you think back youll probably remember a couple of instances in which your demeanorcommentsfacial expression may have sent him the message that he is the stupidest thing on gods green earth i know this because i have the same habit so he probably went home mulled over those few devastating instances and came to the conclusion that youre not that into it and being a man only men and symess do this he cancelled on you before you had the chance to crush his ego once again am i right i think so tentatively planning on going out with amber and monica on saturday night im mad that im hanging out with your roommate before i get to hang out with you monica and i are thinking of splitting your ticket since we know youll never save the money like i should talk you have to come out here though its about six seven degrees right now and its nine zero zero in the morning on a day in march i cant believe how happy this sun makes me you would love it too okay feel better and dont sweat the stupid running guy if he thinks hes not worthy of you chances are hes not a stiff margarita will make this whole problem a lot more manageable dont you think you should go have one love you luego anna original message from katesymesenroncom mailtokatesymesenroncom sent thursday march two two two zero zero one five two six pm to annascobsedu subject re well to tell you the truth it sucks right now work has been snowballing with all kinds of unimaginable computer problems so many that ive basically forgotten what they all are now and on top of that runner guy stopped by last night and it happened to be the last day of ambers finals so she and molly had been drinking since two pm well im not quite sure if that scared him away but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight he asked me i accepted we had a time picked out now i never make plans as a rule but this was a goddamn plan so he calls one five minutes ago and actually cancels not even just that he doesnt give a reason i am so livid right now theres smoke coming out of my ears i need to go finish work so i can get out of here and go bomb his car ill call you tonight kate anna symes annascobsedu on zero three two two two zero zero one zero four zero three three three pm to kate symes email katesymesenroncom cc subject hey poopstain whats up i am sooooo good dad and my car will be here on monday isnt that great i just want to drive for the rest of my life so i get three days off next week plus im leaving for my outward bound course next friday so basically i have like a week vacation things are still going with the cute waiter nathan but ive discovered a flaw it was only a matter of time you know actually its a nonfatal flaw its annoying at worst basically he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers and talks on it in all types of situations such as the video store a taxi cab and while eating dinner with his friends i just cant stand those things its one thing to chat on it when youre walking down the street by yourself or in your car by yourself but when youre with other people or in the checkout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you i just think its so rude but im going to try to get over it because otherwise hes great and i seem to be the only person on gods green earth who has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze so thats my life whats going on in yours love anna,09:09:00

assignments and testimony c onfidential i have scheduled a conference call for tuesday may nine from three zero zero pmfive zero zero pm to discuss our rebuttal testimony on the comprehensive settlement agreement that is due on friday may one nine i know many of you are still recovering from the direct testimony which looks fabulous compelling and persuasive but we now need to focus our attention on rebuttal call in number is one eight zero zero seven two zero five eight four six confirmation number is six one eight five eight five four im looking for feedback on the best approach to rebuttal and i have a few suggestions first i would like to limit the testimony to witnesses who have already filed direct testimony unless we absolutely need to add additional witnesses my preference is to stop while we are ahead adding more witnesses will make it increasingly difficult to convince the alj that the panel approach will work second although this is rebuttal testimony it is not typical rebuttal alj biren reserved this rebuttal for parties opposing settlements to state their case in as much as we can work in issues that are objectionable from direct we should do so nonetheless we should try and focus our testimony on those things in the postinterim that are objectionable and inconsistent with the commissions most promising options i would use all of our powder on the postinterim arguments and limit our opinions on the viability of the interim at least some of the interim signatories will take this approach we will also need to address issues raised by pge long beach and others but it should not take up a lot of ink i would like to portion out the assignments to the postinterim as follows socalgas historical reply to reasonability of capacity contracts assignments and stepdowns socalgas shareholder riskreward consistency with the global settlement ratepayer sharing socalgas montebello socalgas information disclosure ora gas accord as the appropriate

nine eight eight the california energy commission believed the state would need five four zero zero zero megawatts of power by two zero zero zero partly to accommodate robust economic growth but this year california actually required five six zero zero zero megawatts that difference is enough to power about two million homes theres no getting around it mills said cyberspace far from virtual is very real and anchored in electrons depending on whom you believe high technology consumes from three percent to two zero percent of the nations total power generation and some expect that number to rise to as high as four zero percent by two zero one zero whether that number is five one zero three zero or four zero percent is open to question says jim owen spokesman of the edison electric institute the added demand from the eworld couldnt come at a worse time california is now caught in a serious electricity shortfall for various reasons an unexpectedly hot summer aging power plants that are prone to break down years of poor investment in new plants and the new efforts at deregulation in the state imbalance since one nine nine five for the past five years the supply of electricity statewide has grown much more slowly than the demand for it from companies and residents supply and demand were in balance until about one nine nine five since then supply has grown only one percent while demand has expanded by one one five percent according to the california energy commission for the bay area state officials say there exists a shortfall of around nine zero zero megawatts or enough electricity to power about nine zero zero zero zero zero homes you guys in california are the biggest energy hogs around says michael economides professor of chemical engineering who has studied power consumption take a house with three teenagers you have six phone lines recharged cellulars car phones and computers san jose for example sucks up about two five three five megawatts from outside the city and produces only one six five for itself according to stephanie mccorkle spokeswoman at the states independent system operator which controls the purchasing of much of californias power to make up the difference the city needs to draw on outside sources that are limited themselves since they come from other areas that are also growing quickly blackout warnings with the state running beyond capacity local power officials are warning of blackouts in the summer when a rolling blackout hit silicon valley on june one four several companies were alarmed they stepped up talks within a task force of the silicon valley manufacturing group about ways to conserve energy use and to minimize the burden on the local power grid sun microsystems inc has estimated that a blackout costs up to one million per minute according to larry owens division manager of customer services for silicon valley power the utility that manages power for many large companies in santa clara county chuck mulloy spokesman for intel corp said that if one of its fabrication plants shuts down it could cost millions depending on the circumstances nevertheless many computer companies are reluctant to talk about their power needs saying that it will alert competitors about their cost structures some say theyre confident the bay area shortfall can be patched up over the next couple of years through a variety of measures including building local power plants and transmission stations local generation is important experts say because it prevents voltage instability which can seriously harm hightech computer servers that require high reliability for some of their most precise equipment internet economy companies need whats called five nine s or nine nine nine nine nine percent reliability to nine nine s or nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine percent reliability this in turn requires backup hardware backup generators backup batteries switches and software said mills the energy consultant the need for local power is one of the issues in the debate surrounding the proposed calpine plant for coyote valley which if approved would go online by two zero zero three cisco systems inc which is proposing to build a campus in the area has opposed the plant for health and safety reasons ciscos officials say that a patchwork of other plans already in place including building two power plants in pittsburg and others in san francisco contra costa and san mateo counties will eventually generate enough electricity to avoid building another plant in high demand meanwhile many of the new ebusinesses have a voracious appetite for electricity exodus communications inc intel and inktomi corp for example have erected massive webhosting and data centers that use about one zero times the amount of electricity per square foot of a typical commercial building for example a one zero zero zero zero zero squarefoot webhosting center built by exodus consumes enough electricity to power one zero zero zero zero zero homes estimated ed quiroz regulatory analyst at the public utilities commission in san francisco theyve completely caught projections off guard he says its a huge growth industry the limiting factor is going to be the reliability of electricity and theres no sign that the demand for power in silicon valley will slow any time soon mills said the amount of electricity consumed by watching a movie by videostreaming over the internet is two zero times more than that used to watch the same movie on television mobile phones he said use about three times the amount of electricity that normal phone lines do because they operate by bouncing signals off of base stations all of these will be on the rise he pointed out especially in silicon valley the buildup of the internet has just begun he says and in the valley theres a shadow of electricity growing behind it contact matt marshall at mmarshallsjmercurycom or four zero eight

 leverage with the generators/marketers at Wednesday's meeting",an excerpt from a recent article davis who told reporters monday that the state is at war with houstonbased generators is expected to meet with representatives from a dozen energy companies wednesday to discuss unpaid debts credit issues and the supply of power those generators include mirant williams and duke energy at the meeting wednesday davis will attempt to get the generators to take a haircut on hundreds of millions of dollars of power bills owed by pge corp unit pacific gas electric and edison international unit southern california edison in exchange a person close to davis said the governor may promise to veto the windfall profits tax bill if it reaches his desk generators warn of blackouts if calif oks windfall tax updated tuesday may eight two zero zero one zero seven one nine pm et by jason leopold of dow jones newswires los angeles dow joneslegislation to place a windfall profits tax on sales of electricity into california will deter investments in new generation and drive power out of the state raising the risk of blackouts wholesalemarket power suppliers said tuesday it would be totally counterproductive and prolong californias misery for years to come said gary ackerman executive director of the western power trading forum an industry group new plants in california wouldnt get built and existing plants would cease operating there would be blackouts all day long on monday the senate passed by a vote of two five one two a bill to tax at one zero zero sales of electricity into california above eight zero a megawatthour a separate windfall profits tax bill with a threetiered rate system is moving through the assemblys committees and could come up for a vote in the full house later this week electricity priced at six zero mwh would be taxed at five zero sales of power over nine zero mwh would be taxed at seven zero and electricity sales over one two zero mwh would be taxed at nine zero gov gray davis has said he is open to the concept of windfall profits tax on electricity sold into california but hasnt said whether he supports the bills moving through the legislature generators said they would seriously consider scrapping plans to build muchneeded new generation in california if the measure is signed into law we do have some concerns on how the bill would affect new generation said mirant corp spokesman chuck griffin whose company is investing about five zero zero million in new power plants in northern california we have said all along that before we are able to build this generation we need to make a good assessment of the business environment in the state and the windfall profits tax is certainly a factor tim thuston managing director of government relations for williams cos said a windfall profits tax is confiscatory and the state is trying to circumvent the federal energy regulatory commission i can tell you we think its a very poor idea thuston said im speculating but i think any time a state starts seizing profits it would deter investment in that state duke energy a power supplier investing more than six zero zero million in new power plants in california wouldnt comment on how the tax would affect its plans mirant following williams lead supports shortterm regional price controls if they would bring stability to the states wholesale power market griffin said we have expressed that we may be comfortable with some form of temporary price mitigation in order to get through this crisis griffin said but the base prices for electricity written into the windfalltax bills are much lower than generators actual costs ackerman said todays gas prices are much higher than that he said everybody would automatically sell out of state lawmakers unmoved lawmakers arent overly concerned with negative implications if the measure becomes law if the price for rolling out the welcome for generators is one zero to three zero times more than californians paid for power last year then we ought to build our own plants said state sen debra bowen dredondo beach and chairwoman of the senate energy committee the states motto is eureka not welcome to california please come gouge us paul van dyke press secretary to state sen nell soto dontario who is sponsoring the windfall profits tax bill in the senate said theres no evidence that leaving things the way they are now will be better california has a limited policy chest and federal energy regulators are not moving fast enough to solve the problems van dyke said california needs to build up its tool chest so at the end of the day whether we solve this problem through windfall profits or a negotiated agreement with the generators the bottom line is consumers cannot be gouged davis who told reporters monday that the state is at war with houstonbased generators is expected to meet with representatives from a dozen energy companies wednesday to discuss unpaid debts credit issues and the supply of power those generators include mirant williams and duke energy at the meeting wednesday davis will attempt to get the generators to take a haircut on hundreds of millions of dollars of power bills owed by pge corp unit southern california edison in exchange a person close to davis said the governor may promise to veto the windfall profits tax bill if it reaches his desk the governors office wouldnt comment on the substance of the meeting wednesday wall street analysts said the measure could have severe effects on californias economy if it passes and will pressure generators shares as the bills move through the legislature we expect weakness in generators shares with california exposure dan ford an analyst with lehman brothers said in a research note tuesday a windfall profits tax bill will motivate generation developers to remove existing and new capital to other states and potentially destroy californias already softening economy ultimately however ford expects the bill to be used as a bargaining chip rather than passed the tax also raises regulatory questions several lawmakers said in essence california is attempting to set wholesale power rates which are governed by the federal energy regulatory commission a ferc commissioner wouldnt comment directly on the issue but told dow jones newswires that the state has no jurisdiction on wholesale power rates and does not have the legal authority to adjust rates set by ferc by jason leopold dow jones newswires three two three six five eight three eight seven four jasonleopolddowjonescom

id share it with you except for the clearing organization rules which appear to me to be a mess i think this should make life simpler for sara and jim in dealing with equity derivatives for mark taylor sara and others in dealing with principaltoprincipal negotiated commodity derivatives and perhaps for enrononline nora this will no doubt pose some interesting questions relative to dealbench and of course if and to the extent that enron wants to set up or otherwise get involved in multiple participant btwo b internet trading sites that involve transactions that will be completed online there will be some issues that need to be addressed this should be viewed as a very preliminary report because i have not had a chance to study the new rules carefully i will send more complete information later last week the commodities futures trading commission adopted its new regulatory framework a series of rules that i believe will greatly expand the breadth depth height weight and size of the cftcs bureaucracy and the scope of the cftcs regulatory involvement in all sorts of things including financial guarantees that it has not attempted to regulate heretofore the cftc described this rule making as a regulatory reinvention indeed the cftc has reinvented itself without congressional authorization to do so in particular under the new rules for the first time the cftcs board of trade regulation is not confined to markets in which speculators participate in effect it has extended its board of trade regulatory reach into a portion of the overthecounter market that involves only business participants probably the biggest headache for all of us will be the new rules relating to clearing organizations defined as a person who provides credit enhancement functions with respect to certain transactions including transactions that rely on the new bilateral contract exemption discussed below in many cases it will be illegal for a company that does not register with and become regulated by the cftc as a recognized clearing organization rco to provide credit enhancement functions i obviously need to study the rules further but my initial read is that the rules are a disaster in drafting for example i dont think that the cftc intended to say that a parent company cannot guarantee a swap entered into by its subsidiary unless the parent company registers as an rco but on my initial reading it appears to me that the rule is not at all clear and could be read that way so if you are working on any transaction that involves a guarantee of a swap or other transaction that is exempt under the new exemption for bilateral contracts you need to run this issue to ground before you close the rules dont become effective however until six zero days after they are published in the federal register there are some good things about the new rules the new exemption for bilateral contracts greatly liberalizes the swaps exemption and expands it so that it covers contracts other than swaps it provides greater certainty regarding the enforceability of derivatives and in most cases of contracts for physical delivery of commodities the bilateral contracts exemption however is unavailable for contracts entered into through multiple transaction execution facilities or mtefs multiple participant btwo b internet trading sites will be classified as mtefs unless participants are required to go offline to complete the contracts as for example chematch requires its participants to do under the new rules multiple participant btwo b internet trading sites that involve swaps and other derivative contracts completed online must submit themselves to cftc regulation as derivatives transaction facilities or dtfs moreover an mtef that trades only in physical delivery contracts can achieve contract enforcement certainty of the type offered by the exemption for bilateral contracts only if it submits itself to regulation as a dtf the mtef definition excludes any internet trading site such as enrononline that involves a single party offering to enter into trades with multiple parties and therefore the sponsor of such a site can take advantage of the exemption for bilateral contracts without submitting itself to cftc regulation dtfs must not permit any person other than an eligible commercial participant to trade the term eligible commercial participant is defined in the rule and includes generally commercial counterparties and financial intermediaries although the cftc promises that its regulation of dtfs will be more light handed that that historically applied to us futures exchanges the new regulatory framework is likely to result in significant regulatory oversight of multiple participant btwo b internet trading sites that register as dtfs under the new rules each sponsor must determine whether to restrict trading on its site to avoid cftc regulation or to submit to regulation robert s baird vinson elkins llp one

trading online results of legal due diligence and risk me mo note given the proposed launch date of two four january two zero zero zero for this product two zero this note is intended to serve both as a summary of the results of our lega ltwo zero due diligence and as a risk memo as you know we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries two zero where it was intended the credit product would initially be traded viatwo zero enrononline namely the uk the us canada finland germany norwaytwo zero sweden and switzerland under the terms of the credit product on thetwo zero occurrence of a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party thetwo zero reference entity the seller of the product which could be either enron or two zero its online counterparty will pay a fixed preagreed cash sum in an agreed two zero currency to the buyer it should be borne in mind that this product differ stwo zero in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in two zero the international markets this means that a change in the nature or terms oftwo zero our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely two zero change the analysis below set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the moretwo zero significant legal issues i am also attaching a two page executive summar ytwo zero of legal advice prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significa nttwo zero legal issuesrisks in each country and which should be read in conjunction two zero with this note mail as you will see the executive summary does not focus ontwo zero issues we raised which are all clear from a legal perspective so as to two zero keep the summary to a sensible length but there was plenty of good news two zero too where a legal issue has been identified i have either set out belo wtwo zero what action is to be taken or not addressed it further on the basis that ontwo zero the advice of foreign counsel the risk is not very substantial or unlikely two zero to materialise therefore where no comment is made below in relation to a two zero risk highlighted in the attached summary please assume that the legal risk two zero is one which in our view it is reasonable to take a countries in which the credit product can be traded in january two zero zero zero finland norway sweden switzerland uk us b countries in which launch of the product via enrononline will need to b etwo zero delayed canada germany reasons set out below c general issues applicable in all countries the credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy andtwo zero related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks two zero of a general nature i capacity we will not be able to assume generally that ourtwo zero counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade t hetwo zero product and so will need to check each counterpartys constitutionaltwo zero documents before allowing them to trade the product online this applies t otwo zero almost all entities eg corporates municipalities insurance companies in two zero all countries some entities may lack the power to trade under the general two zero law in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all or under two zero their constitutional documents in which case they will need to amend their two zero constitutional documents if they wish to trade two zero the check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit tradingtwo zero relationship and so can be added to our procedures it is not a particular lytwo zero onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally ii confidentiality we will need to put in place procedures to ensure two zero that we are not misusing confidential information about our businesstwo zero counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection misuse can occur two zero both in pricing the product and trading it the procedures will not includ etwo zero formal chinese walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o rtwo zero the credit department a point we have managed to agree with both uk and us two zero counsel following very detailed discussions the procedures will include two zero a the use of a restricted list in both the us and europe similar to the two zero procedure currently used in houston and b practical steps to ensure tha ttwo zero confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which two zero we are not entitled to use eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali tytwo zero agreement is not imparted to the credit traders in addition where enron two zero has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity o rtwo zero otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity we will two zero need its written consent before offering protection on that entity withou ttwo zero such consent there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha ttwo zero entity for breach of confidence d country specific issues i canada there is a substantial risk that the product will constitute two zero insurance business constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the two zero product unenforceable against our counterparties we should try to resolve two zero this issue with the canadian authorities before launching the product intwo zero canada timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear two zero which canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter ii germany again the issue is insurance the risk is higher than in two zero canada and so germany should be excluded initially iii norway there is a material risk that the credit product could be two zero regarded as gaming in norway in which case trades would be void andtwo zero unenforceable the normal way to mitigate this risk in norway is by using atwo zero substantial professional effort to satisfy ourselves that a trade is bein gtwo zero entered into for valid commercial purposes normally hedging by ourtwo zero counterparty clearly it will not be possible to take such steps on a trad etwo zero by trade basis in the context of enrononline at a minimum we shouldtwo zero therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this two zero product with each norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic two zero behind its trading this product type iv switzerland if the credit product is the main purpose of our tradi ngtwo zero relationship with a counterparty we should check with the swiss supervisor ytwo zero authority whether the product constitutes insurance the position beingtwo zero unclear if a trade is insurance it can be terminated by the counterpart ytwo zero which is obviously of greater concern if enron is the buyer and an offenc etwo zero will be committed since enron is not authorised as a swiss insurer howeve rtwo zero i understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existingtwo zero business relationships in which case we can parallel path this issue v us new york lawtwo zero a cftc regulation by structuring the product either as a swap or antwo zero option and meeting certain other conditions we can rely on exemptions und ertwo zero the us commodities exchange acttwo zero b us securities laws there is a small chance that the credit product two zero constitutes a security under us securities laws please see attachedtwo zero executive summary however sec regulations allow the public offering of two zero securities to accredited investors which will allow us to deal withtwo zero investors having at least usfive million in assets since most of ourtwo zero counterparties will be fairly large sophisticated players this test shoul dtwo zero not impede the business c insider trading us counsel have advised that the risk of insidertwo zero trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as securit ytwo zero

one associated press newswires copyright two zero zero one the associated press all rights reserved washington ap senior white house adviser karl rove increasingly a target of criticism from democrats and republicans wound up at the center of a new storm over his dealings with the salvation army white house aides rallied to his side and rove was unapologetic but democratic national committee chairman terry mcauliffe called for congressional hearings i think the truth needs to come out mcauliffe said thursday lets have hearings and get to the bottom of this at issue was the salvation armys push for a regulation allowing religious charities to practice workplace discrimination against gays and roves actions on behalf of the group rove said he was simply doing his job while mcauliffe called for hearings senate majority leader tom daschle dsd seemed less riled karl rove is a very respected individual and i wouldnt have any comment to make daschle said thursdays flap was not the first for rove who oversees politics strategy and public liaison at the white house when sen james jeffords bolted the gop and turned the senate over to democrats last month republicans accused rove of alienating the vermont lawmaker during the taxcut debate he was fingered too for not warning bush earlier that jeffords might jump ship when rove sat in white house meetings on policy that could impact his stock portfolio democrats demanded to know whether his holdings with houstonbased enron corp and intel corp created a conflict of interest when bush crossed some military advisers and suspended navy bombing on the puerto rican island of vieques roves involvement in the case was held up as proof by critics that the decision was politicallymotivated roves involvement in the salvation army case has stirred debate in republican and democratic circles about whether he wields too much power and is too political for the white house the white house rejected the salvation armys request wednesday but only after the revelation of an embarrassing salvation army memo the memo said the administration had promised to issue a regulation protecting it and other religious charities from efforts to prevent such discrimination in exchange for the salvation armys support of bushs plan to open government programs to religious groups white house officials left the impression that no senior officials were involved in the discussions failing to point out roves activity until thursday in a telephone interview rove said he recalled having just three or four brief discussions on the topic he received a request from a salvation army ally to looked into the rule sent the ally to the white house faithbased office forwarded the written request to a government lawyer and was told later by the lawyer were not certain theres anything we can do the lawyer jay lefkowitz told reporters the request lay dormant after his discussion with rove rove rejected the criticism my job is not to say dont send me something or call me my job is to keep my eyes and ears open and send things to the appropriate departments he said some top republicans outside the white house said rove has become a lightening rod part of his role is to be a deflection shield for the president said gop consultant rich bond everytime karl takes a hit its one less hit the president has to take karl knows that and he is a big boy aides say the president is not troubled by roves actions even joking about the controversies white house chief of staff andrew card also defended rove i may be naive but we have no problem of division on the senior level said card i was in the reagan white house when we had three clear camps we dont have that here aides do acknowledge however that there is some resentment of rove in the lower ranks of the white house some grumbled that rove did not let white house press secretary ari fleischer know wednesday about his involvement in the salvation army case

able to respond more quickly but we did the best we could said michael kahn chairman of the independent system operator the states electric grid manager he led the state delegation heart of dispute at

is no way you are going to get any kind of agreement from someone making such audacious claims said donato eassey an energy analyst at merrill lynch co in houston the refunds may be secondary to

nine zero of the respondents approved the governors suggestion to add new power generation plants within california and make existing plants more efficient the proposal as worded doesnt distinguish between adding new plants or making existing plants more efficient or some combination thereof critics note that in the past californians have been hesitant about power plants being built in their own

weekend on a plan to rescue californias troubled two largest utilities and keep power flowing to customers have brought participants no closer to a solution sources involved in the discussions said monday and as events tuesday are expected to push the states financially ailing electric utilities closer to bankruptcy responsibility for the potential meltdown rests squarely with california gov gray davis a key federal energy regulator said monday youve got a governor who cares more about being on a nighttime news show than he does about fixing the problem in california said curtis hebert a republican on the us federal energy regulatory commission hebert criticized davis a democrat for his refusal to swallow the bitter financial medicine needed to rescue the states flawed power market restructuring initiative heberts comments echo those voiced privately by industry officials and clinton administration officials involved in unprecedented discussions brokered by the white house since tuesday the talks are designed to reach agreement on a plan that will allow the states utilities to continue purchasing power for their retail customers despite a liquidity crunch brought about by the states power market restructuring effort broadly the proposed deal involves having californias department of water resources enter into longterm power sales contracts on behalf of the utilities this would end the utilities reliance on volatile spot markets for power purchases in return power generators are to grant some form of forbearance for the money they are owed while the forward contracts are ironed out but throughout seven days of negotiations davis has refused to consider raising stateprotected retail rates and has resisted calls for the state to issue credit guarantees for the utilities in the meantime davis has insisted that power suppliers agree to sell the state power under longterm contracts at rates generators say is below their cost of production unless davis backs down no rescue package can be struck some people close to the negotiations say everybodys still trying to talk but now its spinning out of control said a person involved in the discussions a person representing power marketers and familiar with the status of the talks i dont see any great cause for optimism particularly when i hear some of the things that daviss office says governors office rejects talk of no progress a spokesman for the governor rejected the characterization that the talks were stymied people are working and moving forward said steve maviglio the governors spokesman if they werent closer to an agreement they wouldnt still be talking to send a message to the markets that theres not progress here is irresponsible draft legislation to be unveiled tuesday at the state legislature will hold up the governors end of the deal maviglio said the legislation will give the state the authority to purchase power on behalf of the utilities and the structure of the longterm

successful unregulated business units should the utility unit files for bankruptcy developments could come fast and furious if financial markets open tuesday with no deal struck wall street credit ratings agencies have warned they will downgrade the utilities debt to speculative or junkbond status if a solution isnt reached soon and various entities are expected to file emergency petitions with the federal energy regulatory commission to ensure that power keeps flowing to the state despite the utilities inability to purchase power for their retail customers according to sources familiar with the discussions one filing would allow the department of water resources to purchase wholesale power on behalf of the utilities while another would give southern california edison more time to make

energy producers need a precondition a signal that were serious and heading in a direction theyre comfortable with said one lawmaker involved in the talks one idea proposed by gov gray davis and others is to have the state use its financial resources to purchase power from electricity producers for resale to the financially beleaguered utilities we dont have to go into business tomorrow as the purchaser the lawmaker said we simply have to make a strong enough and substantive enough statement coming out of the state capitol so that the creditors and energy producers will exercise forbearance such forbearance would give utilities more time to pay billions of dollars of wholesale power costs that they have accrued but havent been able to collect from customers through rates several people involved in yesterdays talks said they were optimistic that some plan would be ready to present to a legislative committee today for public hearings and potentially a vote in the assembly they acknowledged that as of late yesterday that no agreements had been reached with electricity producers on such crucial issues as the price to be charged for the electricity and the length of the supply contracts californias legislature has been called into special session by gov davis to consider a series of bills aimed both at improving the states electricity supply and at curtailing

edison doesnt pay its power exchange bill it could be a signal that the utility is moving closer to a bankruptcylaw filing richard cortright jr a standard poors director said an analysis by the creditratings concern indicates that edison has enough cash to pay the power exchange preserving cash by not paying bills is often a tactic a company uses before bankruptcy mr cortright said sp and other ratings concerns have been closely following the california electricity crisis because of the impact it could have on billions of dollars of utility bonds outstanding the ratings concerns have severely downgraded both edison and pge bonds the agencies generally havent dropped those bonds into junk bond status which is below investment grade such a downgrade would put the utilities into various financial defaults that could exacerbate their acute cash problems while the california situation is incredibly fluid any failure by edison to pay its power bills paints a very very dire picture mr cortright said to better understand the current picture state legislative leaders have recruited several legal and financial advisers among them is david wiggs managing director of lido

backed the need for the state to buy power but there has been no agreement on two key issues the price and the duration of the contracts the price needs to be low enough so that utilities with the

in talks among a halfdozen republican and democratic lawmakers also involved were the states finance director a bankruptcy lawyer and two utility experts from credit suisse first boston their purpose was to craft a skeleton of the legislation that california will need to implement davis proposal and have it passed by at least one house of the legislature today senate leader john burton dsan francisco has said that while the legislature works power generators should be willing to give utilities leeway on bills coming due but thats unlikely unless the legislature acts quickly said bergstrom of dynegy his company purchased three southern california power plants when edison pge and san diego gas electric auctioned off assets as part of deregulation dynegys plants can generate enough electricity to supply two eight million homes were just not going to do that bergstrom said because the stakes are too high he met with davis and california lawmakers in washington dc last tuesday evening and spoke to them again through a bicoastal video conference saturday the governor has been lobbying power plant owners to sign longterm contracts with the utilities at roughly five five cents per kilowatthourwell below the recent market rate of three zero cents power plant owners call that price unrealistic unless the contract lasts at least six or seven years allowing them to recoup money later when the cost of natural gas is expected to fall and make electricity cheaper to generate contract details do not matter bergstrom said so long as the utilities are so debtridden as to be unworthy of credit thats why the state needs to step in to buy power and guarantee payment he said but some lawmakers have downplayed the urgency burton has said it is more important to get the details of a bill right than to move quickly to insert the state as a gobetween in californias electricity market raises many complex financial and political issues even lawmakers who support helping the utilities insist that consumers get something in return stock options ownership of utility transmission lines or takeover of hydroelectric power plantsa cheap source of power that affects the environmental health of many sierra nevada riversare among the assets the state should consider burton said hertzberg spokesman paul hefner said lawmakers have included bankruptcy lawyers and financial experts not solely to impress wall street but also because they realize they are entering a realm they know little about he said politicians clearly want to send a message to financial markets that they are working with industry experts when considering the consequences of their legislation but he said their main goal is to get technical advice from someone who is not a bureaucrat

the battle over setting rates henry weinstein times legal affairs writer zero one one six two zero zero one los angeles times home edition aone five copyright two zero zero one the times mirror company a federal judges recent ruling that southern california edison co has the right to pass on to consumers its costs of acquiring power on the wholesale market does not mean that ratepayers will have to bear any of those costs soon but the decision nonetheless provided immediate benefits to the beleaguered utilityprimarily making the company look more financially secure and creditworthy because the ruling could pave the way for a recovery of more than two billion for edison consequently attorneys and spokesmen for edison trumpeted the ruling of us district judge ronald sw lew as a significant victory attorneys for the california public utilities commission played down the decisions consequences saying it was merely the first skirmish in a long process regardless of how significant lews ruling was the legal battle clearly has important ramifications and they go beyond edisons financial health ultimately the case titled southern california edison vs loretta m lynch president of the puc may determine whether edisons customers have to pay more for electricity moreover the caseand a virtually identical one filed by pacific gas electric co in oakland federal courtmay clarify whether there will be any change in the traditional demarcation of regulatory authority over utilities as a result of deregulation historically the federal government has regulated wholesale power rates and state governments have regulated retail rates those charged to consumers one of the key issues in the edison and pge cases is the utilities contention that a pucimposed rate freeze violated the traditional demarcation by indirectly interfering with federal regulatory authority both companies say that they have been prevented from recovering their wholesale purchase costs because of the rate freeze imposed by the puc as part of the massive utility deregulation law enacted in one nine nine six known as ab one eight nine zero unless the issues are resolved by legislative action on the state energy crisis it seems likely that the two suits will wind up in the us nine th circuit court of appeals and perhaps ultimately the us supreme court the california public utilities

march three one two zero zero two or until what are known as a utilitys stranded costs in essence certain assets such as nuclear power plants that were overvalued in one nine nine six are recovered the puc determined last year that san diego gas electric the states other major privately owned utility had recovered its stranded costs enabling that company to impose rate hikes but the agency has said that edison and pge are not entitled to take such action yet on jan eight judge lew agreed in principle with edisons contention that the federal power act trumps californias one nine nine six energy deregulation law lew rejected the pucs argument that he should dismiss the case because retail rates are exclusively a matter of state regulation the judge also rejected the agencys alternative request that he defer a decision for at least one two zero days while the puc gathered more facts the judge said the gravity of the situation required immediate action puc actions are having devastating effects on edisons current ability to obtain financing to enable it to continue to procure wholesale power at current prices lew said in essence lew agreed with edisons lawyers ronald l

institutions has increased nearly fourfold the attorneys said on the other side sce has been unable to recover these expenses through retail rates which are currently frozen under california law in addition edisons lawyers maintain that the puc has interpreted california law to prohibit sce from recovering these costs either now or in the future consequently edison has had to buy high and sell low leaving it with a shortfall in excess of two six billion the company says the puc counters that a substantial portion of edisons costs are paid to itself from power the company buys from its own plants and that edison has reaped additional billions in the last two years from the sale of certain assets the agency contends that those funds should be available to offset the financial problems the company is complaining about the puc also contends that edison failed to take other steps that could have lowered its costs in acquiring power in addition to the dispute over the facts there has been a clash over edison s contention that californias rate freeze interferes with federal regulation of the wholesale energy market the puc and the utility reform network counter that the freeze is an essential component of the federal regulatory commissions approval of wholesale sales the regulatory commission has taken no formal position on the pending litigation however douglas w smith the agencys general counsel sent a letter to edison attorney spiegel saying that the filed rate doctrine applies in a situation such as this the doctrine according to a one nine eight six us supreme court decision holds that interstate power rates filed with the federal regulatory commission or set by it must be given binding effect by state utility commissions determining intrastate rates however michael strumwasser attorney for the consumers group said the one nine eight six supreme court decision arose in an entirely different context he said the specific question now at issuewhether the filed rate doctrine applies when wholesale rates have been set by market forces rather than a regulatory proceedinghas never been ruled on by an appellate court lew made no explicit rulings on the puc allegations that edison should have offset wholesale payment costs through other revenues however lew said the puc is entitled to present evidence about the prudence of edisons wholesale electricity purchases further hearings on that issue could determine how much of its costs edison is entitled to recover the puc contends that edison could have made some purchases at lower prices than it did but edison attorneys counter that this is a disingenuous argument because the puc has not objected to the prudence of edisons purchases indeed the edison lawyers say the next phase of the case should be very brief because the puc in effect consented to edisons prior actions attorneys for the puc and the consumers group disagree sharply saying a bevy of issues need to be reviewed in detail there is no timetable for further proceedings in the edison case the next hearing on the pge case is scheduled for jan three zero in oakland news stealthy deal protects profits of pges parents christian berthelsen chronicle staff writer zero one one six two zero zero one the san francisco chronicle final aone copyright two zero zero one pge corp has quietly won approval from federal regulators to restructure itself in a way that shields the parent companys profits and shareholders from the mounting debts of the utility it owns the move appears to allow pacific gas and electric cos parent to record substantial profits while maintaining that its subsidiary which supplies power to four five million customers is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and trying to force ratepayers to pick up the tab the corporate restructuring approved by the federal energy regulatory commission on friday came as a surprise to consumer advocates and state leaders dealing with the energy crisis including gov gray davis they have been working feverishly the past seven days to construct a deal that would alleviate debt pressure on pge and southern california edison by having the state of california buy power and provide it to the utilities at cost steve moviglio a spokesman for davis said the governor was displeased by pges move although he said it was not likely to derail the states efforts to intervene in the crisis he also said davis was disappointed that ferc acted in the middle of the night without notice to all parties ratepayer advocates and even some state officials have said that any aid to the ailing utilities should be offset by the huge profits that pge corp has made during the crisis from electricity generation and trading revenues the money has certainly flowed in the other direction they argue in the past pge corp has used revenues from the utility to pay down corporate debt pay stock dividends and buy assets in other states pge corps action appears to eliminate that possible means of paying off at least part of the two billion in debt incurred since november by its utility pacific gas and electric co as it bought power at prices higher than it can legally charge customers its certainly a response to them feeling the threat that the holding companys going to be held responsible for all this said bob finkelstein an attorney for the utility reform network an advocacy group meanwhile californias energy crisis continued in full force yesterday as the california independent system operator issued a stage two emergency meaning that demand had reached within five percent of the states electric supply prompting requests to certain large users to shut down and conserve power this occurred despite a national holiday martin luther king day on which most businesses were closed and demand was forecast to reach about three zero zero zero zero megawatts a fairly modest number further conditions appeared as if they were going to worsen imminently edison said it will be unable to pay bills coming due today and pge said it has only about five zero zero million on hand to cover what it owes bankruptcy filings by both utilities appeared more likely state leaders were still in negotiations yesterday to broker a deal in which californias department of water resources would step in and buy power on behalf of the utilities who are facing a growing inability to pay for their purchases the talks were reported to be breaking down however because davis refused to consider raising california rates or backing utility debts with a letter of credit from the state in san francisco state senate president pro tem john burton said legislation passed last week by the assembly will probably make its way to the governors desk by the end of the month one bill would change the makeup of the boards that oversee the states power market and the other would prohibit utilities from selling off their powergenerating assets in the midst of yet another stage two electrical emergency the democratic leader said i want the people of california to have long stable available energy throughout the rest of our lives but in the short term with the threat of rolling blackouts and urgent requests for power conservation burton stated the obvious turn the goddamn lights off he said no challenges to restructuring the federal energy regulatory commission approved pges restructuring plan on a three toone vote on friday it was apparently described in a dec two eight public notice as a stock transfer and thus flew under the radar screens of most observers details of the plan were first reported in the wall street journal on monday greg pruett a spokesman for pge corp said the intent of the plan was merely to allow another unit of the corporate parent national energy group to receive its own credit rating that would be weighed independently of the troubled utility but he acknowledged that all or nearly all of pge corps assets outside the utility are held by national energy group and that the move would reduce the liability for the corporation although it was unclear whether pge informed state leaders of its plans pruett said the notice of the meeting was publicly available and had at least been provided to the public utilities commission in addition to proceeds from the sale of power plants and other revenues that pge has forwarded on to its corporate parent the utility has reaped windfall profits during the crisis from the generation and sale of electricity and has not applied those profits to its own debt to do so would require an accounting rule change by the california public utilities commission but company officials have maintained that should not be done pge in debt to itself critics say that pge is its own biggest debtor with money flying out of one pocket and into the other and that nearly half of its debt is owed to itself in the third quarter of two zero zero zero the company reported a two two percent increase in profits with a net income of two two five million while saying it expected california consumers to eventually pick up the tab for its debt on tap today shortage electricity demand is expected to grow as californians return to work from a threeday weekend increasing the likelihood of energy emergencies talks energy officials huddle in washington and sacramento over gov gray davis plan for the state to buy energy for the beleaguered utilities credit if wall street doesnt like the plan to rescue the states ailing utilities it may begin downgrading stock and bond

how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem for example complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality into the code regarding tanyas attitude just a few points one i dont think she has the skills to do the system administrators work and she does not have the necessary privileges this explains why she keeps asking winston for help its not that the work is beneath her two some members of tanyas team came to me complaining about winston he effectively told them to go away and work on the research projects and that he would take care of the it issues i dont think that its just tanyas issue though i agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful three the reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems andor they intuitively disagree with the results of a run they could not care less about the demarcation line between it and research they also want tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code the bottom line is that we are in full agreement tanya and winston have to work as a team and i shall work on my end to make sure that it happens credit is emerging as a critical issue for enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail vince from stephen stockenronenronxgate on zero one one one two zero zero one zero eight two three am to vince j kaminskihouectect cc subject progress vince i got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking about some specific solutions to performance of it systems in particular distributed processing also i heard that you had concerns about the use of multiple languages etc both of these sound like what i was discussing with you on previous occasions do you feel the need to discuss these further the multilanguage issue isnt really that much of an issue as the current system is nine eight java right now although i am a big fan of ccit is my main development skill i am also very aware that java is a much more evolved and robust language i had serious doubts about the performance but ive had a review conducted and the results are showing the sun unix implementation to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than cc because of something they call hotspot technology its an instruction caching technique i believe the concerns i expressed to you were really about how technical people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively meaningless metric like portability on the issue of distributed processing the original review i had conducted by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution and as zhiyong wei is already working on global valuation project winston is actively working with zhiyong to see if he can model the var architecture on that and also to find a common valuation piece between the systems id like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some time over the next few days also i sat in on the tanya winston meeting yesterday and as per our discussion at the elevator i attempted to help her argument by suggesting to all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code ie seperating research domain problems from it problems she said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were i asked her how she would measure that and she said she would instrument the code manually by inserting timing elements at strategic points i mentioned that a profiling tool could probably do this job for her tanya again said that stepping through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code and that studying documentation wasnt enough about six weeks ago i commissioned a team to document the system down to psuedocode level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon in fact ive asked for a draft copy to be given to tanya right now and winston is also working on a draft researchit working together document which will identify how the exchange of information takes place tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated it developer to do all the environment setup for her because she doesnt really want to have to do that i think that this is probably the root cause of the issue the it guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good as it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her she is claiming that they are uncooperative they are claiming that she continually asks the same questions about setup over and over again and doesnt seem to want to learn how to do it winston on the other hand could be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and an it issue and ask for help from research i think you debbie and i need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely i have asked tanya and winston to go ahead and work very closely together over the next few daysand debbie brackett and i will review their progress on friday in the meantime lll be looking at setting up a working test environment that doesnt involve my main quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer term solution regards steve,02:09:00

a one two th century villa surrounded by buff tan and unusually goodlooking farm workerstres important so yeah maybe well hold off on the visit for now i think its more important for us both to feel mentally stable about our finances for right now then we party i could maybe make it out there in april overlap with moms trip i dont think i could handle the whole thing with her ill keep it in mind and yeah shes giddy about this whole house move thing i hope it works out for the best i really think it will im starting to feel really bad about leaving kitty with her but im in a weird situation with ambers cat at our house already part of me wants to just bring kitty over and tell everyone to deal with it because its my house too but the other part of me doesnt want to deal with the bloodshed that will ensue between her and ambers outmatched feline oh well im thinking about it the most excitement ill be having this week is my haircut with brett tonight i think i might also be purchasing a bedskirt a totally extraneous and disappointing expense that i would never have had if i hadnt insisted on getting a real house with a real bed and all that other crap that goes along with it and inevitably costs you money that you could have otherwise spent on beer and as the sands flow these are the days of our lives im so impressed with your dating maneuvers i told amber and molly about it last night at dinner which we ate together around our new dining room table and they both said in unison like sister like sister i guess i have some kind of reputation for ending up on

supposedly coming out here in april and we might go to glenwood springs hot springs spa massages you should come too fun female family bonding time i am so excited for dad to visit not just because of the car but also because it will increase my quantity of social engagements by about one zero zero im a little worried about the effect its having on mom who asked me when he was coming so she wouldnt run into him like i would allow that to happen how stupid does she think i am but it sounds like shes pretty stoked about this house thing so im excited for her i have a date with that waiter guy tonight but im not really that excited because i am fat ugly and on the third day of my period did i mention broke and carless i think i should just put off this whole dating thing until i increase my net value to use katespeak which is just ground zero for most people i am trying to pay off some debt dad took care of most of it but i didnt have the heart to show him my nordstrom account its slowgoing though and car payments will not make it easy but seriously this city is so pedestrianunfriendly that i feel i have no choice i tried to go to my tennis lessons the other day and ended up walking along the shoulder of a highway for twenty minutes and every person in denver feels the need to own a dog and allow it to bark menacingly at every passerby i am so afraid of dogs after my brush with death in the form of a doberman so i need a car and i dont care if it means weekly visits to the plasma donation center i actually met markys ex the other night maybe dont mention to amber i dont know why but the whole thing seems weird and i would rather stay out of it anyway she is really cool she reminds me of my friend jen sturmer except less anorexic and depressed speaking of have you been going out in portland a lot i miss veritable quandary i havent found anything like that here yet downtown has some cool bars but you have to pay nine zero plus an appendage to park and cabs are not cheap either my neighborhood has some good dives like the one on our corner that has a flickering neon sign outside announcing dons mixed drinks not sure but think thats the name of the bar i went in once and met don the king of multiple body piercings here in denver okay im rambling time to get back to work which is so good lately by the way i get to start grantwriting this month hope

place rocky mountain lows amber tells me every time she talks to marky her man of the hour he mentions how theyve got to get together with you when she comes to town which will be on next friday whoo hoo party im so mad that she gets to go and i dont being that i am not like her in my eighth year of college and therefore do not enjoy such things as spring break mania anymore and monica tells marky who tells amber who tells me that shed love to hang out with you more often it sounds like you guys had a ball at dinner eh so youve got options girlfriend which is worlds more than i can say for my life at the mo it pretty much consists of working eating and sleeping im definitely looking into that sad mental disorder thing because i think its got me in its clutches but the recent abundance of sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life after winter were doing lots of gardening cooking and decorating at the house its like having three martha stewarts all working together only slightly less stylish immensely less efficient and drunk other than that ive been trying to organize and simplify my life taking care of mounds of paperwork paying off debts sorting out all those nagging little postit notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain im actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel like maybe i could buy a car or take a trip in a few months or even buy a second pair of shoes but lets not get wild and crazy just yet so i heard dad and laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an automobile that is in the immortal words of the guys in dude wheres my car sweet dude you are stoked i bet thats a major load off just make sure to keep your finances in check and not get in over your head take it

andy who laughed forcefully in my face when i told him i wanted to get into it but i figure im not getting any younger and i dont want any regrets so im goin for it dude as for the love life its nonexistant which is why im putting so much energy into the selfimprovement area of my life i figure as long as im having no fun with boys i might as well be beefing up my net value by the time they come around again the eligible pool will have shrunk to one in one zero zero million whatever anyway now that ive written you the longest paragraph of my life i must retreat to my work duties then its

adventure in the caribbean begins i am looking forward to meeting everyone relaxing and having a good time hope everyone has a very merry christmas and a happy new year looking forward to our precruise get together sat night the five th i was told the holland house beach bar if anyone knows different or a time let me know hope everyone enjoys the little christmas article below see everyone soon shelly b subject fw perfect christmas this article was submitted to a newspaper contest to find out who had the wildest christmas dinner this won first prize christmas with louise as a joke my brother used to hang a pair of panty hose over his fireplace before christmas he said all he wanted was for santa to fill them what they say about santa checking the list twice must be true because every christmas morning although jays kids stockings were overflowed his poor pantyhose hung sadly empty one year i decided to make his dream come true i put on sunglasses and went in search of an inflatable love doll they dont sell those things at walmart i had to go to an adult bookstore downtown if youve never been in an xrated store dont go youll only confuse yourself i was there an hour saying things like what does this do youre kidding me who would buy that finally i made it to the inflatable doll section i wanted to buy a standard uncomplicated doll that could also substitute as a passenger in my truck so i could use the car pool lane during rush hour finding what i wanted was difficult love dolls come in many different models the top of the line according to the side of the box could do things id only seen in a book on animal husbandry i settled for lovable louise she was at the bottom of the price scale to call louise a doll took a huge leap of imagination on christmas eve with the help of an old bicycle pump louise came to life my sisterinlaw was in on the plan and let me in during the wee morning hours long after santa had come and gone i filled the dangling pantyhose with louises pliant legs and bottom i also ate some cookies and drank what remained of a glass of milk on a nearby tray i went home and giggled for a couple of hours the next morning my brother called to say that santa had been to his house and left a present that had made him very happy but had left the dog confused she would bark start to walk away then come back and bark some more we all agreed that louise should remain in her panty hose so the rest of the family could admire her when they came over for the traditional christmas dinner my grandmother noticed louise the moment she walked in the door what the hell is that she asked my brother quickly explained its a doll who would play with something like that granny snapped i had several candidates in mind but kept my mouth shut where are her clothes granny continued boy that turkey sure smells nice gran jay said trying to steer her into the dining room but granny was relentless why doesnt she have any teeth again i could have answered but why would i it was christmas and no one wanted to ride in the back of the ambulance saying hang on granny hang on my grandfather a delightful old man with poor eyesight sidled up to me and said hey whos the naked gal by the fireplace i told him she was jays friend a few minutes later i noticed grandpa by the mantel talking to louise not just talking but actually flirting it was then that we realized this might be grandpas last christmas at home the dinner went well we made the usual small talk about who had died who was dying and who should be killed when suddenly louise made a noise that sounded a lot like my father in the bathroom in the morning then she lurched from the panty hose flew around the room twice and fell in a heap in front of the sofa the cat screamed i passed cranberry sauce through my nose and grandpa ran across the room fell to his knees and began administering mouth to mouth resuscitation my brother fell back over his chair and wet his pants and granny threw down her napkin stomped out of the room and sat in the car it was indeed a christmas to treasure and remember later in my brothers garage we conducted a thorough examination to decide the

with mike for two reasons one make sure enron and oxy had a project team in place asap and the resources are committed to do a world class job on the january two nine submission and subsequent presentations as mike noted we are in sudden death overtime and the two nine th could be the end of the tournament two revisit the street talk about enron redeploying capital mike walked through the egm organization talked about our stock multiple and how an announcement that we were putting huge dollars in saudi would hurt our stock price dale talked about their low multiple between four and five noted that the market viewed oxy as a company that could do deals buy and sell assets but really wasnt a growth company they now have a stable cash flow but need a new beach head in the middle east to demonstrate they are growing the point of this conversation was to tell us that debt reduction is also a top priority so they were also not interested in a big announcement about money being dumped into saudi arabia they characterized the saudi perspective as being one where they are looking for strategic partners who will be there for a long time and invest capital they agree on a division of labor oxy can do ep processing and petrochemicals and look to us for pipelines and power plants although oxy can do those too they realize that only enron has the marketing structuring and regulatory expertise casey did revisit his conversation with you about in the end enron ends up as some type of merchant banker thats ok in the end dale even said they would take over our part of any project but we cant project that role initially we need to be on the same side of the table as oxy the point here is that we have to be in step with a consistent approach to the projects they expect our competitors to say theyll finance things on balance sheet and we need initially to say the same thing although later we will open discussions on other ways to finance mike and i agree that this is probably the biggest sticking point in the discussion today oxy believes that such an initial statement will never be public and we arent really locked in an onbalance sheet approach maybe we can do this maybe we cant they see this as a year long process with pdas stretching well into next year and two zero zero two when the real money would be spent the short term crisis is january two nine and we need a submission with lots of pages we were criticized that although our proposal was well thought through and technically superb it didnt have enough pages reams of paper to impress the technocrats we will also need to prepare a smaller one five page digest to be used for our official february presentation and a three page walk around summary casey thinks the production center has to be in the us we also all agreed that the jan two nine questions allow us to lay out all of our downstream concerns and establish a placeholder for issues that must be resolved during the pda discussions before we would do a project i have had the greatest success around the world when we dont try to force immediately on a country a perfect gas or electric market but adapt to local conditions and implement the most important first couple of steps with the rest to follow later in this respect our projects can include suggested regulatory concepts that if successful can be used elsewhere in the kingdom over and over we came back to the project team which they want on the ground in saudi casey will be one zero zero saudi for the foreseeable future and can make all decisions who will be our lead person with the same authority they dont want to deal with someone who later says houston changed its mind a little arrogant when can we identify bodies and assignments and location they want full time dedicated people either dale or casey noted that the old enron would have parachuted a team in by now like south america where we landed in a swamp and spent the next five years beating alligators over the head with a stick this is a very complicated political and technical effort the leader has to be good at both casey was excited that rob would be assigned to the project i guess you discussed this with him they both were quick to say that the working relationship to date has been excellent and that they appreciate the effort we have put into this mike committed that we would go balls to the wall for the two nine th deadline i committed that i would designate a project team by the first week in january we had our first conference call yesterday but mike said he wanted to think about the decision point person and process we arent about to sacrifice a deliberative strategicconsensus thought process because they are in a hurry we spent a lot of time talking about the process we agree that the saudis will eliminate one or two participants that each project will have subparts with different combinations and leads of companies with a master jv on top they minimized the capital investment although they are prepared to spent two zero zero three zero zero million over the next three five years they see core project two costing six zero zero million six zero oxyenron assuming one other partner and enron half of that we arent talking billions spoken like a true major they are sure exxon mobil will be our red sea partner if only to earn face with possibly marathon as the other exxon is more interested in the chemical focus which oxy will concede to them mike noted was that our worst nightmare was a partner exxon who would throw away money just to have a presence we were assured that oxys only goal was to make money and if he projects didnt they would walk away the real danger in the upstream is the risk money for exploration oxy hopes to hedge this risk with downstream investments pipelines and plants and hopes that if the exploration is successful and reserves are added it will lead to a whole new series of projects they are very proud of oxys role in this claim that they were instrumental in getting petry parkman and morgan selected as advisors that irani is the most respected american arab business man and has great access in the kingdom and that they already know what investments partners are acceptable to the saudis we all left great friends in good christmas spirit from our perspective saudi is the largest economy in the middle east and the driver in international oil and liquids markets enron needs to get inside and establish relationships with the key saudi people we need a foot print in the kingdom with which to earn their respect can we do it with minimal capital investment saudi is about to embark of a complete electric and gas restructuring regulatory included they want the repatriation of petro dollars and dollars held offshore by saudi nationals the country can be a tremendous source of capital it looks like two zero zero one can be managed with a minimum burn rate with the most intense period of activity being in january we need to set up the team for the january effort ill have this done by jan one there is the question of sorting out conflicts with other me priorities although it may be too soon to answer we dont know yet what is possible but we can shape that outcome what is the end game what do we want out of saudi arabia we seem to have a clear division of labor and strategy with oxy although we need to sort out what we say about on balance sheet financing we also need to keep in mind that our other yet to be met partners will have a lot to say oxy wants to take the lead on the core venture two red sea i agree this is a perfect laboratory to address all of the market structure issues that will make the kingdom a great place to do business mike im sure you can add more rick its up to you if you want to send this around to the saudi team merry christmas,05:28:00

and danish neg micon according to danish windpower consultancy btm germany installed one six six five megawatts of wind capacity in two zero zero zero followed by spains one zero two four mw while installed capacity worldwide rose one five percent to four four nine five mw we regard growth in the german market as stable in coming years and expect growth to continue in spain poulsen said to meet the german wind turbine demand vestas said it would build a turbine blade factory in either germany poland or hungary with a final decision on which country to be announced at the companys general meeting on may three poulsen said today the company has seven factories in denmark and one in germany italy and india in spain vestas indirectly owns one zero plants through its four zero percent owned wind turbine firm gamesa eolica part of spanish gamesa group vestas will also soon build an tower construction and assembly plant in scotland poulsen said vestas expected wind power installations worldwide to leap three zero percent annually over the next three years and with the companys expectations of annually sales growth at four zero percent vestas is set to gain market share focus on the us following germany and spain the us is seen as the thirdlargest wind turbine market in two zero zero one but new orders have come to a halt as windpark developers await an extension of the favourable production tax credit agreement ptc which expires by the end of two zero zero one last week us president george w bush in his fiscal two zero zero two budget proposed expanding the one five cent tax credit for each kilowatthour of electricity produced from wind for three more years to two zero zero four its positive the bush administation favours ptc now it seems more certain an extension will happen johannes polusen said btm predicted in a recent report the us would install one three five zero mw this year falling to eight zero zero mw next year and one zero zero zero mw in two zero zero three assuming that the us did not extend the ptc agreement the figures would be significantly higher if the tax credit was extended a btm analyst said according to the monthly magazine renewable energy world the american wind energy association forecasts two zero zero zero mw of new wind turbine installations in the us this year we do not expect more huge orders from the us until late this year as customers are awaiting an approval of the tax proposal but we might get a few small orders poulsen said vestas has plans of a blade and assembly plant in the us ready in case the tax credit deal is extended he said poulsen rejected the idea of acquiring us energy group enrons wind turbine arm enron wind corp with a world market share of six percent which according to market sources has been put up for sale to control the massive market growth we have to grow organically poulsen said copyright two zero zero zero dow jones company inc all rights

eight reuters hailed as a new frontier for financial markets bandwidth trading is struggling to get a footing as capacity piles up prices fall and expectations float back to earth a supply glut especially on long distance routes between large cities is dragging down prices and investment on new capacity has slowed considerably as demand flags but trading will pick up in two to three years as the market matures say analysts there is nothing going on out there the business is viable but we are ahead of the curve said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey bandwidth is the transmission capacity of an electronic line used to send data from one point to another as on the internet the trading of bandwidth helps facilitates deals and hedges against risk while the bandwidth market was all the rage the previous three years this year has seen a fallout in the industry enron corp billed as the biggest bandwidth trader said april six it would cut two zero percent of the jobs at its broadband unit because of slow demand for streaming media products to personal computers there will be some shakeout in demand growth and pricing but longterm demand and growth will be there said seth libby analyst at consulting firm the yankee group market failures market inefficiencies such as unresolved issues like credit and market enforcement have retarded trading what is needed according to san franciscobased online exchange ratexchange corp is a standardized contract that would provide the framework for commoditylike trading without such agreement buyers and sellers of bandwidth need to agree on new terms for each transaction said michael rose ratexchanges director of business development we do not yet have a fully functioning market said rose however analysts liken todays trading market to the power market which took more one zero years to get off the ground todays market problems are just growing pains said rod kuckro managing editor of the bandwidth market report which is published by mcgraw hill co kuckro sees growth picking up over the next three years fallout market inefficiencies are not the only problem bandwidth trading faces a supply glut has dragged down prices exact numbers are hard to come by in the bandwidth trading market but industry experts say only about one zero percent or even less of existing fiber optic capacity for bandwidth is lit or in use in the united states obviously there is some capacity problems out there and there will be funding problems going forward said credit lyonnais securities analyst gordon howald it is now cheaper to buy or lease lines than to take the risk of digging in the ground and laying new lines as a result companies are not investing as much in construction for example enron slashed its capital spending on its fiber optic network to about two five zero million this year from an earlier estimated budget of seven five zero million demand for capacity has also fallen short of expectations the traditional bandwidth business plan read just build it and they will come but this did not pan out said libby consequently todays market has more sellers than buyers and as new players enter the market like global crossing ltd and energy companies dominion resources and dynegy inc competition has heated up but this might just be what the doctor ordered as prices keep falling carriers who were reluctant to embrace bandwidth trading are taking a longlook because of the increased efficiencies offered by trading somewhat perversely this fallout might hasten trading as companies are forced to compete more fiercely with new players said kuckro last mile hurdle think of driving from new york to washington the highway is mostly free of congestion but traffic jams abound in the cities the same holds true for bandwidth connections bottlenecks in the last mile have kept prices high despite a glut in longhaul capacity and unused darkfibers bandwidth trading which does not always provide a looptoloop service suffers as a result nobody want to buy longhaul capacity and then haggle and worry about the local loop warns seth libby who said he is unaware of any bandwidth trades that included the final link however analyst see the last mile problem as just another hurdle bandwidth trading will get around to deal with somebody is going to step up to plate said libby while analysts expect the majority of bandwidth deals to remain carriertocarrier the trading market is expected to blossom as the kinks in the system get ironed out everyone is dressed for a party but there is no party to go to yet

war victory by andrei khalip zero four one eight two zero zero one reuters english news service c reuters limited two zero zero one rio de janeiro april one eight reuters britains bg group plc claims to have won a litmus test battle in brazil by gaining access to a key natural gas pipeline which marks a big step to a free market and a defeat for exmonopoly petrobras bgs director for corporate affairs in southern south america francois moreau said the final decision earlier this week by the energy regulatory body anp to allow bg to use the boliviabrazil pipeline in two zero zero one two zero zero three was an important victory although not all of bgs demands were met bg has big expansion plans for its brazilian distribution affiliate comgas and the longawaited access to the line that brings natural gas from bgs own production fields in bolivia is crucial for the realization of those plans the anp has confirmed that it wants the private initiative to have a greater role in the energy sector that it stands for a competitive market and is ready to fight petrobras we view it as a test case for an open market in brazil moreau said the anp already authorized usbased enron corp to use the pipeline but only when it had idle capacity analysts now expect enron and other companies to follow bgs suit and demand uninterrupted use of the pipeline under the present deal bg is allowed to import two four five million cubic feet seven zero zero zero zero zero cubic meters of gas per day from april to august and from september until the end of two zero zero two it can import seven three five million cubic feet two one million cubic meters the anps decision initially came out last month but tbg the gas transportation unit of brazils stateowned oil company petrobras which operates the line rushed to challenge it insisting that it had no free capacity petrobras sees the transportation as means to protect its monopoly even the anp admits that there are elements of anticompetition actions in what they are doing moreau claimed petrobras officials said they had no comment on the issue anp said petrobras could appeal to a court but there was no way the anp would review its decision anp president david zylbersztajn told reporters on wednesday that he saw the issue as closed and the parties involved would have to sign a contract in a weeks time he did not rule out fresh resistance from petrobras but warned that his agency was determined to tame the state energy giant that officially lost its monopoly rights in oil and gas production and distribution in one nine nine seven anps game is to crush this resistance he said despite the important victory bg has lost its own latest appeal with the anp the company had wanted a firm deliveries regime to last until endtwo zero zero three but the agency ruled that after two zero zero two tbg may interrupt deliveries on anps permission however moreau said that he was now pinning his hopes on a new set of rules for gas transportation that the anp is preparing and should release in may those were expected to limit petrobras role in the future expansion of the gas transportation system provide more transparency in striking contracts for delivery and in general bring more healthy competition to the market he said that in his view demand for natural gas in brazil was likely to rise with time requiring a five zero percent expansion of the boliviabrazil pipeline that now can carry one one billion cubic feet three zero million cubic meters of gas per day brazil aims to boost the share of natural gas in its energy market to one zero one two percent by two zero one zero from the present fledgling three percent by encouraging the construction of gasfired electric energy plants to alleviate the countrys heavy dependence on hydroelectric plants and by greater industrial use of gas moreau said bg was interested in taking part in any expansion projects both of the pipeline and of the network inside brazil as well as signing more longterm transportation contracts if the environment is competitive bg is already building a pipeline to transport gas from argentina to southern brazil where it will be linked to an existing pipeline and carry gas to comgas base of sao paulo brazils main industrial hub and richest state moreau said the group which bought comgas two years ago for nearly one billion planned to

is not the business deal then the change is fine two i think a one zero business days is fine that being said you usually dont indicate an acceptance of a right to match with the payment of the purchase offer we could submit a binding acceptance but i dont think we want to agree to pay the purchase price when all that ballentine may put in front of us is a term sheet with the specifics of the deal to be negotiated i also dont think we want to go to the trouble of escrowing the money maybe we could do an earnest money deposit but then we need to add language as to when we get it back if you and danny want to keep the submission of the purchase price we need to include the language as to when we get the money back as well the easiest fix for this deal is just saying we will submit a

Bear Mauls Plans For New Generators In West,fyi story on the effect of ferc prices on supply in pnw best jeff powermarket bear mauls plans for new generators in west by mark golden of dow jones newswires zero seven two six two zero zero one dow jones energy service copyright c two zero zero one dow jones company inc new york dow jones the crumbling price of electricity in the western us attributed by many to federal price controls has forced power plant developers to cancel projects calling into question whether there will be enough electricity to meet demand in the northwest this winter the cancellations of peaking plants and temporary oilfired generators highcost units that provide power needed only when demand is highest have cut projected generating capacity in the northwest by up to one zero zero zero megawatts about three of the combined peak demand of washington oregon idaho and western montana the price caps have added uncertainty said scott simms spokesman for enron corp ene unit portland general electric co if we look forward to this winter and you see a diminished supply scenario you can see why we have concerns about regional reliability that could put us in a position of having rotating outages in the region about two weeks after the federal energy regulatory commission imposed limits on western power prices on june one nine portland general halted installation of a new four five megawatt gasfired peaking turbine at its existing boardman power plant the utility was developing the extra generation both to meet its customers needs and to sell some output to other northwest utilities left short of hydroelectric supplies due to this years drought a turbine that size could power about four five zero zero zero homes you can directly attribute that to ferc price controls simms said after the ferc order at least two utilities in washington state ended negotiations with nrg energy nrg for supplies from new plants that nrg was ready to build in time for winter both utilities tacoma power and snohomish county public utility district experienced significant supply shortages in the past one two months paid very high prices in the spot market and had to raise customer electric rates by as much as five zero but both utilities told nrg and later dow jones newswires that they had no reason to sign longterm contracts to guarantee new supplies because the ferc had practically eliminated the financial risk of relying on the spot market nrg as a result scuttled plans to build peaking plants in washington that could have added three zero zero megawatts fercs price controls as well as supplydemand fundamentals have dramatically changed the economics of selling power into the wests open market in the past few months the current western us electricity price cap of nine eight a megawatthour covers the costs of generating power from easytoinstall but inefficient peaking turbines but not the capital costs of buying and installing new peakers in addition the current price cap may soon be recalculated to a much lower level the cap is based largely on natural gas prices which have been cut in half since the cap was first formulated in june not everyone blames ferc the average monthly price for onpeak hours in the northwest from august through march is six zero a megawatthour a fraction of what it was three months ago many in the western electricity industry think thats because fercs price controls have kept prices artificially low a smaller group thinks the market is appropriately signaling that not all the planned gasfired plants are needed because some power plants are already under construction and consumers are conserving electricity jim kemp a senior executive for the canadian utility transaltas tato merchant power group transalta tato for example doesnt attribute the cancellation of projects to price controls i see it as due to demandside control and new units kemp said the market is sending out a signal that we have enough maybe this winter we will find that we dont have enough but thats not the signal the market is sending now the spot market for power has been far below the federal price cap for two months mild weather a slowing economy and conservation efforts throughout the west have made power from expensive peaking plants unnecessary except for a few hours so far this summer prices started to come down before the ferc mitigation plan started said tacoma power supply analyst david lucio who was negotiating with nrg the need to try to execute a contract wasnt as great with the prices falling lucio said there should be enough capacity to get the northwest through the winter barring abnormalities like a long extended freeze construction of dozens of peaking plants in the west is going forward in cases where developers sold supply contracts in advance transalta is continuing construction of a one five four megawatt peaking plant in washington because much of the plants capacity was sold months ago the number of announced projects is far and away more than what is needed within the time frame were talking about said dick watson a director with the northwest power planning council still several western utilities have asked the ferc to raise the price cap puget sound energy psd told the ferc the cap undercuts the commissions efforts to ensure adequate supplies of electricity as previously reported some small oilfired generators which are even more expensive to operate than the permanent gasfired peaking plants have even been taken off line permanently after being installed over the past six months and orders for new generators have been canceled by mark golden dow jones newswires two zero one nine three eight four six zero four markgoldendowjonescom

ferc voted out an order granting in part and denying in part the reli ant mirant complaint against caiso the order builds on the one one seven creditw orthiness order and finds that dwr is a

the discussion on this item massey noted concern about caiso allega tion that the beep stack is not reliable bc generators are not following d ispatch instructions massey wants caiso to promptly inform the commission where they believe an entity is not complying with the tariff or failing t o follow the dispatch instruction two the second set of orders involves three dockets a a new two zero

market mitigation for entities w ith market power pursuant to the order in b ferc is putting out a new rulingmaking regarding marketbased rate authorit y to close what they find to be a flaw with existing tariffs in the wake of californias problems the rulemaking initiated today calls for the impos ition of a refund provision in all marketbased rates the refund requirem ent attaches to bad behavior such as economic or physical withholding or other anticompetitive actions apparently there is a portion of the rulema king that asks for comments within one five days during discussion massey poin ted out that no bad behavior was found in california and that customers should not be forced to bear the burden where the market goes out of contro l ferc has revised the market power analysis used to support a request for ma rketbased rate authority ferc is now establishing a supply margin analy sis sma to replace the hub spoke analysis used to determine the pres ence of market power the sma looks for pivotal suppliers based on peak demand within a market the definition of the market would recognize the r ole of transmission constraints a generator is considered pivotal where its supply is required to meet system peak demand if such status is foun d the marketbased rate authority does not extend to those peak conditions and instead the applicable rates are a costbased rate that is applicable only to the uncommitted unit capacity rates for any such capacity would be posted in incs and decs for that uncommitted capacity this policy revi sion occurs in the context of a triennial review of market based rate autho rity for aep southern and entergy additional details will be in the orde r and well send an email with links when it gets posted the last item would create

on conditions imposed on aoltime warner merger one of the fccs last major actions during the tenure of chairman william e kennard marks the agencys first effort to oversee internet instant messaging services the move last night came as the fcc announced its longawaited decision to clear the merger of america online inc and time warner inc all five commissioners voted to approve the mergerrelated application but the majoritys vote to attach conditions as competitive safeguards prompted sharp criticism from the person widely expected to succeed mr kennard commissioner michael k powell warned that the fcc was taking a substantial leap by declaring broad jurisdiction over the internet and commissioner harold furchtgottroth reiterated his strong view that the fcc lacks authority to extract conditions through its public interest reviews of mergerrelated license transfers the fccs merger conditions mandate that the combined company known as aol time warner incallow all customers to choose internet service from any unaffiliated isp that has a contract with the merged company to use its cable tv facilities customers must be able to have their chosen isps provide their first screen when they go online without going through an aol time warneraffiliated isp as an intermediary the merged company must allow unaffiliated isps to have direct billing relationships with its subscribers and it may not discriminate in favor of its affiliated isp in terms of caching services customer technical support multicasting capabilities address management or other technical functions the fcc also indicated its concern that without conditions aol time warner would be able to leverage its dominance in textbased instant messaging im into the nontextbased im market as a condition of the merger approval therefore the fcc prohibited aol time warner from offering any new advanced imbased highspeed service aihs feature or enhancement that includes one or two way streaming video communications using a names and presence directory npd the prohibition could be lifted however if aol time warner demon strated that it had complied with certain safeguards commissioner powell said the majority had given in too much to their collective imaginations in imposing the im conditions in a separate statement he said he was unwilling to join them in mak ing the substantial leap to find that the fcc has jurisdiction to regulate virtually every internet product neither the record nor anticompetitive theory supports mandating im interoperability mr powell said no competent antitrust authority to my mind would conclude intervention was necessary nor do i believe such an analysis would withstand judicial review he said during a press briefing this morning mr kennard insisted that the im conditions were very narrowly tailored and minimally intrusive although he wouldnt speak directly to mr powells criticism the chairman said at the end of the day i feltand my two other colleagues feltthat in order to protect consumers we had to impose some conditions for more details see mondays tr kennard submits resignation plans to leave fcc post for think tank fcc chairman william e kennard has submitted his resignation to the white house effective jan one nine and will take a temporary senior fellow position at the aspen institute a think tank in washington ending a threeyear term as the

merger see story above at the aspen institute mr kennard will be advisory board chairman of the communications and society program although his term on the commission does not expire until the end of june mr kennard said our work is complete and its time for me to go most industry observers predict that presidentelect george w bush will appoint fcc commissioner michael k powell chairman in one scenario some see as likely president bush could nominate texas public utility commission chairman patrick h wood iii to be an fcc commissioner to succeed mr kennard after mr wood had been con firmed and dealt with federal communications industry issues for a while he could be named chairman of the agency leaving mr powell free to accept another appointment possibly in the justice depart ment

may fcc wont preempt missouri ban on cityowned telecom utilities the fcc today said it wouldnt preempt a missouri state law that effectively forbids cityowned utilities from providing telecom services the showme state cities had tried to distinguish their request from that of texas cities that had asked in vain for fcc preemption of a similar law several years ago in the texas case the fcc refused to a preempt a state law barring cities from offering telecom services directly the missouri cities argued that their situation was different because they wished to offer telecom services through municipal utility companies but the fcc said that in general such utilities are a part of the state itself and therefore dont fall under provisions in section two five three of the federal telecommunications act of one nine nine six barring states from preventing an entity from entering a telecommunications service market if a municipal utility has an independent corporate identity thats separate from the state however it may be eligible for protection under those barriertoentry provisions found in sec tion two five three of the act the fcc said the missouri utility company didnt show that they had such an independent identity it added in statements released with the decision fcc chairman william e kennard and commissioners gloria tristani and susan ness said the utility companies represented a promising class of competitors they asked congress to amend the language in that section to address clearly municipallyowned entities ms ness also suggested that states adopt less restrictive measures such as separation or nondiscrimination requirements to prevent cityowned utilities from having unfair competitive ad vantages over privatesector service providers alcatel to

vasconcellos brent bowes bill sandt jim subject raptor restructuring gentlemen after talking with both joel ephross and ron baker this morning about the raptor restructuring my understanding of the current plan is summarized below please let me know if i have mischaracterized the proposed approach we have a couple concerns from a tax perspective that are also discussed below one ve is currently drafting documents to allow each raptor structure to look to the other structures in terms of credit capacity two the previously proposed assignment of the ldc swaps from raptor ii to raptor iv is off the table these swaps will now be terminated three either raptor ii or raptor iv will be used to hedge the mariner investment three six zero m instead four the jedi structure is expected to be unwound thus allowing one two m enron corp shares to come back to enron corp and no longer be treated as issued and outstanding for purposes of enrons eps calculation five the value of one two m new enron corp shares would be used to capitalize either raptor ii or raptor iv one two m shares x seven zero approx eight four zero m a as consideration for the contribution of the shares the receivable owed by the lower tier llc to the enron member under the grid note would be increased by the same amount b the credit capacity of the subject raptor structure would increase by an amount equal to the discount on the shares caused by their restricted nature eight four zero m x three five to four five approx two nine four m to three seven eight m c ryan has apparently suggested that the shares actually be transferred to a trust and that the trust issue a forward contract on the shares to the chosen raptor structure we have some concerns about this approach from a tax perspective i would like to better understand the benefits of using a forward contract who would own the beneficial interest in the trust and what followon transactions might be planned regarding the trust d i am still confused about the characterization of the contribution of the additional shares as utilizing the credit capacity of the raptor structure to which they are contributed i can understand why the shares would not increase the credit capacity of the structure but i am told that the potential downside on the enron stock would actually utilize the structures capacity annmarie original message from

circuit breaker enron dumps cfo amid conflict questions by stephen taub enron corp is set to replace cfo andrew fastow as cfocom reported in a story earlier this week fastows role in a limited

two zero zero zero mcmahon was enrons treasurer he resigned that post in part because he disapproved of fastows role in running two partnerships according to the wall street journal in my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo said kenneth l lay enron chairman and ceo in a statement mcmahon four zero joined enron in one nine nine four and spent three years in the london office as cfo for the companys european operations upon returning to the united states mcmahon assumed the post of evp of finance and treasurer for enron corp in two zero zero zero he was named president and coo of enron net works where he focused on ecommerce activities as reported on friday the wall street journal said a limited partnership organized by fastow who has been enrons cfo since one nine nine seven racked up millions of dollars in profits from transactions conducted with the energy company on monday enron said the securities and exchange commission requested information regarding certain related party transactions on october one six enron stunned wall street when it announced that it would take a one zero one billion aftertax charge for the september three zero quarter since the announcement enrons share price has more than halved fastows dismissal seems to be an aboutface for enron in a conference call tuesday lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and took steps to assure that there was no conflict as fastow played both roles enron has since dissolved the partnerships obviously the board and even the lawyers and auditors realized that there would be an apparent conflict of interest there and the board prescribed certain methods for it to be dealt with so enron would never be compromised lay said in published accounts we are very concerned at the way andys character has been loosely thrown about in certain articles as well as the companys reputation predictably on wednesday at least two law firms stull stull brody and bernstein liebhard lifshitz llp filed classaction suits against enron lay fastow and jeffrey k skilling the former enron chief executive who resigned in august the suits allege that the defendants issued false and misleading information that materially misstated the companys condition and prospects to the investing public moreover the suits argue that the company failed to disclose material information necessary to make its prior statements not misleading the complaints charge that enron issued a series of statements concerning its business financial results and operations which failed to disclose among other things the companys broadband services division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the companys efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy the companys operating results were materially overstated since enron failed to write down in a timely fashion the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships the partnerships that were managed by fastow enron was failing to write

Please Review,dear amu student we have made changes to the proctored final exam process this year many of you are aware of the current online proctoredexam process but i wanted to send a quick note to all of our students containing a brief overview of the online examproctor process this information will be updated over the next few weeks in your online student handbook see the toolbar inside your electronic campus one all aspects of the exam process are coordinated and orchestrated between the professor student and proctor two when the semester begins all students should check the student course guide inside their classrooms to see if they have an online proctoredexam in their courses if there is a proctored exam the student will need to locate a proctor general guidelines on proctors can be found in the handbook via this link httpwwwamunetedugeneralinformationstudenthandbookaspone zero six the student will need to agree upon a scheduled date to take the exam with the proctor three as of summer two zero zero one the proctor will need an email address the proctor will also need to provide the student access to a computer for up to three four hours the length of your exam time if this is absolutely impossible the student and the professor may be able to determine alternative optionsie having the proctor print out the exam for the student to take then mailing it to the professor having the proctor closely monitor the student as she takes it on a laptop then sends it to the professor via email or some other solution agreed to by all parties involved four at some point during the semester the professor will post the final exams in the online classroom students will be able to see this because when they click on exams inside the classroom the will see a title appearing under final exam when the student cannot see a title for the final exam the professor has not posted the exam yet five after the professor has posted the exam the student will be able to nominate a proctor using these instructions located inside the handbook httpwwwamunetedugeneralinformationstudenthandbookaspthree three five six the professor will see when a student has nominated a proctor and she will send a password to the proctor via email the proctor simply needs to save this password until the day of the exam either she can save the email in a file or print it out if their offices procedures are more hardcopy seven prior to exam day it is a good idea for the student to contact the proctor to verify that a password has been received if it has not the student needs to contact the professor and ask that it be sent or resent as the case may be eight on exam day the student arrives logs on to the electronic campus and enters the classroom for the exam the student clicks exams and the final exam and will see a page with a textbox appear the proctor will enter the password sent by the professor in the textbox and the student will gain access to the exam the student will finish the exam inside the classroom the professor will be able to see instantly when the student finishes the exam and it is ready to be graded two weeks after the end date of the course provided no extension agreements have been made the professor will post the students final grade in the course so its as easy as that thank you for taking the time to review this email if you have questions about the exam process please let me know best regards kathie ferrette dean of students amu studentsamunetedu,12:13:03

seven five six am fergus gary s gfergusbrobeckcom one zero two four two zero zero zero zero four four five pm to richard b sanders esq email richardbsandersenroncom cc meringolo peter pmeringolobrobeckcom subject some thoughts on options privileged and confidential attorney client privilege richard after todays discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on options one wait for a better protective order ask harvey morris where they are on fixing the protective order that is being litigated by others if the protective order has not changed then unilaterally postpone production until it is pro better protection and more time con even with a more stringent protective order enron still questions whether the puc is entitled to financial performance data thus this option does not fully disclose all of enrons positions and the company may be accused later of simply engaging in delaying tactics under this option we file our formal objections as well two turn over the transaction data as is continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for electricity that was delivered pro puc will get the data anyway either through ferc unfair competition antitrust or price gouging litigation by turning over the data that will show profits puc might slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by seeking to depose witnesses etc con this would be waiving the legitimate question that enron has as to the pucs ability to discovery this information through a subpoena there is also a question of how confidential this data would be given the current political agenda it might also serve to whet the appetite of the puc for more enron information and discovery this option would also provide confidential proprietary information to the puc about how enron gets its competitive advantage three turn over data for outside of california and let puc get rest of data from iso and px we have told the puc we do not want to duplicate the efforts of iso and px so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give only missing data pro it would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of california data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question con without enron cost data for the california iso and px transactions the puc would not be able to arrive at what they want a profit and loss picture we would have a hard time representing to the puc that the combination of the puc data and the enron data would be all that they need to calculate the answers to request nos seven one zero four turn over everything but price this option would simple omit the price data pro it would not reveal the profit and loss information con it would not reveal the profit and loss information in other words the puc is clear that this is what they are after by giving them everything else we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and loss moreover by piecing some of it together with the iso and px data the puc might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be quite large but just not the cost or expense side five decline to produce the data we would tell harvey morris that enron has reconsidered its position for the following reasons one our firm belief that the puc is not entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking two in his latest email harvey has made it clear that the puc wants more data one nine nine nine than we discussed earlier three continued threat that if they do not like the transaction data they will come back and ask for profit and loss information that we do not believe they are entitled to four commissioner woods statement that the purpose of this investigation is to get money from market participants in the hands of consumers five investigation by the ag into activities of other market participants and the notice that other governmental agencies are cooperating who are we producing this information to and for what purpose six enron favors public disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to do so seven enron is a small player in this market and many other market participants are not involved in the process bpa etc pro this may be the only way to preserve enrons challenge to the jurisdiction of the puc to get this data moreover in the current political environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked it also makes sense to see what ferc will do with their published one one one zero zero report on investigation date under this option we file our formal objections and sit back and wait six me too upon reflection we agree with the approach taken by the other market participants we will not produce until the protective order is modified and then only data that is within the puc jurisdiction pro this makes it look like all the market participants are acting in concert and really is no different than option one above moreover if you read reliants responses they appear ready to turn over financial data if the protective order is modified terry and mike day are both out of their offices today note that williams is adopting a strategy that says the puc needs to go to superior court to enforce its subpoena this may be met with strong opposition by the puc given their california constitutional contempt authority seven move to quash before the alj here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the puc does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits before the alj pro the alj is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions it has the least procedural risks of being dismissed con reading the tea leaves we believe it unlikely that the alj will determine that the puc has no jurisdiction moreover because the puc has its own constitutionally granted contempt power the puc will take the view according to mike day that they need not go to the superior court for enforcement they will also take the view that the superior court has no jurisdiction to hear our appeal appeals have to go to the puc and those orders are appealable at the court of appeal level thus the only de novo review of our objections might be at the alj level eight file declaratory relief action in federal court in california we would claim federal question jurisdiction under the federal power act and in particular the provisions of eight two four g under which the puc issued its subpoena in part the dispute to be decided is whether the puc has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and loss information from the wholesale market the authority for this would be mississippi power light v mississippi four eight seven us three five four bright line between wholesale market regulated by ferc and the retail market regulated by states bristol energy corp v new hampshire one three fthree d four seven one one st cir one nine nine four federal question whether state agency can inquire into business and financial data in the wholesale market but found no cognizable claim pro the federal forum may be more even handed than the alj but the question is whether we can state a cognizable claim there may be greater protections from disclosure of the information as well con the puc may continue on a parallel track unless we are able to obtain injunctive relief the puc might seek discovery of the same information in the federal court proceeding we should assume that this action will trigger the strongest response from the puc andor the ag in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same information eg unfair business practice suit price gouging antitrust etc we should anticipate deposition requests for traders etc by taking this position we will clearly be conceding that if ferc asks for the data it is germane to their authority nine separate responsesstrategies for different enron entities it may make some sense to chart a different course for portland general ees and eemc and continue to produce some data from those entities pro the information provided for these entities is not likely to generate profit and loss information that would be germane to the fight we are about to engage in eg eess

zero new york times company goodyear texaco colgatepalmolive mci worldcom and eight other large corporations earned more than one two two billion in profits in one nine nine six through one nine nine eight but none of them ended up owing corporate income taxes over that period according to a study released yesterday indeed as a group the companies received five three five million in credits or refunds the report found the study of two five zero large publicly traded companies showed that two four owed no tax or received credits against past or future tax obligations in one nine nine eight up from one three in one nine nine seven and one six in one nine nine six the study also found that seven one of the two five zero companies paid taxes at less than half the official three five percent corporate rate during the threeyear period the study was conducted by the institute on taxation and economic policy a washington research organization associated with citizens for tax justice a nonprofit group supported in part by labor unions the group argues that the tax system favors the rich and politically connected corporate profits overall soared two three five percent during the threeyear period but corporate tax revenues grew just seven seven percent a disjunction that has drawn intense interest from the treasury department and some members of congress who are concerned about the growing market for tax shelters and their abuse in recent years congress has watered down the one nine eight six overhaul of the tax laws which lowered rates and eliminated most tax shelters and was supposed to simplify reporting the recent changes have opened fresh opportunities for corporations to cut their taxes the study found corporate taxes are not rising along with profits because companies have found all sorts of ways to get around the reforms in the one nine eight six tax act said robert s mcintyre the director of citizens for tax justice companies also have gotten a lot of help from congress especially in gutting the minimum tax rules mr mcintyre said that he and t d coo nguyen the coauthor spent more than two years examining financial statements the companies sent to shareholders all but one eight of the companies studied are on the fortune five zero zero list and the others are in the fortune one zero zero zero he said companies were excluded if they lost money or their tax disclosures were crafted so that you could not figure them out at least two companies objected to the studys methodology keith price a spokesman for goodyear said the study did not appear to consider an accounting rule affecting its sale of a pipeline subsidiary in one nine nine eight it made no objection to the one nine nine six and one nine nine seven figures michael n ambler texacos chief tax counsel said that his company had tax disputes with the internal revenue service that were unresolved after more than a decade if those disputes are settled with a refund he said that can easily distort the figures for any one year he said that even the threeyear study period was too short to give an accurate picture timothy mccormally of the tax executives institute which represents officials at large companies told bloomberg news that the companies named in the report did nothing wrong there is nothing in the report that suggests that any of this results from any illegal or improper activity he said the study by the washington institute showed that the corporate tax burden was falling in many cases because of the growing use of stock options which are an expense for tax purposes but do not count against profits reported to shareholders recent annual reports filed by microsoft and cisco systems indicate that they paid no federal income taxes in one nine nine nine because stock options exercised by employees wiped out profits for tax purposes the study found that general electric ibm pfizer intel and bristolmyers squibb also sharply reduced their tax rates because of stock options without having to show reduced earnings to shareholders the most significant factor in the easing corporate tax burden mr mcintyre said can be traced to actions in congress which relaxed the corporate minimum tax in one nine nine three when the democrats were in control of both the house and senate and again in one nine nine seven after the republicans had taken over congress made it easier for corporations to spread tax breaks and profits over many years including reaching back to past years to get tax breaks that could not be used at the time in at least one of the three years studied four one of the two five zero large companies studied paid no federal income tax those four one companies reported two five eight billion in profits to shareholders in the years they paid no taxes if they had been obligated to pay the full three five percent corporate rate the tax bill would have been nine billion but the companies received three two billion in refunds in total dollars general electric was the biggest beneficiary of tax breaks the study said saving six nine billion in three years the company paid two one billion in income taxes on two five eight billion in profits for a tax rate of eight one percent the highest tax rate for the three years was paid by winndixie stores which paid an average of three five seven percent of its one nine nine six

benefits some question propertysales tax numbers new development by eric berger copyright two zero zero zero houston chronicle enron field sparked the redevelopment of downtowns east side boosters say and an arena would crown the revitalization of the longneglected area a strongly proarena business organization central houston inc released a flurry of positive economic numbers to back its contention that enron field is a boon to downtown as well as to city county and school tax coffers and that the arena would be as well theres no better way to measure the impact of sports facilities on downtown than to look at the one we already have said the organizations president bob eury as he crooked a finger toward the ballpark eury and other boosters outlined three economic benefits to houston they say are related to sports facilities increased property tax revenues a wealth of new development in the area and a boost in sales tax collected but economic analysts questioned some of their conclusions when enron field was built nine blocks were taken off the tax rolls at a cost of about two eight four zero zero zero in lost property taxes eury said though that it was not a bad trade he noted that properties around the ballpark have leaped in value since the enron field project began in the midone nine nine zero s in turn the annual property tax collected on land and buildings within four blocks of the ballpark is two four million greater now than in one nine nine five but harris county tax assessorcollector paul bettencourt said those figures are due in part to the boom in land values across downtown including the central business district since one nine nine five bettencourt said he hoped to have an analysis finished today to determine whether land values around enron field had increased at a greater rate than land in the rest of downtown the boosters also highlighted more than seven zero zero million worth of private developments planned but not yet completed near the ballpark including the nine zero million three seven story ballpark place tower across crawford street from enron field without a doubt if enron field was not there ballpark place would not be there said john holland an executive vice president for the trammel crow co which expects to break ground on the project in early two zero zero one because the arena would be built in an urban core even academics who are skeptical about the economic benefits of sports stadiums agreed that spinoff development is likely nearby but independent economists who have studied such issues including brad humphreys an assistant professor at the university of marylandbaltimore county say development near a stadium usually has a negative impact on development and businesses in other parts of a city the focus must be on the entire market humphreys said not just in the vicinity of a sports facility public subsidization of stadiums and arenas isnt necessarily a bad thing he said but when they sell them as economic engines its just absolutely wrong the research doesnt show that a recent study humphreys coauthored which appeared in the fall one nine nine nine issue of the journal of policy analysis and management found that the presence of professional sports teams in a market on average actually reduced the percapita income in those markets compared with similar markets without such teams given houstons strong economy eury said he does not believe downtown development will detract from other areas of the city as humphreys studies have shown in other markets a third major economic benefit offered thursday was that a new arena with the houston rockets and houston comets as tenants would generate one three million a year in sales tax revenues about two seven million of that would go into local coffers with the remainder going to the state according to the study performed for eurys group by csl international a consulting firm yet even in the absence of a new arena and both teams many economists say a large portion of those expenditures would be spent in the area anyway that is known as a substitution effect instead of a family going to a game it might go to the movies or local zoo and corporations are likely to sponsor other local events out of their advertising budgets the economists say the csl study did not account for this substitution effect in

zero zero zero dow jones energy service copyright c two zero zero zero dow jones company inc of dow jones newswires los angeles dow jones californias summer of soaring wholesale electricity prices helped boost the stock price of many energy companies in the third quarter but if us rep bob filner dcalif gets his way those companies will be forced to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars in profit to utilities customers and the government filner introduced a bill in the house of representatives last week that would impose a windfall profit tax on wholesale power sold throughout the western us the bill which was referred to the house committee on ways and means may be discussed in december or january according to filner and if he gets enough support by the mostly republican caucus companies like enron corp ene duke energy north america duk southern co so reliant energy rei and dynegy dyn would only be allowed to show a certain amount of profit and anything over that amount would be taxed one zero zero filner said the amount of profit hasnt been determined but his bill calls for a baseline that would be a just and reasonable amount of profit the congressmans san diego constituents were paying marketbased electricity rates in the summer which resulted in tripledigit utility bills he said generators are gouging california customers and need to be held responsible this is not just a problem of supply and demand filner told dow jones newswires this is stealing and we want our money back state and federal regulators are conducting separate investigations into californias wholesale power crisis the findings expected to be complete in about two weeks are aimed at determining if generators or other key players manipulated the states wholesale energy market at least two major energy companies are being investigated by california attorney general bill lockyer a high level source working on the probe with the attorney general said thirdquarter earnings statements will play a major role in finding out if generators manipulated the market their investigation isnt turning up much evidence but earnings statements are showing that profits are up significantly largely due to wholesale prices in california the source said at least one federal energy regulatory commissioner who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the wholesale electricity market in california will be in for a rude awakening when the agency completes its investigation there will be some serious structural changes to the market the commissioner said representatives from energy companies told dow jones newswires that higher profits werent the result of illegal activity or manipulating the market energy cos say summer crisis boosted three q earnings on wednesday duke energy which owns and operates power plants in california said in an earnings statement that thirdquarter profit rose seven four due in part to high wholesale prices in california in the summer enron and several other companies reported similar thirdquarter increases based on californias summer of skyrocketing power prices the congressman doesnt want to limit the proposed windfall tax to california but where generators sell power in the western us but even filner admits that forcing generators to refund part of their profits isnt getting the early support it needs to become law if the democrats were in charge id have this bill voted on already filner said filner said if the bill is passed some of the money would be refunded to consumers and utilities the victims as he refers to them meanwhile hes also working on getting the house to pass a separate bill to roll back electricity rates in the western us to prederegulation levels and hes trying to gather support for a wind power initiative regardless of the outcome the congressman is dead set on making noise if nothing happens im thinking about holding a press conference with the san diego district

slightly to eight five million in the third quarter portland general we reported an ibit loss of one seven million this quarter compared to ibit of seven four million a year ago this loss is due to power contracts pge entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter last week we announced an agreement to sell pge to northwest natural this transaction is expected to close next year global assets this segment includes elektro dabhol tgs azurix and enron wind third quarter ibit remained unchanged at one nine million compared to last year broadband services ibit losses were eight zero million in the current quarter compared to a two zero million loss last year this quarters results include significantly lower investmentrelated income and lower operating costs corporate and other this segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions this segment reported an ibit loss of five nine million compared to one zero six million a year ago in addition this quarter we announced onetime charges of one zero one billion over the past few quarters we have conducted a thorough review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core businesses these charges include a two eight seven million writedown of azurix corp one eight three million associated with the restructuring of broadband services this includes severance costs a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers and a writedown of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers five four four million related to losses from certain investments primarily enrons interest in the new power company broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement with our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things one we showed

dow jones interactive october one two two zero zero one pges real estate rumors i sure hate to kick a bankrupt utility when its down but what are all these rumors floating around the commercial real estate world that pacific gas and electric co is quietly very quietly placing its downtown san francisco headquarters up for sale sources tell me that pge is looking to unload more than one zero zero pieces of property throughout northern california and the crown jewel of the offering is the utilitys headquarters building which it would then lease back under a longterm contract however pge is trying to keep the sales below the radar by going through investment banking channels rather than listing most of the properties outright sources say id bet theyre trying to not spook the market and get people even more worried about their situation one broker said a spokesman for the utility insisted that there are no current plans to sell the headquarters but refused to say categorically that pge isnt pondering the idea as for other properties that may be on the block the utility hasnt updated its online portfolio of surplus assets in months so its impossible to say what may or may not be up for grabs still the rumored plan for the headquarters is for pge to sell off either one or both of its main headquarters buildings at market and beale streets in the financial district and then lease the property back from the new owner pge already leases part of its headquarters from shorenstein co for about two three three zero zero zero a month likely buyers for the other utility buildings would include shorenstein and sam zells equity office properties which became a serious player in the bay area after merging with spieker properties although pge does not publicly discuss its real estate assets internal utility documents recently placed the value of the downtown headquarters at about four five zero million before commercial office prices went into a tailspin this wouldnt make a huge dent in the roughly one three billion pge owes its creditors but hey every little bit helps collateral damage business hasnt improved at the former afghan treasures shop on market

lot if you ask me generators have no plans to change pwr deals with calif los angeles dow jones some of california s largest power generators said they havent been approached by state officials to discuss the possibility of renegotiating four three billion in longterm power pacts the state entered into last spring and executives with the companies indicated they would unlikely be willing to restructure the deals the california public utilities commission has urged the administration of gov gray davis to renegotiate the deals saying the contracts will saddle ratepayers with expensive power for the next one five years in addition puc president loretta lynch said the commission wont pass a rate agreement needed to sell one two five billion in bonds to pay for the power contracts until the deals are renegotiated the rate agreement between the puc and the state department of water resources will ensure there is enough of a revenue stream in the current rate structure to pay off the bonds barry goode legal adviser to gov davis said last week the state has no intention of opening up talks with generators to restructure the contracts the puc filed a complaint with the federal energy regulatory commission the agency that oversees the wholesale price of power saying the price of electricity in the contracts which average about seven nine a megawatthour for the first five years are not just and reasonable all of the energy companies have defended the contracts saying the prices were based on natural gas futures and the market price for wholesale electricity however the price for power sharply declined shortly after the contracts were signed for which davis and calpine corp cpn senior vice president of power marketing jim macias credit the deals calpine a san josebased company which holds the bulk of the four three billion in longterm pacts hasnt been asked to restructure the contracts macias said he said many of the contracts are tied to the construction of new power plants and if the deals were changed the company could lose its financing and the facilities wouldnt get built we dont think our contracts will be renegotiated macias said its very difficult to see even how this would be renegotiated we made a commitment to deliver the power and the state made a commitment to pay for it if either party fails to perform there is a provision in the contract that says you have to make the other party whole macias said it wasnt impossible to restructure the contracts but that it would be very difficult to unwind the position other suppliers say financing tied to longterm deals tom murnane a spokesman for sempra energy resources a unit of sempra energy sre also signed a multibillion longterm contract with the state he too said the company hasnt been approached by state officials to renegotiate the contracts were building a fleet of power plants based on these contracts said murnane in order to secure lending we had to show banks that we had this deal would the state allow us to renegotiate if power prices increase the only legal recourse for renegotiation murnane said would be if both parties agreed to change the terms of the contracts but then where do you stop murnane said steve stengel a spokesman for dynegy inc dyn said the company has no obligation to renegotiate the longterm deal his company signed with california just because the price for power has declined recently we have a legally binding agreement and therefore we dont have any obligation to renegotiate the contract stengel said however we could choose to if it was mutually beneficial to both parties a spokeswoman for the ferc said the puc complaint has been received but the agency wouldnt comment further macias said the puc would have a very difficult challenge convincing ferc that these contracts were not reasonably priced when the were entered into its a high hurdle to demonstrate that ferc needs to step in and void these contracts especially if the people who entered into them believe these contracts helped stabilize the market macias said distributive generation helps providers transmitters distributors consumers with cost reduction and reliability in an advisory by industrialinfocom houstonbusiness wireoct one two two zero zero one the following is an advisory by industrialinfocom industrial information resources inc houston texas distributive generation is the use of small electric generators used to help meet peak power demands during times of high usage on the electrical grid these small generators are found in many varied sources including fuel cells batteries turbinegenerators combustion wind waste heat steam micro and reciprocating enginegenerators consumers as well as those who provide transmit and distribute electricity have found that having these small generators in key areas can help when there is a shortage or other problem with the grid many government and service organizations such as police fire and hospitals and large energy consumers such as factories mills and plants have had emergency generation for a long time with electrical deregulation here and the spot market having such high peaks others have found it cheaper and more convenient as well several utilities throughout the midwest and western states have taken to renting or purchasing many small generators two zero five zero or more and installing them at substations and at major customers sites to prevent problems during electrical shortages and outages as consumers become more and more reliant on automation and computers the need for reliable power will increase and the need for distributive power will continue to grow as well the day may come when distributive power could account for as much as five of all power

are falling short of market and creditor expectations bankruptcy appears increasingly likely but the dynamics of a chone one proceeding remain unclear socal edison is likely to be the first in chone one following its suspended payments to creditors yesterday and is now in a three zero day cure period attempts to bring in the assets of the parent companies are unlikely to succeed bankruptcy would provide davis with some political cover to implement the tough decisions that he has so far avoided on the questions of rate hikes and other costs to taxpayers connected to the proposed operations of the california power authority one legislation passes assembly but generators and consumers remain unhappy the first legislation ab one x passed the california general assembly last night but both generators and consumers are unhappy with the terms generators object to the five five cent per kwh price in the proposed longterm contract while consumer groups such as the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights object to the state acting as a purchaser of power the legislation is expected to pass the senate today and to be signed by governor davis as early as tonight press and source reporting this morning confirms that the principal financial creditors and utility analysts are also unimpressed with the bill which is viewed as insubstantial and falling short of creating a solution to the financial pressures on the utilities two financial institutions exposure to california utilities bank of america two one five million jp morgan two zero two million there is a total of one two billion in outstanding loans but much of this arranged by societe general is to the parents national energy group and edison international the four one seven million mentioned above is the most immediate concern the southern california edison loans are subject to immediate repayment in the aftermath of yesterdays rating downgrade to junk status the fed will not be involved except in a routine way as a bank regulator making sure that the appropriate risk reserves are made against the utilities loans and securities there is no moral hazard here because the fed is not going to guarantee any of the utilities credits which by the way they do not have the authority to do three pgenational energy group shielding assets despite considerable anger at pge for reorganizing to shield its profitable assets from its debtplagued utility business it would seem that davis has little authority to intervene the question of fraudulent conveyance which is a term in bankruptcy law for transferring assets to favored parties not long before a filing which transfer can then be reversed by the court would not seem to apply here since pge went through a regulatory process before ferc to seek approval for the reorganization on friday while courts are reluctant to overturn regulatory agencies impaired creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding could attempt an appeal four involuntary bankruptcy which creditor moves first as for who is likely to move first it is typically the smaller creditors or those who wont receive a good price on postpetition business in this situation our source does not know who that would be but believes it is more likely that the utilities will file a voluntary petition before one of their major creditors files an involuntary petition if dynergy files a petition with a federal bankruptcy court today the debtor utilities can delay the process for weeks if they choose to particularly since there is no allegation of fraud or criminal misappropriation of assets in bankruptcy proceedings which is what is going on here this sort of talk by a creditor such as dynegy is just the usual polite conversational opener akin to comments about the weather or inquiries about ones familys health five edison teetering on the brink moves into three zero day cure period yesterday southern california edison temporarily suspended a two three zero million bond principal and interest payments as well as one five one million to suppliers of renewable power and two one five million due to the california px both utilities are under severe shortterm debt pressure but edison is in the worst position edison due thursday dynegy note dynegy has threaten to take take edison into bankruptcy court if they default pge current available five zero zero m in cash and reserves due feb one st five eight zero m to iso one five th four three one m to california power exchange contrary to press reports and leaks from the governors office yesterday about political brinksmanship edison is clearly not playing negotiating games and is really short of cash in this situation it is unlikely that its executives will be making fraudulent statements the bonds on which they failed to pay would have a three zero day cure period after that the trustees will move on edison if edison has not already filed they have three ways of financing power purchases going forward one the state continues to buy power and sell edison and pge power on a shortterm basis under existing authority or two pending the passage of todays legislation the state legislature authorizes the purchase of power through longterm contracts under the proposed borrowing authority or three edison files for reorganization under chapter one one and obtains almost immediately superpriority postpetition lines of credit secured against its unmortgaged assets which it uses to pay for power until the puc and the rest of the state government recognize that rates have to increase six new hampshire experience a guide for davis following the bankruptcy of the public service company of new hampshire the bankruptcy judge was authorized by a higher court to mandate rate hikes the prospect of imposed rate hikes from the bankruptcy court caused the state government to subsequently determine that rate hikes to consumers were unavoidable passing a seven year rate hike of seven five percent for davis a similar scenario would provide him with some political cover if he were forced by the bankruptcy court to pass through rate hikes as part of a settlement,00:40:00

portfolio valuation and any material threshold to be specified movements to be reported to risk management for consideration of rerun four it operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors to be reported to technical support in the event of a failure the benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time for completion of the rerun of the valuation systems

market environment from houston and consequently use european data can improve our ability to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening james and i will be working with brian hudson to determine the timetable for effecting this change the revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver completed results by the time the risk management team arrive at their desks in the morning system failures are the most significant problem we face in delivering timely information to houston consequently the probability of meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we will have full it overnight support covering for any it failure and curve input

zero one ca gas reporting order sparks rehearing requests while many marketers are complaining to ferc that its drastic order imposing reporting requirements on natural gas sales to california market is not needed or oversteps its jurisdiction state utilities and regulators would like to see the order expanded and the results shared the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued the july two five order in an attempt to understand why natural gas prices rose considerably more in california when compared to the rest of the country see daily gpi july two six the adopted gas sales reporting requirements will cover gas sellers local distribution companies ldc and transporters serving the california market in its ruling ferc said it plans to collect the data on a quarterly basis three zero days after the end of a quarter in a standardized format and then aggregate it to assess whether any action is warranted with respect to the gas prices in the state two of the petitioners enron north america and enron energy services said among other things in their request for a rehearing that the price anomaly of last winter was a transitory problem with solutions already in sight at least at the federal level the companies added that prices are continuing to fall over time and thus there is no reason for the commission to require the permanent reporting rules that were included in the order the enron companies said they support the continuation of ad hoc reports that the commission already has requested from certain parties they said that while they prefer the reports more than the reporting requirements that contain no sunset date they believe that the formalized adoption of these reports is not appropriate for the situation imposes undue burden on affected companies and in light of market changes is no longer justified eprime inc a gas marketing subsidiary of xcel energy and tractebel energy marketing inc temi also filed motions for rehearing based upon claims that they do not fall under the commissions natural gas act nga jurisdiction temi claims that although it is a marketer of natural gas and electricity the commission has erred in ordering that the reporting requirement may apply to companies that are not jurisdictional for purposes of the nga and related statutes temi further stated in its request that if the commission continues to find that the gas reporting requirement may be applied to such companies it should have refrained from doing so with respect to entities whose volumes of gas sales are clearly not material to the commissions core inquiry eprimes request stated that neither section one four nor section one six of the nga empowers ferc to require nonjurisdictional companies to report the commission has no authority to compel nonjurisdictional entities to report any information regarding nonjurisdictional transactions to the commission eprime stated in its request eprime said the commission noted that its jurisdiction to regulate prices charged by natural gas sellers is limited to sales for resale of domestic gas by pipelines ldcs or their affiliates furthermore the marketer said that the information demanded by ferc is highly confidential with sensitive marketing information which even with regards to jurisdictional entities cannot be required eprime said to do so could jeopardize the potential release of sensitive trading information which serves no useful regulatory purpose not every company was seeking to have the order tamed however southern california gas co san diego gas electric co collectively sempra utilities and the california public utilities commission all would like it expanded the sempra utilities filed a request of limited clarification with the commission regarding the orders scope the utilities requested that the commission clarify that it intends for interstate pipelines serving california to provide data on capacity utilization by shippers east and north upstream of california in addition to data regarding capacity utilization by shippers directly serving the state the request for clarification requests that upstream entities such as ldcs and utilities also be included in the reporting requirements the sempra utilities stated that since activity upstream of california affects deliveries to and prices at the california border it is essential that the commission obtain the same data from these entities as it would for california ldcs utilities and marketing affiliates absent this information it is impossible for the commission to gain a comprehensive understanding of the pricing disparity between california and the rest of the nation in the cpucs request for a rehearing and clarification it is requesting again that the commission share the information with the cpuc the cpuc argued that information explaining how the exceptionally high california border price of gas in two zero zero zero and two zero zero one occurred could aid the state in understanding how it happened and how to spot the indicators in the future the organization said it would maintain the confidentiality of any sensitive material under the fercs rules as it does under its own rules for confidential information,09:13:30

million and the direct access charge backs for negative px credits increased two one million now totaling two five millionzero one sces total default amount is now one seven billio n excluding amounts yet to be collected from sce customers for dwr purchases there is little question that the qfs are taking it on the chin big time in the last five weeks between january three one and march eight the defaulted payments to the qf owners from both utilities has increased six three zero million the total qf default for both utilities as of march eight stands at one five billionzero one does anyone wonder why one five zero zero mw of qf capacity has shut down in californiazero one without these payments being made very soon i would expect the amount of shut down qf capacity to easily double or morezero one why woul d these projects produce without the promise of being paid things in the peoples republic of california zero one be a source for energy price update art odonnell editor and associate publisher of the wellknown and widely read california energy market cem is looking for traders willing to participate in his survey in exchange for receiving an advanced copyzero one t he survey is a regular feature in cem the information collected by art is matched against the responses of the other people he interviews and some posted sources pricewaterhouse coopers bpas daily offerings for instancezero one it is written up in narrative form the report goes out twic e weekly once on wednesday afternoonevening via email as a courtesy to the respondents because the week is pretty much done by then and a rewrite on friday that is emailed around one zero am posted on the newsdatacom web site and published in the newsletter for general consumption the friday report also features a brief story about natural gas markets in the west the wptf board of directors has allowed me to publicize this offering and to explain that if your company is interested in participating the information you provide to art would be protected as confidentialzero one in arts words the price survey is unlike some attempts at creating a tradable index number eg mcgrawhills power markets week index or the dow jones indices is more of a narrative about the state of the market d a pulse reading as opposed to a blood pressure number or an ekg as such i do not ask traders and schedulers for precise dollar figures or volumes associated with specific trades but rather questions like whats midcolumbia going for today what about offpeak how has that changed since this morning oh yeah why is that anything else i should know the wptf board asked art to explain how the information he collects would be protected since so many marketers and generators are under state data subpoenaszero one art replied the constitution of the state of california provides for a blanket immunity against government intrusions for news gathering from confidential sources and unpublished information something which we believe in strongly at energy newsdata corporation and which we are willing to go to jail to protect so if for instance the attorney general tried to subpoena me or anyone from my staff about power price information we would one refuse to divulge anything other than the already published accounts two send back a copy of the constitution three contact the attorneys for the society of professional journalists and four start preparing a benefit party to raise legal fees if you would like to participate in arts survey please email him at aodnewsdatacom things in the peoples republic of california zero one bpa misquoted in the wsj in last weeks burrito i referred to a wall street journal article that portrayed a bpa trader as admonishing the dwr for accepting bids over market priceszero one i was surprised when i received the following email fro m bpas david millszero one his message to me copied a letter he sent to dwrs r ay hart explaining what he meant as opposed to what he was quoted as saying dear ray as per our telephone discussion i just wanted to reiterate a few things rethe wall street journal article and the quotes attributed to mezero one at no time during the interview with ms smith did i state that i thought that cdwrs offers were out of line with the prevailing market price in california or that your traders should check that price before entering the marketzero one the reporter was quite interested in the price difference betwe en california and the midc price here in the northwest and when i asked i told her that currently that price delta was roughly five zero one zero zero mwhr with midc being lower than the ca priceszero one i did not indicate to the reporter that i thought that cdwr was paying more than the california market price and was simply trying to make a comparison of price relativity between california and the northwestzero one lastly bpa has on occasion charged extraregional entities less than the prevailing market price but has only done so to remain consistent with our own pricing strategies zero one i apologize for any misconceptions or miscommunications that may have resulted from this and look forward to a continuing working relationship between cdwr and bpa things ferc zero one market monitoring proposal ferc staff issued a report with recommendations on prospective market monitoring and mitigation for the california wholesale electric power marketzero one wptf members are taking this proposal very seriously and we intend to provide comments on march two two zero one if you are

operating variable costzero one furthe r excluding measures of credit worthiness are an important missing variable in the ferc analysiszero one next week i will include a short summary of our response in the burrito letters i received a note from one of our legal beagles that drop me a line every now and thenzero one i dont have the facts of the case to which this person refers but i hope the sender provides us with an update if a judgement should occur universal studios wants ferc to find that universal owes no penalty to sce for not interrupting its interruptible load under a cpuc rate schedule because sce did not adhere to the ferc requirement in the dec one five order to schedule nine five of its load in the day ahead market according to universal if sce had done so then it would have had to provide universal power at below its costzero one sce didnt and universal go t interrupted and now universal owes zero one does anyone else kno w about this filing lind guerry veteran of

wwwscientechcom image image april two zero two zero zero one deal for sces transmission assets appears dead on arrival by will mcnamara director electric industry analysis news item from reuters california gov gray davis billion dollar plan to save utility southern california edison sce from bankruptcy is in deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators legislative sources said the governor was having so much trouble gathering support for his plan that he could not find anyone to sponsor a bill one assembly official called the sce bailout plan the most unpopular piece of legislation in years analysis even when this deal was announced as an agreement in principle some five zero days ago it seemed too farfetched to be possible the only party that clearly seems to benefit from the agreement forged between gov davis and sce is the cashstrapped utility california energy customers appear to get the short end of an expensive stick while the state seemingly gains nothing of value beyond what could amount to a whole new set of administrative problems thus despite the hype with which gov davis announced this rescue plan for sce california legislatorsboth republicans and democratsare saying not so fast and appear to be collectively opposed to the plan as it currently stands as it becomes apparent that the california legislature will not approve this plan the general consensus is that gov davis offer to sce is simply a financial bailout for the utility that provides no benefit to california residents for background on the details of gov davis rescue plan for sce please reference my issuealert from four one one zero one in a nutshell the state of california agreed to buy sces one two zero zero zero mile transmission grid which covers much of the southern half of the state for two seven six billion two three times the systems book value sce would be allowed to use the proceeds to pay off its existing debt restoring it to financial stability both the california legislature and the cpuc need to approve this deal by aug one five or else the agreement is terminated in the highly politicized climate under which the california energy crisis has unfolded it is imperative to understand the agendas that each stakeholder possesses for instance keep in mind that gov davis political career has been severely damaged by the states energy crisis and the fact that pacific gas electric co californias largest utility company declared bankruptcy has only further tainted the governors standing perhaps more than any other goal davis wants to keep sce from also filing for chapter one one protection in addition davis believes he will be better able to solve the crisis if he assumes control over the states transmission grid much like the state has assumed the role of a power purchasing agent normally a measure supported by the democratic governor could be easily approved by californias democratcontrolled legislature however the energy issue has divided support for davis even within his own party consequently the governor needs the support of both republicans and democrats in order to see his rescue plan for sce pass for its part there was very little reason why sce should not have agreed to the governors terms from multiple standpoints the utility gains enormously from the governors offer while at the same time it avoids lengthy and costly bankruptcy proceedings under the agreement sce gains a method for pulling itself out of debt via rate increases that probably would be implemented over the next one five years further its parent company edison international gets to hold on to a reported four eight billion that sce has provided to the corporate operation since one nine nine seven the exception to this is a four zero zero million tax refund that edison international would give back to sce while davis referred to his plan as a good balanced deal some consumer groups have charged that sce has taken the governor to the cleaners meanwhile california customers clearly lose in the deal because they would be forced to ultimately pay for the two seven six billion that the state needs to buy the transmission assets the state would purchase the lines with bonds that would be paid off by transmission fees charged to sce customers it is presently not clear whether or not those fees which are already part of monthly bills would be sufficient therefore it is likely that rates would be increased to support the purchase in addition the subtext of the deal is that customers would ultimately pay to drive down sces debt which was accumulated as a result of unrestricted wholesale power costs charged by generators consequently california customers would bear the responsibility for prices that ferc has at times deemed unjust and unreasonable ultimately however it is the california legislature and cpuc that will have the authority to approve the agreement between gov davis and sce these two agencies must ultimately decide if the plan is good or bad and weigh the impact for various stakeholders presently the legislature in particular is finding that there are many questionable aspects about the plan for instance what value would there be in the california government owning only one portion of the states interconnected transmission system pgocorp has walked away from the negotiating table and has expressed little interest in selling its transmission lines to the state no agreement with sempra energy parent of san diego gas electric has been reached either thus if the gov davis sce agreement is approved the state of california would gain ownership rights to only a portion of the overall transmission system in the state many legislators challenge the value of this especially when it is considered that most of the congestion that leads to higher prices within the state is concentrated along pges portion of the grid the counterargument to this point is that now that its utility is in bankruptcy proceedings pgomay not have the choice of whether or not to sell its transmission assets to the state the bankruptcy judge would make this decision thus some argue the state may have a better chance of obtaining pges transmission assets if it can first complete a deal with sce the second fundamental problem is that causing california legislators to turn their back on the governors plan is what some have referred to as an obscene bailout for sce and its parent company some reportedly believe that gov davis rushed into an overly generous offer for sce out of anxiety caused by the breakdown in his communications with pge as noted the two seven six billion offer for sces assets is about two three times their book value so many legislators are having difficulty reconciling what appears to be an inappropriate price tag and once again a cost that taxpayers and ratepayers would ultimately have to absorb currently sce customers pay a fercapproved transmission rate based upon a costplus formula if the state pays two three times book value it would equate to ratepayers paying two times over for those same transmission lines in addition some legislators including former democratic allies of gov davis have suggested that sce should be forced to enter bankruptcy as pacific gas electric co has done naturally legislators will approach the issue with their constituents in mind knowing that they will be accountable for how they vote on this plan looking at the issue from a customer perspective one could argue that sce declaring bankruptcy would create less financial hardship for california customers than bailing out the utility and increasing rates this will be a major political challenge for california legislators to resolve if the governors plan becomes sponsored as a bill if i pull out my crystal ball and be so bold as to make projections in this case i would predict that there is little chance that gov davis rescue plan for sce will pass in its current form the energy crisis in california has become so politicized that legislators will be very reticent to approve any measure that resembles a financial bailout for one of the utilities especially without obtaining something of value for the state in return it is gov davis personal agenda to obtain control over the states transmission assets but i dont see this as being a priority for other california lawmakers thus the deal will be a tough sell unless some new development occurs that puts owning sces transmission assets in the states best interest considering the many headaches associated with this business and the fact that the state has no expertise in this area i dont see this occurring consequently the game is by no means over for sce and its potential for bankruptcy does not appear to have decreased to any large extent one large california utility is already in bankruptcy court we could be only days or weeks away from seeing sce head in that direction

training for users more experience in overall information retrieval editing of some reports our security process and the difficulty of getting information from various and sundry databases since sap is interfaced to get the full picture we have passed all these items on to the appropriate solution mgr so that they can specifically address them as i think i mentioned several months ago we had complaints about nonresponsiveness calls not being returned being passed around alot etc hopefully weve turned the corner there please let me know if there are other areas youd like us to address as

thanks stephen were trying to work out how certain allocations from corp are applied within enron europe currently the allocations in question are being applied to regulatory affairs europe ra i received a message from greg mcmahon regarding the environment and the environmental policy and compliance cost centers distribution to ra but also would like to address the issue of the allocation from my cost center managing dir govt affairs to ra i think all of these cost allocations should be at the enron europe level as a company rather than distributed to the ra group regarding the environmental groups allocations these activities are on behalf of the business units activities not on behalf of ra at least part of the activities are global in nature and not even attributable to specific regions or countries within europe regarding the mng dir govt affairs allocation these costs reflect a portion of the activity in our dc office with federal legislators and agencies again on behalf of the business units activities not on behalf of ra another issue with the distribution of these costs to ra is the circle created when you allocate to a budget that then gets allocated please

bob would be able to resolve it or want to get involved can you please ask rick to forward it to stephen and hell resolve it we have our reg affairs budget meeting with michael brown next week and he is sure to have some views on it stephen the issue is that the corp allocations reg affairs are getting are for ehs work and general rather than specifically attributable to reg affairs its one one

corporate allocations plan two zero zero two greg aside from the justification of the ehs allocations to europe the larger question is where those charges should be applied rick and i spoke yesterday about this and we agreed that the ehs charges as well as the small amount of corp govt affairs thats allocated to europe are more appropriately applied at the business unit level as its not the regulatory affairs group that actually receives the services additionally the regulatory affairs europe charges are applied back to the business unit anyway so its rather like burying allocations within another allocation ive left a message for mark lindsey in the corp finance group to find out who we need to talk to in europe about this issue if you have any suggestion as to who would be best to talk to about this id appreciate that as well in the meantime well be sure to update the allocation explanations for the two ehs departments concerned thanks elizabeth original message from mcmahon

charges are valid or can be reducedremoved alan i have copied you in as paul mentioned you were the most appropriate ehs person and if reg affairs dont take the charges perhaps your department asset management can these are the ehs charges reg affairs are down to take at the moment from the spreadsheet i could work out that we are paying for one zero environment and four of policy and compliance

taxpayers could foot the bill san diego union two two three small electric producers ok big price cut power line plan has new foes la cresta residents vow to keep electricity equipment out of the cleveland forest and a wilderness area by thomas buckley the pressenterprise lake elsinore a new group has raised its objections to lake elsinores proposed hydroelectric plant and the power lines that might carry its electricity to san diego county on thursday the elsinore valley municipal water district board set aside for further study later this month a motion by director gary kelley to ensure that both the lines and the actual power plant that make up a four five zero million proposal from enron north america proceed together but residents of la cresta a mountaintop community near where the lines might run did not care whether the plant and lines happened together many of them do not want the lines to be there at all we are resolved to keep power lines out of the cleveland national forest and the san mateo wilderness area said la cresta resident bill stockmar our constituents and the local residents impacted by the proposed project are outraged and respectfully demand immediate intervention to stop this project at the planning level as it stands now the power lines from the hydroelectric plant would run from temescal canyon to camp pendleton along the ridge line of the elsinore mountains just west of the lake those lines could run in a narrow strip of forest land just west of the la cresta community enron project manager rob bakondy said the final determination of where the lines might run is not set but he said the power lines could be built at least a year before the plant itself besides serving the hydroelectric plant the power lines could be used to replace lines san diego gas and electric wants to build through murrieta and temecula to bring power to san diego the water district also announced it is considering financing and building the lines itself district general manager john rossi said wednesday that it was too early to say exactly how the lines would be built but that the districts building or owning the lines or both in cooperation with enron is one possibility board president kris anderson said it is too early to tell whether it would benefit the district to become so directly involved in the project but he said the district would be able to borrow the approximately five zero million needed to build the lines at a lower interest rate than a private company could get that difference anderson said could mean extra dollars for the district how governor davis proposal to purchase thousands of miles of transmission lines from the ailing utilities will affect the project is not yet clear said enron spokeswoman kathy russeth the timing of the construction of the project if it is approved by state and federal regulators will not be finally known until a contract between enron and the water district has been agreed upon that is expected to happen by the end of may gop in a fix over power crisis leaders seek solutions that wont undercut past support for deregulation by daniel borenstein times political editor california republican party leaders are trying desperately to politicize the states electricity crisis by blaming gray davis but it seems that the harder they try the more popular the democratic governor becomes the latest gop push will come today when party leaders meeting in sacramento for the start of their threeday state convention hold a hastily organized workshop on energy we should be explaining to california that gray davis was asleep at the switch last year said one of the scheduled speakers republican strategist dan schnur but that message can only work if its coupled with a proposal for an alternative solution so far that hasnt happened for all the complaints about davis republicans are moving even slower looking to two zero zero two when davis will stand for reelection the gop has run radio ads attacking the governor for delays but the party has yet to distinguish itself with a solid plan of its own if republicans are able in the next couple of months to articulate a clear plan which is different from the democratic plan yes we can use it as a political message said stuart deveaux spokesman for the california republican party are republicans in sacramento going to come up with a plan that articulates a future for our energy problem im not telling you its going to be revealed this weekend its my hope it will be articulated this weekend republicans are caught in an ideological quagmire pushing for reregulation of electricity conflicts with the partys basic tenet of less government interference conversely arguing for full deregulation puts republicans at odds with a solid majority of californians a los angeles times poll taken feb one four one five found that six zero percent of californians want to go back to a regulated electricity industry while two five percent are opposed the gop problem is exacerbated because there is no easy policy solution to the energy mess said jack pitney government professor at claremont mckenna college its difficult to see how we get out of this situation without considerable cost if there were a silver bullet somebody would have found it by now republicans have attacked davis for his plan to buy power lines from private utilities everybody agrees theres one billion or two billion in deferred maintenance said gop consultant sal russo another speaker at the partys convention today we need to be in this business like a hole in the head but the times poll found that californians by a five two three six margin favor the idea moreover davis job approval rating has climbed this year in january four nine percent approved and two five percent disapproved in february it was up to five seven two six californians give davis better marks for handling the electricity crisis than they give president bush republicans are going to have difficult time laying the political blame on davis its murder on the orient express everybody did it pitney said although you can make a case that davis was slow in reacting no one can seriously pin him with the primary blame for the problem the deregulation bill passed the legislature in one nine nine six with the strong support of both parties and a republican governor pete wilson senate minority leader jim brulte rrancho cucamonga is considered one of the republican partys top strategists he was also one of the leading proponents of the deregulation bill for all of those reasons garry south davis political strategist said he does not fear a gop attack on electricity if the republicans want to get into a fullout firefight over how this mess came about im more than willing to play they dont have a very good story to tell for now davis political strength is stable but the two zero zero two primary elections are still more than a year away and the general election is a political eternity from now if this isnt resolved there is nothing to guarantee that there wont be a voter backlash against the government said political analyst sherry bebitch jeffe and right now the government in california is the democratic party thats the message the republicans want to drive home but if they cant come up with their own alternative they might have a hard time playing the blame game davis says state has tentative deal for edison grid updated feb two three two zero zero one four four two pm los angeles after a week of intense closeddoor negotiations with utility representatives gov gray davis said friday he had reached an agreement in principle with southern california edison to buy the utilitys power lines for an estimated two seven billion the deal also requires edison international the parent company of edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade this is the framework of a good balanced deal davis said its not a final deal theres a lot of work to be done but were making progress the governor said he did not expect customer rates to increase as a result of the deal edison did not immediately return calls seeking comment the state has been in talks for a week to buy a total of two six zero zero zero miles of transmission lines from edison pacific gas and electric and sempra energy which operates san diego gas electric the total cost of the lines could range from four five billion to seven billion the effort is intended to help restore the financial health of the states two largest utilities pge and edison both of which are near bankruptcy the two seven billion price for the edison lines amounts to two three times the estimated book value davis said the utilities say they have lost nearly one three billion since june trapped between soaring wholesale power prices and stateimposed rate caps for consumers the tentative plan announced by davis would allow edison to issue bonds for a substantial portion of its losses davis said the state is making good progress in its talks with sempra and some progress with pge thursday davis said he will not sign off on any grid buyout without all three utilities participation i do not believe we can make a satisfactory arrangement without six zero percent of the transmission grid and that would require cooperation with pge he said friday pge spokesman ron low said thursday night that talks had ended with no resolution that day these are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight low said there are clearly some issues where we are very far apart still pge chief executive officer robert glynn jr said friday the meeting with davis was a milestone in the resolution of californias energy crisis and said he was willing to meet further to discuss the utilitys proposal each utilitys issues and opportunities in this crisis are different and we believe that pge has proposed a detailed solution that balances ratepayer and shareholder interests glynn said in a statement issued friday before the governors news conference the company said it would have no further comment the tentative agreement also calls for edison parent edison international to make payments to the utility of about four two zero million edison international to commit the entire output of its sunrise mission power project at low costbased rates for one zero years davis said that arrangement could save ratepayers five zero zero million over the next two years edison to provide costbased rates from generating plants it owns for another one zero years edison to drop its lawsuit against the california public utilities commission claiming that imposed rate caps were illegal under federal law this entire transaction which i believe is fair and balanced for both sides will be accomplished within the existing rate structure davis said we will not be asking any more of consumers to allow this transaction to come to pass davis said negotiations will continue in the coming days consumer advocate harvey rosenfield called the governors plan an outrageous giveaway and predicted that if lawmakers didnt halt it voters would revolt the most outrageous part of this isnt even paying two three times what the lines are worth but then allowing the parent companies that siphoned off billions of dollars to pay only the tax payment they already owe rosenfield said the public utilities commission already regulates how much the utilities can charge for power their own plants generate rosenfield said by leslie gornstein associated press writer utilities search for longterm fix during breather state purchase of power lines under discussion fridayfebruary two three two zero zero one two zero zero one san francisco chronicle sacramento a break in the weather and a break in the energy crisis coincided yesterday as california enjoyed its first day in more than a month without a power alert with the shortterm picture for power improving representatives of the states three troubled utilities met separately with gov gray davis and his staff to work on a longerrange fix for the power crisis that would include state purchase of the firms transmission lines trouble loomed in at least one set of talks however as pacific gas and electric co said it was very far from reaching a deal the california independent system operator which coordinates the flow of electricity through the states power grid removed all power alerts at about nine am yesterday spokeswoman lorie odonley said that with springtime approaching and weather improving and with some power plants coming back to full output from maintenance the overall picture is brightening were optimistic she said were coming into the spring season the majority of generators have had their maintenance completed but everything is dependent on the weather and temperature the last day california had no power alerts was jan one three since then there have been two days of rolling blackouts in northern california and many other days of stage three alerts when power reserves dip below one five percent of available capacity the mildest alert stage one is declared when reserves are between five and seven percent of capacity the supply of power has been helped by warmer temperatures in other western states cutting demand there and by an increase in generators on line in california odonley said last week when the state was still in stage three alerts one zero five zero zero megawatts were offline in california yesterday there were eight two zero zero megawatts offline a difference that provides enough power for a couple million homes odonley warned that the supply picture in california is still tight and conservation still necessary but the focus of attention was turning to sacramento and davis talks with the utilities davis announced a plan last week for the state to purchase two six zero zero zero miles of utilityowned transmission lines in exchange for backing bonds that allow the utilities to repay the almost one three billion in debt they say they owe while southern california edison and san diego gas and electric have indicated willingness to sell their lines pge has refused to comment on the proposal it is not clear if pge is unwilling to sell or simply trying to strike a harder bargain the utility had accumulated more debt than its southern california counterparts and also owns the largest part of the transmission line grid talks between davis staff and pge did not start until late yesterday afternoon and indications were that they were more difficult than negotiations involving the other two utilities theyre just on a different page michael peevey the former edison president who is davis chief negotiator told bloomberg news pge spokesman ron low said these are difficult problems that cannot be solved overnight there are clearly some areas where we are very far apart davis hopes to make an announcement with at least one of the utilities before leaving today for the fourday national governors association meeting in washington dc the union that represents some one one zero zero zero pge employees meanwhile called on davis to negotiate state ownership of two power plants under construction in which pge holds large stakes jack mcnally business manager of the international brotherhood of electrical workers local one two four five in walnut creek told davis in a letter that a transmission line takeover would be a grand experiment fraught with danger acquiring the two prospective power plants in kern and san diego counties would do more to address energy shortages than taking over transmission lines that need hundreds of millions of dollars in maintenance union officials said davis spokesman steve maviglio countered that state acquisition of transmission lines would not affect one union job as the state would simply lease the grid back to the utilities maviglio predicted union jobs would increase with investment in new capacity and system upgrades chronicle staff writers patrick hoge and robert salladay contributed to this report states energy price tag increases published friday feb two three two zero zero one in the san jose mercury news by dion nissenbaum mercury news sacramento bureau sacramento californias energy crisis took another big bite out of the state budget thursday when finance aides to gov gray davis announced that the cost of buying energy may top three billion by midmarch in a move that raised new alarms for lawmakers the governors finance team for the third time this month asked for five zero zero million to buy electricity in the coming weeks while davis tries to work out a deal to bail out the states nearbankrupt utilities that combined with money spent last month to buy energy could drain the state coffers of three billion by st patricks day the request for more cash came on the same day that california spent its first day in weeks without an official energy emergency and davis held critical talks with the heads of pacific gas electric co and san diego gas electric co the talks are aimed at rescuing the two companies and southern california edison from financial collapse while davis had expressed hope last week of working out a deal by today sources said that an agreement still remains elusive until a compromise can be hammered out the state is being forced to pay upward of five zero million a day from the general fund to buy electricity state leaders expect that the money will eventually be repaid to the general fund under a one zero billion bond package but lawmakers are growing increasingly concerned about the shortterm impact on the state fiscal plan assemblywoman carole migden dsan francisco said the latest request for more money could create greater concern and anxiety among lawmakers and added that the energy crisis was going to make it harder to fund other programs such as support for abused children its going to be a bleak year for other budget priorities said migden who is chairwoman of the powerful assembly appropriations committee earlier this week the states independent financial analyst warned that the energy crisis could eat into state money the governor wants to spend on other things such as the environment and public safety while lawmakers have so far bitten their tongues about the growing power price tag migden said the legislature might be hesitant to allow the costs to go any higher i cant imagine another infusion after this being required migden said i think this has to be the last request because were going to hit fundamental core programs waiting for bailout plan california stepped in to buy the energy last month after pge and southern california edison lost the financial wherewithal to do it themselves at the time state leaders reluctantly agreed to buy the energy for a short period of time as part of a larger plan for california to sign longterm contracts with power generators but those negotiations have failed to produce much energy so far and davis said earlier this week that the power producers are hesitant to sign any deals until california agrees to a bailout plan for the utilities on thursday one power producer williams cos announced that it had signed a one zero year contract with the state to provide up to one four zero zero megawatts of power to california in a bid to work out the bailout plan davis and his advisers met thursday and were to meet again today with top executives from all three electric utilities in financial trouble the democratic governor wants to buy two six zero zero zero miles of high voltage transmission lines owned by the three companies in exchange for helping the utilities pay off one three billion in debts the utilities are being asked to protect thousands of acres of wilderness lands they own hang onto power plants that provide the state with its cheapest electricity and drop explosive lawsuits that could allow the companies to dramatically raise customer rates but sources said talks have bogged down on the transmission line deal which pge has been reluctant to accept alternative energy helps out while talks slogged along in the governors office state lawmakers announced that another key piece of the puzzle needed to solve the energy crisis was falling into place state sen jim battin rpalm desert and assemblyman fred keeley dsanta cruz said that alternative energy producers had agreed to dramatically lower their prices in a deal that could save california three billion to four billion those energy producers nearly seven zero zero wind solar and natural gasfired plants provide about a third of the states energy paying for power still a big question power crisis pge doesnt like the plan the puc proposed to collect electricity costs by mike taugher times staff writer three weeks after gov gray davis signed into law the states centerpiece for stabilizing energy costs big differences remain over how the solutions will be implemented and who will pay for them the plan outlined in legislation known as abone x was intended first to stop the financial bleeding of californias two largest utilities by asking the state to buy enough unsecured power to keep the lights on next the state would enter longterm contracts for less expensive power that would eventually lessen the need for more costly lastminute electricity but the state has balked at buying the entire portfolio of lastminute electricity that is needed and a disagreement emerged thursday over what portion of consumers bills should be used to reimburse state coffers meanwhile progress on completing contracts has been slow although two were signed thursday a spokesman for davis said more contracts for relatively lowcost power would be signed once the state bought the utilities transmission lines and other assets because then the utilities could pay their pastdue bills the governor said last week that he expected a deal with the utilities by today but that might not happen clearly theres been challenges getting longterm contracts but weve turned the corner said davis spokesman steve maviglio weve got three in the bank and one zero more once we get these deals with the utilities done also thursday the public utilities commission was poised to allow the state to collect the entire amount that customers pay specifically for electricity but pacific gas electric co said it is entitled to deduct other costs from customers payments before reimbursing the state that would reduce payments from pge to the state by about half according to the company the puc proposal was in response to a request from the state department of water resources that it be allowed to start collecting money so that energy companies would be more willing to sell power to the agency the two republicanappointed commissioners of the puc blocked the move which needed four of five commissioners approval to reach the agenda dwrs action is exacerbating a problem abone x was meant to alleviate said commissioner richard bilas it is pushing the utilities closer to bankruptcy pge spokesman john nelson said the proposal brought by puc president loretta lynch would have been unfair to the utilities because abone x allows them to deduct expenses for buying electricity and generating energy at their own power plants before reimbursing the state all of those costs need to be paid going forward otherwise you still leave the utilities to bleed nelson said that stance appeared to be at odds with the office of assemblyman fred keeley the boulder creek democrat who wrote abone x for pge to think it can keep money for electrons it never even owned is astounding to us said guy phillips a keeley aide while nothing has gone smoothly phillips and others expressed optimism that the states biggest effort to date to fix the energy crisis would work we think those will be sorted out said phillips who acknowledged there has been much confusion about what lawmakers intended in abone x for example keeleys office said lawmakers wanted the water resources agency to make up the entire amount of electricity that the states two largest utilities had not secured ahead of time the high cost of this lastminute electricity and the utilities heavy reliance on it is what drove pge and southern california edison to the brink of bankruptcy but the water agency has balked at buying electricity offered at prices it calls unreasonable while state officials have refused to say how much electricity it has left to utilities to purchase the state is paying about five five million a day to keep electricity flowing and that amounts to about nine zero percent of the electricity purchased on behalf of the utilities on the same day it is needed according to phillips the states reluctance to buy all of the socalled realtime electricity has led to fears that the utilities will continue to run up debt and that power companies will not collect money owed to them that dispute has landed in federal court where a sacramento judge is forcing three major power suppliers and a marketing company to continue selling power in the state if a

lowenthal returns utility money by will shuck from our sacramento bureau sacramento assemblyman alan lowenthal dlong beach this week joined a small group of legislators who returned campaign

california gas it was a small portion of the more than lowenthal five zero zero zero zero zero lowenthal had raised in two zero zero zero for his reelection campaign he said he returned the money as did nine other assembly members at the urging of the consumer advocacy group global exchange we think its fantastic that he has recognized that in the eyes of the public there is a very serious potential conflict of interest said group spokeswoman medea benjamin we applaud him for wanting to ensure the integrity of the legislative process while benjamin says its critical that lawmakers not be tainted by energy money during the states power crisis others wonder where the line should be drawn in the real world of politics it costs money to run for office and you have to get that money somewhere said paul schmidt a political science professor at cal state long beach to say that you can only make decisions on things involving individuals that havent given you any money would result in paralysis of government benjamin and other consumer advocates say the power crisis calls for special consideration there are not many cases in which theyre actually voting whether a company will survive with billions of dollars of taxpayer money or go bankrupt as theyre doing with the utility companies benjamin said lowenthal agreed i thought it was an appropriate request he said these are unique circumstances and i just think its in the publics best interest that i return that money dan walters a power grab by politicians published feb two three two zero zero one slowly but inexorably control over the generation acquisition and distribution of electric power in california is being shifted from professional utility managers and independent regulators into the hands of politicians the one nine nine six utility deregulation scheme enacted by the legislature was an initial foray into politicization legislation granting the governor more control over the makeup of the public utilities commission was another but the current power supplyprice crisis has led to even more direct political influence over or interference with electric service one hastily enacted bill for example gives the governor direct control of the nowmisnamed independent system operator which operates the statewide power grid more political intrusion is in the works from a state takeover of the intercity power transmission grid to the creation of a state power authority that would buy generate and sell electricity directly and while local public utilities function well a state power agency might operate on the whims of professional politicians the legislature for example wants appointments to the board that would direct a state power authority and big state power projects would be subject to the same kind of porkbarrel mentality that distorts other public works appropriations where power plants were to be built or where highvoltage lines would be strung might well depend on who could and could not bring political influence to bear rather than what the system needed to work efficiently clues to the potential pitfalls of a stateoperated power system are found in the approaches of capitol politicians to the current crisis there is for example the unspoken goal of avoiding big power rate boosts until after the november two zero zero two election even if it means running up billions of dollars in debts to do it would future rates charged by a state power authority be raised or lowered to enhance the prospects of the dominant party or an incumbent governor theres no evidence in past performances to indicate they wouldnt be and then theres the knotty question of who would get vital power supplies in the event of shortages a situation that is already looming and could become worse in future months emergency legislation already gives the state the right to sell power as it pleases without competitive bidding or even public notice theres nothing really to prevent politically influential power customers such as big industrial enterprises from cutting their own supply deals with politically directed state officials and whose juice would be cut off if shortages mean blackouts approximately four five percent of current power customers are effectively exempt from rolling blackouts because they are connected to circuits called blocks that also include vital services such as hospitals fire and police agencies water supply systems and communications centers the capitol not surprisingly is in one of those noninterruptible blocks with the threat of further blackouts looming legislation is being drafted to designate which customers will suffer and which will not thus taking that authority out of the hands of utilities and regulators and that in turn is generating pressure from lobbyists from all sorts of interest groups to place their clients on protected lists should farmers be cut off or biotechnology facilities or computer chip plants or schools when politicians control any process or system one can be certain that they will always make expedient political decisions regardless of the longterm or wider consequences thus we may someday regret allowing the capitols selfserving politicians to get their hands on our electric power system discount urged near power plants senator urges electricity rate break for neighbors of generators fridayfebruary two three two zero zero one two zero zero one san francisco chronicle as california officials propose building three two new peaker power plants across the state by july one legislator from plantrich eastern contra costa county thinks residents should get a discount on their power bill for having a generator in their backyard the proposed bill would provide a little payback for residents of state sen tom torlaksons district which is home to a halfdozen plants and has three more in the construction pipeline under the bill introduced yesterday by torlakson dantioch people living within a two zero mile circle around a power plant would receive a two zero percent discount on their electricity bill and be exempt from blackouts the legislation was partially inspired by san jose officials rejecting a proposal to build a six zero zero megawatt power plant in the coyote valley as well as gov gray davis plan to build five zero zero zero megawatts of new generating capacity by july one its a question of fairness torlakson said people in communities who are shouldering the burden for having plants in their backyard should get some benefit from it torlakson said consumers who lived in communities without plants could pick up the tab for the discounts but the utilities would have to figure that out within their rate system he said a pge spokesman said yesterday that the company does not comment on pending legislation while consumer advocates environmentalists and power generators were lukewarm to the proposal yesterday many admit that the state has not thought about how to of even if they have to offer communities a little incentive to approve a power plant within their borders however the state has allocated three zero million for plants that get online by july one as far as incentives id think most communities would see the value of the employment theyd get and the increase to the tax base said larry hamlin the governors recently appointed project manager for the plantbuilding campaign a spokesman for californias environmental protection agency which permits plants said the plan might be a worthwhile idea for making power plants more palatable to californians michael shames head of utility consumer action network in san diego said the bill was attacking a not in my back yard problem that doesnt exist many san diego communities are clamoring for plants in the hope that they would bring stability to the market he said james peters of mirent the atlantabased company formerly known as southern energy said the plan wouldnt encourage generators to build the number of plants needed to solve the energy crisis already communities like pittsburg have cut deals with power generators before letting them build in exchange for letting the calpine corp build two large plants in town pittsburg received the lifetime option to purchase one zero zero megawatts of power at belowmarket rates next week a pittsburg group is going to begin gathering signatures demanding that city leaders use the estimated two six megawatts it would take to light residences and businesses to give local residents a break on bills the group will hold an organizational meeting at seven pm tuesday at the los medanos community hospital two three one one loveridge rd in pittsburg at last power alerts are lifted enjoy respite because crisis far from resolved experts say by carrie peyton bee staff writer published feb two three two zero zero one as oddly as it arrived californias electric emergency lifted thursday morning at nine am the independent system operator which controls most of californias grid ended a stage one alert it was the first time since jan one three that the state hadnt been under a power emergency declared when low supplies threaten grid stability the alerts included three two straight days of stage three emergencies the black clouds that gather before rotating outages the clouds cleared on a day when predicted peak use was low but not the lowest it has been for the last five weeks many power plants were back on line after repairs but more plants had been operating during at least one stage three day so what happened a little luck a little planning and maybe a little group psychology said those who have closely watched recent gyrations of the states electric roller coaster it is a roll of the dice said gary ackerman head of the western power trading forum which represents plant owners and marketers if it continues for the next three or four weeks i wouldnt be too surprised thatll be our respite enjoy it the end of a four zero day string of emergencies could mean a few more lights in store aisles or a little less worry about running an electric furnace some speculated it might also mean lower wholesale prices but major changes are not likely in the steady rain of conservation calls that have fallen on californians since the north state was twice plunged into rotating blackouts last month i hope people dont just go back to wasteful ways said mike florio of the utility reform network a consumer group now that the emergencies have dissipated we dont have to talk about imposing hardships on people but prudent use of energy is an idea were going to have to live with for a long time he said at the iso longer days and slightly warmer weather was credited with decreasing peak demand for electricity supplies are up within the state and power imports from the pacific northwest have risen significantly said jim detmers who manages grid operations plus in one of the biggest changes the state department of water resources has begun getting more power supplies lined up at least a day in advance he said since the department stepped in to buy power on behalf of cashstrapped utilities it has often managed to line up about seven zero percent to seven five percent of what the state needed to supplement utilitycontrolled supplies according to detmers that meant grid operators had to scramble to buy the rest on very short notice but starting last friday the state began to schedule about nine zero percent of its purchases at least one day in advance the operators are able to enter a day with a lot more confidence about being able to make it detmers said you dont have to search to find those megawatts at the last minute closely in sync with increased purchases by the state the iso dropped from a stage three emergency to stage two on friday and then slid to a stage one wednesday the stages are based on how much reserve power is left for unexpected crises a stage three is declared when reserves slip below one five percent for their part power buyers at the water resources department werent sure what has made the difference over the past few days its certainly not that people are lining up to sell us power at cheap prices said jim spence the departments director of emergency operations were just buying whatever we can and it turned out that it was easier to make ends meet he said he couldnt make any prediction about how long that would last the string of power emergencies has been unpredictable from the start erupting in winter when californias hunger for electricity traditionally declines and supplies are usually so flush that plants close for tuneups consumer advocates and power traders blamed finances for the emergencies rather than a fundamental lack of supply as fears of utility bankruptcies triggered a descent into market chaos and highstakes political maneuvering but basic supply shortages are expected to move to the forefront by summer when temperatures rise and demand soars meanwhile the brief respite whatever the reason brought palpable relief to those charged with keeping the power grid stable when we found out yesterday during the board meeting that we were only in stage one we broke out in applause said florio who sits on the fivemember iso board the change also could be good news for consumers who may one day be paying higher rates for the wholesale electricity now being purchased by the state getting out of a stage three typically means prices are going to ease florio said when youre even in a stage one thats a signal to everybody theyre short that means we can hold them up now davis deadlines on energy much easier set than met by emily bazar bee staff writer published feb two three two zero zero one exactly one week ago gov gray davis sounded hopeful optimistic even when he predicted that the state and its debtridden utilities would forge an agreement by today on a plan to save the companies from financial doom problem is it wont work out that way negotiations between state officials and the investorowned utilities have produced no comprehensive agreement to announce today davis predictions during the energy crisis have been wrong before for weeks he has set deadlines for agreements and legislative action that havent been met on deadline days even when theres little substantive progress to report davis often holds news conferences anyway many of them on friday afternoons after financial markets close the democratic governors office scheduled an announcement for today in los angeles even though one utility representative said agreement is far away davis actions have fueled speculation that hes trying to force consensus by setting artificial deadlines and putting a spin on the news and tarnishing the states credibility in the process i cant see how you would negotiate such a complex deal like the purchase of the transmission grid in such a short period of time it doesnt seem realistic said gary ackerman of the western power trading forum an association of wholesale generators i guess the people i represent have turned it off they have stopped listening they hear it and say ok sure heres another photo op last friday davis told a gathering of reporters that state officials and the utilities would agree by today on a rescue plan for the utilities i believe well have agreement before next week is out on exactly what should go in a piece of legislation he said at the time and hopefully that legislation will be passed by the end of the following week legislative veterans said his comments were illadvised and unrealistic davis met into the night thursday with top officials of pacific gas and electric co but no agrement was reached these are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight said pge spokesman ron low on some issues we are very far away from agreement sources said pge has been unwilling to negotiate sale of its transmission lines which davis has said is a necessary component of a deal more progress was reported with the two other nearbankrupt companies san diego gas and electric co and southern california edison although sources said talks with them were far from concluded davis has been setting specific deadlines for himself and the legislature for months in november the governor promised to present a comprehensive plan by dec one to stave off a fullblown energy crisis but ended up offering only a modest slate of proposals davis called feb one two a drop dead date by which he hoped to cement a deal between lawmakers and the utilities theres no deal yet davis told reporters that he and the states legislative leaders would reach a consensus agreement on the proposal to take to utilities by last friday it didnt happen he made the announcement alone leon panetta a white house chief of staff under former president clinton said its important that the governor set deadlines because the nature of politics is to delay however he cautioned against missing deadlines you have to be careful that you keep the deadlines you establish because the more that you establish and not meet the more that begins to lose its value as a political tool panetta said the governor cant continue to indefinitely set deadlines without facing consequences cautioned steven fetter managing director of the global power group at fitch a creditrating agency based in new york at some point he warned creditors and power suppliers may push the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy which would trigger an official deadline that cant be ignored the dispute would be tied up in court at a judges discretion eventually there is going to be a real deadline fetter said the problem is its probably not a deadline that will be set by gov davis its a deadline that will be set by the banks and the electricity suppliers in several cases when deadlines havent been met davis has held a news conference regardless unveiling little new information and scant detail on jan two six for instance the governor promoted the broad framework of a plan to save the utilities rather than a detailed plan that had been anticipated one prong of the plan aggressively promote energy efficiency conservation and demand reduction among consumers businesses and public entities davis spokesman steve maviglio said that the governor continues to set deadlines because its important to show that the state is making progress particularly to wall street he added that its not the governors fault the deadlines have been missed many of the dates have been blown away by factors no one has been able to foresee or have control over court decisions actions by creditors weather you name it maviglio said the governor sets deadlines that continue to move the ball forward and he has been successful at doing that many of these announcements came after two pm on fridays triggering suggestions that the governor has attempted to spin the facts and manipulate the markets timing announcements after the close of east coast financial markets is commonly used by politicians who dont want to send stocks soaring or tumbling by making an announcement panetta said you want people to evaluate whats happening so there isnt a panic reaction to a news flash going over the wire he said but market analysts say that ever since pge and edison stocks plummeted in early january the governors statements havent significantly affected their performance there has been so much news that has been so negative for the companies that i dont think it makes much of a difference said ed schuller a senior vice president for the fullservice brokerage firm sutro co its beyond that point now gop sees power crisis as davis achilles heel republicans line up to run for governor fridayfebruary two three two zero zero one two zero zero one san francisco chronicle democratic gov gray davis politically wounded by the states power woes has become the target of a growing pack of republicans looking to turn him out of office four months ago davis looked on track to get reelected by a voice vote said dan schnur a gop strategist but the energy crisis has exposed vulnerabilities that have encouraged others to look at the two zero zero two governors race the governors backers however are confident california voters will recognize davis is dealing with a problem that has been brewing for years through previous republican administrations if the republicans want to have a fullout firefight over who brought this energy crisis down were ready for it said garry south the governors top political adviser its a fight they cant win with the primary election still more than a year away no one but davis is a sure bet to leap into the contest but at least three names will be circulating when california republicans meet in sacramento this weekend for their state convention secretary of state bill jones los angeles investor bill simon jr and actor arnold schwarzenegger all have made noises about challenging davis but so far their incipient campaigns have been more talk than action simons effort might be the farthest along but he also has the longest way to travel a political unknown the four nine yearold simon runs his familys investment company and has been active in a number of charitable organizations in southern california simon whose father was treasury secretary under president richard nixon has brought in veteran gop consultant sal russo to study a possible run for governor bill simon feels we need a governor whos prepared to lead and not one whos focused on fundraising or the next political office russo said in a jab at davis simon was an assistant us attorney in new york but founded william e simon sons with his brother and late father in one nine eight eight the two billion private investment firm owns a number of companies and has also invested heavily in south of market real estate in san francisco wealthy political outsiders dont have an enviable record in recent california elections republican michael huffington spent two nine million to lose a one nine nine four senate race to dianne feinstein darrell issa dropped around one three million in a losing race for the one nine nine eight gop senate nomination al checchi spent about three eight million of his own money to lose the democratic primary to davis in one nine nine eight while simon likely would be spending plenty of his own money on a governors bid hes working to get outside support both political and financial before committing to the race russo said with the states problems mounting and the economy increasingly shaky the time may be ripe for a political unknown he added when things start going bad people are willing to look outside for a new face someone who will get things done russo said jones is anything but a political outsider a veteran legislator from the fresno area he is now serving his second and last term as californias secretary of state he managed to hang onto his job during the gops one nine nine eight electoral debacle which cost the party every other constitutional office while jones has long talked about a run for governor hes still playing coy we have not made any decision and probably wont make one until early march said rob lapsley one of jones top advisers right now were putting together information for bill to make a decision while jones role as the states top gop officeholder makes him an obvious choice to challenge davis hes made a number of political enemies over the years many of them in his own party his surprise decision last year to switch his support from george w bush to arizona sen john mccain in californias presidential primary won him no fans among bush supporters and could hurt his attempts to raise money for a gubernatorial bid money is a major problem for jones who listed one one eight zero zero zero in his campaign fund last month compared with nearly two six million for davis some of his opponents have suggested that fundraising woes may force jones to run for an office other than governor right now were focused on the governors race lapsley insisted the real republican wild card is schwarzenegger the movie action hero who would be instantly recognized by nearly every california voter while schwarzeneggers publicist told the chronicle last month that he had no plans to get involved in next years governors race the austrianborn star was on the telephone to a los angeles times columnist days later talking about his love for politics and his political ambitions fame however has its drawbacks as the five three yearold schwarzenegger has found an article in premiere magazine entitled arnold the barbarian accused him of groping women on movie sets and generally boorish behavior while the supermarket tabloids have him on the cover this week suggesting that his marriage to maria shriver is on the rocks south davis political adviser gleefully sent copies of the premiere article to reporters across the state suggesting that the piece lays out a real touching story if you get what i mean whoever ends up with the gop nomination still will face an uphill battle against davis a popular governor and a take no prisoners campaigner ive been predicting since day one that the gop would find some moneybags candidate to throw against gray south said thats why weve kept our political and fundraising operation going since election day pressure is on utilities to accept grid sale energy gov davis wants accord today but edison executive says company might prefer bankruptcy by dan morain and nancy vogel times staff writers sacramentohis credibility at risk and californias energy future on the line gov gray davis on thursday turned up the heat on the states utilities to accept today a series of tentative rescue accords that would put the companies transmission systems into public hands how far the utilities are willing to bend to the governors intensified pressure was unclear late thursday given davis mandate a top executive of southern california edison said his company is now being forced to seriously contemplate whether it might fare better in bankruptcy court we are weighing two very unpalatable alternatives he said two alternatives facing the utilities are either to sell their electrical transmission systems to the state at a price they consider too low or gamble in bankruptcy court that they could hang onto their valuable assets after nearly a week of negotiations davis administration officials said they hoped to announce today a partial deal that would calm the utilities jittery creditors and help subdue californias runaway electricity market state officials said thursday they were close to agreements with edison and san diego gas electric but remained at odds with the states biggest utility pacific gas electric which has balked at giving up its transmission grid these are complex issues that cannot be resolved overnight said pge spokesman ron lowe there are clearly some areas where we are very far apart on thursday edison chairman john bryson conferred with members of his utilitys board of directors but by evening the companys top executives still had not decided whether to acknowledge that an agreement is near although the utility has begun to contemplate the protections of bankruptcy it is unclear when or if such a dramatic action would occur davis is believed to be offering roughly seven billion for the utilities transmission grids the companies could use the cash to restructure their debt which resulted from the utilities inability to pass along their soaring wholesale electricity costs to ratepayers davis has significant political and fiscal reasons for wanting to make an announcement today he is scheduled to arrive in washington for the national governors assn conference this weekend meet with us energy secretary spencer abraham on sunday and attend the democratic governors assn annual fundraising dinner monday night davis a prodigious fundraiser is chairman of the democratic governors assn and the dinner is expected to raise more than five million of that amount davis political organization raised in excess of one million said garry south his chief political advisor any progress davis can cite could help improve his national political standing but his aides say its especially important to be able to show at least a semblance of an agreement when he travels to new york on wednesday to confer with wall street analysts on thursday those analysts reacted exuberantly to early hints from the governors office that settlements with the utilities might be announced the recently anemic stocks of edison international and pge corp soared on the new york stock exchange on a day when most utility stocks closed lower edison jumped one five zero per share or one one one five to close at one four nine five while pge gained one four nine or one one four one to one four five five per share that suggests that someone thinks something good is happening in sacramento said analyst james d von riesemann of morgan stanley dean witter co but some analysts fear investor enthusiasm might be hasty im concerned that the governors optimism may not coincide with all the parties at the table and it may not coincide with the legislature said paul patterson utility analyst at credit suisse first boston corp davis met thursday with steve baum chairman of sempra the parent company of sdge administration officials are confident that an agreement can be reached but the san diego company is the smallest of the states three major private utilities and its debt is far smallersix zero five million compared to the combined one two seven billion that edison and pge say they have amassed baum is willing to listen said sempra spokesman doug kline were on the record as stating that we are willing to consider the sale of those transmission assets if it helps solve the crisis pge executives had been scheduled to start meeting with davis at one one am thursday but in what was seen a slight against pge davis aides did not summon negotiators for the northern california utility including company chairman robert glynn until after three three zero although the parties continued to wrangle over details there was progress thursday on the sidelines state officials announced they had signed a longterm contract for a relatively small amount of electricity with a major energy supplieran achievement that was perhaps more symbolic than substantive tulsabased williams cos said it had agreed to a one zero year deal to sell power to the department of water resources by april the company will provide at least one seven five megawattsenough electricity to supply one seven five zero zero zero homesat times of the day when demand for electricity soars such peak supplies will increase through next summer and reach nine zero zero megawatts by two zero zero six according to williams the agreement is only the second such longterm contract since davis signed a bill feb one putting the department of water resources into the powerbuying business for many years to come at least one zero other power suppliers have reached understandings with the state davis said wednesday but those companies refuse to sign deals the governor said until the state finds a way to help californias two biggest utilities pay off their billiondollar debts as soon as we revitalize the utilities the governor said i think youll see a lot of movement on longterm contracts another small but important piece of the states energy plan emerged thursday when legislation was introduced by sen jim battin rla quinta to slash the rates paid to alternative energy producersa move expected to shave three billion or more in annual costs charged to the big private utilities reducing the amount paid to producers of renewable energy such as solar wind and biomass power is considered a crucial step in keeping expected consumer rate hikes down and after four zero days of dangerously low electricity supplies the state got a reprieve thursday morning when grid officials lifted the states electrical emergency status for the first time since jan one three so far the state has spent nearly two billion buying electricity on behalf of the utilities according to the department of finance which informed the legislature on thursday that it will release another five zero zero million for electricity purchases times staff writers nancy rivera brooks nancy cleeland and mitchell landsberg in los angeles and julie tamaki and jenifer warren in sacramento contributed to this story energy firms wont pay all of monster debt puc reverses taxpayers could foot the bill christian berthelsen chronicle staff writer fridayfebruary two three two zero zero one under a ruling yesterday by state regulators california taxpayers could be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in power purchases the state has made in behalf of two troubled utilities the california public utilities commission voted unanimously to absolve pacific gas and electric co and southern california edison of responsibility for any costs above the revenue they collect from ratepayers the ruling reversed a position taken earlier by the commission which had said the utilities were responsible for making up the difference between the states costs and their own revenue john tremaine a pge spokesman said the funding needed to make up the difference could come in the form of a surcharge imposed on customers who use one three zero percent of the baseline amount of electricity that is one option under a bill passed last month by the legislature he said but steve maviglio a spokesman for gov gray davis said the governor does not believe the money will come from ratepayers electric bills the costs maviglio said could be covered by the one zero billion bond measure the state recently issued to cover power purchases as california tries to resolve its power crisis state officials are working out the precise way that should be done under the states deregulation plan approved in one nine nine six the utilities have been forced to absorb skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs while being prevented by law from passing the increases on to customers through higher rates since the california department of water resources began buying power last month details showing how it will be repaid how much or by whom have not been established yesterdays puc decision was an attempt to begin setting the repayment criteria a precise accounting of how much money is at stake is impossible to determine at this point officials said because pge declines to release ratepayer revenue figures and the state is refusing to say exactly how much it has spent buying power officials estimate the state will spend two three billion by the beginning of march and davis authorized the expenditure of five zero zero million more yesterday the states department of water resources became the buyer of record on jan one seven when the two utilities credit was so damaged that they were no longer able to buy power both utilities had opposed the commissions previous position that they be responsible for all power costs the pucs shift yesterday was summed up by commissioner richard bilas who said he could not support holding the utilities responsible for the revenue shortfall the dwr is not about to go bankrupt the utilities are he said yet consumer advocates downplayed the commissions ruling yesterday nettie hoge executive director of the utility reform network said the ruling only dealt with the narrow issue of who has to account for the revenue shortfall and did not reach an overarching decision about who ultimately will be financially responsible for it this is not a huge deal she said the state has been buying the lions share of its power in the realtime market run by the independent system operator since the demise of the longer term california power exchange said jesus arredondo a spokesman for the exchange the state has been paying premium prices because it is buying in a market that was designed to handle lastminute emergencies the governors office has been seeking cheaper longterm power contracts with only modest results small electric producers ok big price cut by ed mendel staff writer february two three two zero zero one sacramento legislators said yesterday that small generators who produce about three zero percent of the states power have agreed to cut their power prices in half an important step toward easing the electricity crisis negotiations continued on what gov gray davis has called the final step the state purchase of the transmission systems of the three investorowned utilities in exchange for paying off their huge debt meanwhile the amount that the state is spending to buy power for the customers of the utilities grows officials gave notice that an additional five zero zero million will be needed in one zero days bringing the total to two six billion but for the first time in nearly six weeks the state did not declare an alert yesterday due to power shortages more power was available from other states and some power plants that had been shut down for maintenance resumed operation two legislators sen jim battin rpalm desert and assemblyman fred keeley dboulder creek said they introduced legislation that sharply reduces the prices paid to small generators after weeks of difficult negotiations ultimately this bill will reduce the cost of energy to the state and its ratepayers by billions of dollars said battin who represents eastern san diego county about half of the small generators use renewable technologies such as solar wind geothermal and biomass the rest is cogeneration when fuel is used for industrial purposes and electricity is generated as a byproduct the small generators have grown to produce nearly a third of californias power under a twodecadeold federal qualifying facilities program which requires utilities to buy their power battin and keeley said that under the bill sb four seven x the average price for these qf contracts could drop from the current one seven cents per kilowatthour to about eight to eight five cents per kilowatthour we believe that the rates are at least that low if not lower said jan smutnyjones executive director of the independent energy producers which represents small and large generators the small generators support the bill because it will give them a stable price for five years avoiding ups and downs and the possibility that state regulators might make a more unfavorable price cut much of the current price formula is based on the price of natural gas at the california border which has soared this winter the legislation spreads the price bench mark over a fiveyear period we encourage the legislature to take quick action to approve sb four seven x as quickly as possible to help stabilize the electricity crisis smutnyjones said he said one of the side agreements to the legislation is the creation of a portfolio of longterm contracts to purchase natural gas for some cogenerators lowering their production costs the legislation was applauded as a major step forward by a group of small generators who formed a creditors committee last week and threatened to take the utilities into bankruptcy we call on the legislature and the governor to act on it immediately said chris thompson a spokesman for the group thompson said southern california edison continues to collect money from ratepayers as the state buys power for its customers but is not paying anything to the small nonpolluting generators a spokesman for a geothermal generator in el centro which filed a lawsuit seeking four five million from edison for power provided since november welcomed the legislation for giving generators stability and ratepayers cheaper power but vince signorotti a spokesman for calenergy said it would be premature to consider dropping the lawsuit battin and keeley said that payment of the small generators depends on the governors attempt to negotiate the purchase of the transmission systems of edison pacific gas and electric and san diego gas and electric in exchange for payment of their debt as part of the governors plan the utilities would agree to provide lowcost power for five to one zero years from their generators which provide about a third of the states power davis aides are attempting to negotiate longterm contracts with generators for the remaining third of the power required by the state sharply reducing the cost of buying power on the expensive spot market but the governor said this week that many generators are reluctant to sign longterm contracts until they know how the utilities will pay their debt for previous power purchases the state called off all power alerts yesterday for the first time since midjanuary rescinding a stage one alert declared wednesday grid operators made the change after increased power supplies became available the supply situation this week has gradually been improving said lorie odonley a spokeswoman with the california independent system operator which manages most of the states power supplies however she said the improvements shouldnt deter consumers from conservation it is good news to be out of electrical emergencies but we just want to remind everybody that we are looking at a longterm power supply situation here she said and the highdemand summer is just around the corner so we would ask that people continue with their conservation efforts in san francisco yesterday state power regulators decided unanimously that the department of water resources is responsible for buying any power that cashstrapped utilities are unable to generate or buy on their own no matter what price wholesalers are charging but the puc voted three two against taking action that would have allowed the dwr to receive a portion of ratepayer revenues from the utilities to help cover the cost of buying electricity the state through the dwr was authorized by a recent law to buy power for the utilities edison and pge have such low credit ratings that no power companies will sell to them sdges rating is much better but its debt also was mounting the dwr purchases that portion of electricity beyond what the utilities provide through their own generating plants and through existing longterm contracts but the dwr has refused to buy power beyond a certain price that means more lastminute power purchases on the expensive spot market the utilities and the state had disagreed over how the dwr will be reimbursed whether through state bonds or ratepayer dollars and the extent of its powerbuying role the author of the bill authorizing the longterm contracts assemblyman keeley said the legislations intent was to fully cover the onethird of the power that utilities purchased on the spot market either through extended contracts or through the state iso staff writer karen kucher and the associated press contributed to this

electricity daily has ferc gone far enough in california the federal energy regulatory commission isnt going far enough in its attempt to reform the california wholesale electric market according to a paper by three prominent economists done for san diego gas and electric the paper by john d chandley scott m harvey and william w hogan argues that ferc should first end the artificial separation that divides the california power exchange and the california independent system operator rather than worrying about the governance of the two institutions the change in governance may help says the paper electricity market reform in california but it is not likely to be decisive in the near term explicit guidance from the commission regarding the nature and trajectory of reforms will be essential if market reform is to be accomplished within an acceptable time frame hogan of the kennedy school of government has been writing since one nine nine five in opposition to californias market separation also argues the paper freeing the california utilities to engage in forward contracting is no panacea the expectation that merely allowing utilities to participate in forward contracting necessarily would be the solution to high prices is problematic and not supported by the commissions staff report says the analysis adding that putting pressure on buyers to sign contracts in the present environment may make things worse if the underlying problem in california is high cost and low capacity requiring forward contracting could harm not only california but also the entire western us electric system fercs one five zero socalled soft cap is a wild card that has the three economists scratching their heads it does not appear in the staff report and there is little critical analysis of their implications other than the discussion of commissioner curt hebert if the intent of the soft cap is to move toward cost justification for bids above one five zero mwh then ferc is headed into an administrative morass that would rival those under wellhead price controls in the natural gas industry if on the other hand the soft cap is truly soft and would only require some paper work at ferc and the possibility of a refund if the price is eventually deemed not just and reasonable there might be little impact on consumer prices particularly if the principal sources of those high prices are high costs and regional capacity shortages rather than the exercise of market power even so the proposal might serve to deter entry and new investments thus combining the worst of both worlds high consumer prices and little or no new investment fercs proposed order in california also demonstrates confusion about just what constitutes market power the paper cites the proposed orders lawyerly obfuscatory conclusion that while this record does not support findings of specific exercises of market power and while we are not able to reach definite conclusions about the actions of individual sellers there is clear evidence that in california market structure and rules provide the opportunity for sellers to exercise market power when supply is tight and can result in unjust and unreasonable rates under the federal power act the economists note in this regard the debate is confused because we are dancing around the words where the truth may be hard to face in the case of california say the economists there is no evidence of market power even the practice of generators avoiding the dayahead market in favor of the realtime market is a response to bad market design and pricing incentives including price caps but does not demonstrate the exercise of market power nor is bidding above marginal cost necessarily an exercise of market power they add the distinction between direct marginal cost and opportunity cost is sometimes lost in the discussion hence a competitive bidder whose direct cost of generation is four zero but who could sell the same energy outside california for one zero zero should bid no less than one zero zero this would not be an exercise of market power,02:02:00

three two zero zero zero newswatch latest headlines san diego cbsmw the federal government will provide grants and loans to help local residents and businesses pay for soaring electricity bills president clinton said wednesday clinton said two six million will be earmarked to help lowincome families and seniors pay for electricity bills that have more than doubled he urged the small business administration to provide loans to companies that are struggling to pay power bills he also called for expediting the investigation of wholesale power markets by the federal energy regulatory commission well do what we can to help you the president said during a televised news conference at the white house in washington test case yields public outcry the san diego area is a test case for the rest of the country over the feasibility of electric industry deregulation the region which also encompasses south orange county north of san diego is the first in the nation to have its power market completely deregulated new york new england and midatlantic states are following suit and theyre watching california carefully thus far the san diego test has turned out to be a shambles electricity supply that hasnt increased in one zero years failed this summer to meet strong demand resulting from a growing state with market forces in play for the first time strong demand led to much higher wholesale rates that was passed along to residents after a public outcry the california public utilities commission on monday approved a plan that would cap customers electric bills for normal use but theyll pay market rates for anything extra utility companies also can collect on any shortfalls later today on cbs marketwatch nasdaq inches higher dow lags oil inventories at two four

two zero zero zero three zero two zero eight pmet in other words if the electric company cant pass along the entire cost of buying the energy for now theyll be able to pass it along months later therefore people who are used to seeing lower electricity bills for the cooler months in fall and winter wont see much of a dropoff its a shameful paynoworpaylater plan said bob finkelstein staff attorney for the utility reform network a consumer advocacy group california jumped off the deregulation cliff state legislators which have the power to expand on the commissions ruling shelved a plan to roll back rates to midone nine nine nine levels and cap them for customers of san diego gas electric a sempra energy sre news msgs subsidiary they faced opposition from gov gray davis a democrat and from republican lawmakers davis prefers a plan that would cut rates by six zero percent immediately but that would stipulate customers pay the full amount of what they owe later republican lawmakers want the state to use taxpayers money to help pay electric bills for consumers while businesses get tax credits san diego fiasco the southern california fiasco came about as a result of a deregulated electricity market that began two years ago the effects of deregulation are being felt first in the san diego area because it was the first to end its rate freeze last summer the rest of california should follow region after region by two zero zero two the idea sounded good deregulate the electric industry and let the market set the prices with competition rates should come down and service should improve when the longdistance phone market was deregulated it did bring about low prices and greater competition but things got messed up along the way for one the hope that consumers and businesses could one day shop for electricity as they shop for better deals among longdistance carriers was dashed at least for now initially hundreds of companies had signed up to offer power but most have gone out of business or left the market of the remaining companies most serve the more lucrative corporate market said linda sherry a spokeswoman at consumer action also the strategy of letting housing developments form power cooperatives and negotiate better rates didnt pan out sherry said demand far outstrips supply demand for power in california surged as businesses and the population grew but supply didnt grow with it because no new electric generation plants have been built in the state for one zero years last year the state approved five applications to build new plants but theyre years away from becoming operational under the deregulated market electric utility companies were mandated to sell their power generation plants by separating the provider of electricity and the generator of electricity the idea is to usher in a more competitive market today san diego gas electric buys from electric generators through an auction market but the auction market rules as set up actually make the situation in san diego worse according to the federal energy regulatory commission when electric utilities accept bids from generators at various prices they are required to pay to everyone the rate of the highest bid but in a situation where the electric company needs all the power available it has to accept all the bids and apply the highest price to every deal inflating the cost electric generators were taking advantage of the situation by charging more sherry said ferc is investigating and plans to issue a report later this year but for now price caps have been set utility company buffeted ed van herik a sempra spokesman said the auction rules are putting the squeeze on utility companies already buffeted from all sides by public outcry and political pressure but utility reform networks finkelstein said san diego gas electric isnt totally blameless because it could have done a better job of hedging high costs they could have entered into futures contracts to hedge these risks which would have allowed the utility to buy electricity at prices under normal conditions the attorney said,07:19:00
