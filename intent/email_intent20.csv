Legislation,steve as you requested the following is a detailed update on pipeline safety legislation currently moving through congress pipeline safety reauthorization legislation authorization for pipeline safety programs as administered by the us dept of transportation office of pipeline safety ops is currently set to expire at the end of fy two zero zero zero at the beginning of the one zero six th congress industry was focused on securing a simple two year reauthorization bill that basically extends current pipeline safety programs with some modest increases in funding levels in fact the house commerce committee who shares jurisdiction over pipeline safety with the transportation infrastructure committee acted early in one nine nine nine to pass a simple two year reauthorization bill hr one three seven eight unfortunately the issue became more complex from that point a serious liquid pipeline accident in bellingham washington that occurred last summer killing several children dramatically changed the debate over pipeline safety members of the house and senate from washington state backed by the governor and numerous state and local officials moved swiftly to introduce legislation that they feel is designed to address some of the shortcomings in federal pipeline regulation that they believe may have allowed the bellingham incident to occur in the senate senator patty murray dwa has introduced s two zero zero four which is designed to expand state authority over interstate pipelines in several new areas such as inspection and testing emergency response plans leak detection and operator training and qualification the bill also would authorize a large increase in ops funding through pipeline user fees to increase the amount of grants to the states allow for hiring of additional inspectors and increase rd for inspection and leak detection technologies the current ops budget is around three six million with three zero million from user fees the murray bill would authorize five zero million in fytwo zero zero one which would require a sizeable increase in user fees senator slade gorton rwa has recently decided to cosposnor the murray bill and will be actively involved in trying to gain republican support for the bill on the house side rep jack metcalf rwa has introduced a similar bill hr three five five eight which a number of the washington representatives have cosponsored interstate natural gas pipelines have been placed in a very difficult situation the bellingham incident was a liquid pipeline accident and liquids pipelines generally have less stringent regulatory requirements than natural gas pipelines the washington delegation has highlighted the fact that two eight zero deaths and one five zero zero injuries have occurred over the past one four years related to natural gas pipeline incidents but they fail to distinguish the fact that almost all of those incidents were on ldc systems which ironically are entirely state regulated only three nine fatalities in that period were naturalgas related and the majority of those accidents were caused by third party damage in short the ingaa crowd is being dragged down by the poor records of the ldcs and the liquid pipelines the calls for more state regulation of interstate pipeline are largely misguided based on the fact that the interstate pipelines under federal regulation have an exemplary safety record in addition ops is already working on a pipeline integrity rulemaking that would implement a number of additional measures to prevent accidents on federallyregulated pipelines as you mentioned ingaa has not been doing the best job representing us on these issues they have been working in a group effort with api aga and the association of oil pipelines aopl to try and deflect the negative claims of the murray and metcalf legislation but have not been forceful enough in distinguishing interstate natural gas pipelines positive record from the liquids and ldcs thus they have given the impression that ingaa companies might be willing to submit to additional regulation that liquids and ldc are under political pressure to submit to due to bellingham we have been working with other major ingaa companies el paso in particular to make sure that the perspective and positive record of our natural gas pipelines is heard clearly by the key legislators the odds of these measures s two zero zero four hr three five five eight passing on their own is fairly slim they will get a great deal of attention however the senate commerce committee held a field hearing in bellingham washington yesterday at which senators gorton and murray testified along with ops and the families of bellingham victims the press coverage was not good ie usa today cover story when pipelines are time bombs these bills or portions of them will likely be offered and considered as amendments to pipeline safety reauthorization legislation as it comes before the house transportation infrastructure and senate commerce committee later this year the increased controversy caused by these bills will likely doom efforts to pass a pipeline safety reauthorization bill this year the leadership of the house and senate committees will not likely want to face a bitter debate between safety advocates ops states and industry in their committees in this tough election year while this is probably a good sign there is an increased risk that industry may face some large hurdles in the appropriations process appropriations legislation while members of congress push for their stand alone bills andor amendments to reauthorization bills the greater danger is that some of these issues will be dealt with in an appropriations context in particular the fact that senator slade gorton is now actively engaged in pushing for extensive pipeline safety reforms is troubling he is a key member of the senate appropriations committee is close to republican leadership and has a tough reelection fight coming up senator murray is also on senate appropriations both are on the transportation appropriations subcommittee which funds ops it is quite likely that the senators will make a push to get increases in the ops budget for fy two zero zero one that would enable the kinds of reforms contemplated by their standalone legislation more state funding more inspectors more rd much of this increase would be funded through increases in user fees ingaa indicates that it expects we could be facing increases in the range of one zero one five from fytwo zero zero zero there is also the possibility that an attempt will be made to add legislative riders to the ops appropriations such as requiring ops to mandate inspections increase operator qualifications or allow increased state authority i would predict that legislative riders can be prevented but it will be very difficult to avoid some kind of increases beyond mere adjustments for inflation in the ops budget and user fees the reauthorization will indeed receive attention in two zero zero zero but our advocacy efforts will clearly need to be focused on the appropriations process in order to minimize the impact on interstate pipeline user fees and prevent other harmful mandates we will continue to work with key members of the authorizing and appropriations committees to ensure that the interstate natural gas perspective is clearly heard and if possible we avoid being dragged down in attempts to impose more strict regulation on liquids and ldcs please let me know if you have

for long island and new york city areas while such icap requirements have historically been set as a single number for the entire year it is nypas belief that this holdover from the old way of doing business must be reexamined it is nypas belief that most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the summer months as such some reduction in winter icap requirements should be possible with no impact on the loss of load criterion of one day in ten years nypa requested that the iso start with the database that resulted in the locational requirements of eight zero and nine eight for new york city and long island respectively at nypas request the iso modeled winter ratings on the transmission interfaces into nyc and li and determined how much the eight zero and nine eight could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the statewide loss of load occurred the report indicates that winter requirements of seven five and nine two of the summer peak load resulted for nyc and li respectively while this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter locational requirements the results from this study suggest that some reduction in the winter requirement may be warranted and a consideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future icap requirement studies nypa believes that having an icap requirement for summer and winter seasons based on the lses peak load for the respective season would send the proper icap price signal nypa is sharing the study results in the attached report in an effort to begin a dialog which we hope will lead to

published april two zero two zero zero one ca governor regulators push on but legislature raises doubts two certainties prevailed in californias blighted energy landscape thursday wholesale power bills are getting bigger and state regulators are trying harder to salvage gov gray davis deal with southern california edison co but in the state legislature from which the ultimate solutions must come there was growing skepticism despite a series of meetings with the governor earlier in the week while nervousness over the states electricity bill and the prospect of insufficient power supplies this summer prevailed davis met with two five members of californias congressional delegation at a los angeles airport hotel to press his case for federal actions to resolve the seemingly endless energy dilemma the california public utilities commission has ordered a statewide investigation of the contractual obligations of the almost seven zero zero small qualifying facility qf generators toward the utilities but most of the fivemember commissions activity was focused outside its regular business meeting in san francisco cpuc president loretta lynch offered empathy toward edisons financial plight and renewed pleas for federal regulators to provide wholesale price relief i have committed that the cpuc will expeditiously review those provisions of edisons proposed agreement that require cpuc resolution and i have taken steps to begin that process lynch said in a prepared statement released wednesday in the meantime i commit to reviewing on a priority basis any and all proposals that promote the financial health of california utilities and the interests of its consumers davis and some of the cpuc commissioners have been complaining that the cost of the states daily purchases of wholesale power on the spot market have increased from about five zero million to more than seven zero million daily since the april six bankruptcy filing of pacific gas and electric co but the utility challenged the conclusion that the court filing caused the latest price increases while it is understandable even laudable that the governor would want to fully explain the downsides of utility bankruptcy this claim is simply not accurate said pge utility spokesperson john nelson he argued that the increase in state payments for power reflect that the state water resources department dwr now is covering all spot purchases including the often costly realtime emergency purchases by the states transmission grid operator caliso thus pges spokesperson said the more likely cause of the increased power bill lies with recent moves by federal regulators and caliso noting that the state grid operator should only sell to creditworthy entities these moves were done independent of the pge bankruptcy filing nelson said as the daily bill for power goes up draining the state treasury more quickly pressure mounts for a resolution to the utility financial situation but the legislature has expressed skepticism toward the governors proposed deal with edison state senate leader john burton dsan francisco told news media wednesday that bankruptcy might be the best approach for edison in adopting the new investigations of qf generators the cpucs commissioners acknowledged that eventually the issue of back payments to the small generators needs to be addressed

Announcements for Rockies,pipe expansions planned for rockies region with several pipeline companies well into addressing the pipeline capacity shortages that persist as natural gas production grows throughout the rocky mountain region kinder morgan interstate gas transmission llc kmigt announced two major projects wednesday and several other companies detailed expansions planned or in the works during the closing session at the one three th annual rocky mountain natural gas strategy conference headlining the news was kmigts plans to use existing rightsofway to build the advantage pipeline which would fill the same needs as the colorado interstate gas pipe moving from the cheyenne hub to the midcontinent an open season is scheduled on the proposed pipe this fall dave scharf business development director for kmigt said the two four inch pipe which would move gas primarily from the powder river basin would have a capacity of three three zero mmcfd delivering to interconnects on its way to the kansas city markets it would have a smaller size with about four zero less content scharf said but it would be expandable to four five zero mmcfd with access to liquid midcontinent pipes local distribution centers and enduse markets a smaller pipeline neco a one two inch pipe about nine five miles long would serve the northeastern colorado market although small scharf emphasized that it would reduce some of the bottlenecks now evident in moving gas in that part of the state and would also allow backhauls to cheyenne an open season on this line is also scheduled this fall scharf said kmigt also is planning to expand its storage capacity in the rockies adding more horsepower at the cheyenne hub and huntsman facility the huntsman would be expanded to deliver seven five mmcfd with delivery at cheyenne of four five mmcfd we want to customize shippers needs scharf said of the expansion noting there were synergies between the three projects he said kmigt was on a growth plan that would use both acquisitions and expansion rocky mountain growth opportunities we see are in wyoming colorado kansas and nebraska he said el pasos craig coombs who directs project development for the companys western pipeline group said el paso also is expanding its pipelines east from the rockies with a cheyenne to midcontinent connection spending three eight zero million to add five four

inservice date in late two zero zero three or early two zero zero four coombs also updated attendees on the cig expansion along the front range of the rockies which he said is on track to be in service by midtwo zero zero four over the next four years coombs said supply from the rockies would grow from five bcfd to seven five bcfd and warned there would be blood on the streets if pipeline systems are not expanded coombs said el paso planned to file its request with the federal energy regulatory commission in january two zero zero two for its ruby pipeline which is scheduled to carry two five zero mdthd from the rockies into nevada and five zero zero mdthd into california the ruby project said coombs is designed with power plants in mind the pipeline will be three zero three six inches with four zero zero zero zero horsepower el pasos western frontier pipeline project which also closed its open season in july is also is on schedule with a ferc filing by the fourth quarter of this year and an inservice target date by november two zero zero three whats driving all of these expansions are the power plant projects coombs said with more than nine two zero zero mw proposed in the region in the coming years he said capacity would rise more than two bcfd by two zero one zero noting that every planned expansion might not come to fruition because of competing proposals coombs said that there is still tremendous growth in the rockies shelley wright supervisor of capacity marketing for questar pipeline co detailed the many projects her company has under way in the rockies including its main line one zero four the clay basin projects the southern trails pipe to california and its work on the eakin compressors the main line one zero four a joint venture with el pasos cig

she also noted that the clay basin which is the largest storage facility in the western united states was already ahead of schedule for two zero zero one two zero zero two storage were seeing more interest in getting storage filled this year than last wright said noting that storage was depleted last winter the clay basin facility will undergo testing tentatively in april two zero zero two

conservancy about the proposed sundevil pipeline construction project she was very cordial and appreciative concerning transwesterns proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established she did offer some general yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of flagstaff into roughly northern phoenix the area south of flagstaff into phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the tnc with major biological diversity of plants and animals the tnc has completed published studies on two of the regions the tnc has requested that should this project be apporved these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by ferc to the south and east of flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the verde river which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the river this river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across arizona i have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies in addition to the tnc and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of arizona i think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and

likelihood of trouble is accurate i also agree with your implicit premise that if ferc or anyone else wanted to make trouble regarding our negotiated rate deals the easiest approach and the most direct one is to challenge the deals as unjust and unreasonable under nga section four five to challenge the deals under some state law gouging theory would give rise to preemption defenses on our part etc ill talk to you and kathy further tomorrow am and then we can grab mike to discuss thanks df susan scott one one two two two zero zero zero one two one four pm to drew fossumetsenronenron cc kathy ringblometsenronenron subject re gouging as to your question about whats going on in california ive done some reading and here are my thoughts the nov one ferc order in docket no elzero zero nine five zero zero zero in which the commission ordered a one five zero mwh price cap among other things was predicated on the commissions authority under section two zero six of the federal power act specifically the fpa provides that if the commission finds that any rate charge or classification for jurisdictional services or any rule regulation practice or contract affecting such rate charge or classification is unjust or unreasonable the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate charge classification rule regulation practice or contract that should be in effect the commission recognized that certain areas of the flawed california market are not within its jurisdiction but fixed the areas within its jurisdiction apparently the california governor agrees with me that the commissions jurisdiction in the area of wholesale electricity prices is questionable in any event if the commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates its authority to do so would be much clearer the natural gas act expressly authorizes ferc to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just and reasonable just and reasonable has been interpreted in many different contexts and the commission has significant discretion over what it means as we all know too well the commission sometimes acts unpredictably however my feeling is that it will probably take more than two or three abovemaxrate contracts to motivate the ferc to act to declare a negotiated rate deal struck within a pipelines tariff authority to be unjust and unreasonable the california proceeding was initiated after entire communities of individual consumers suffered two zero zero three zero zero increases in their electricity bills the prices for electricity in california were outrageous across the board and affected everyone in the state by contrast tws transport rates for its shortterm deals are far removed from end user prices and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not widespread enough for anyone to notice it is far from being a consumer issue and besides the elections are over however as you and i have already discussed we must be wary of parties like dynegy that do notice just about everything and who might try to draw it to fercs attention we do need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving california are doing the same types of deals kathy why dont you and i discuss a system of monitoring the contract information postings of el paso kern pgtnw drew obviously ive only scratched the surface here so lets talk if you want a more indepth report from drew fossum one one two one two zero zero zero one zero three six am to susan scottetsenronenron cc kathy ringblometsenronenron subject re gouging that is by far the best line of the day unconscionability may be the thing im remembering but i think there is some more specific law related to market dislocationsie the hurricane example its sort of a twist on market power lawie if the fates hand you short term market power you better not use it df susan scott one one two one two zero zero zero one zero zero eight am to drew fossumetsenronenron cc kathy ringblometsenronenron subject re gouging i know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because they are unconscionable there are several examples in consumer law and employment law in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other is a west palm beach voter however if my memory serves me correctly none of them involve contracts between two sophisticated business entities such as tw and sempra or pge absent evidence of fraud courts uphold bargains struck at arms length kathy id be happy to take the oars on this but if youve already done some looking please let me know if youve found anything from drew fossum one one two zero two zero zero zero zero four four four pm to susan scottetsenronenron kathy ringblometsenronenron cc subject gouging stuck on the phone so i thought id email you stan has asked mike moran if tw has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under anti gouging statutes or common law you know the laws that say you cant charge one zero zero per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or five zero for a bucket of water during a drought i think we need to research two things one are there any such laws applicable to our business cal state law would probably be the best place to start two could the politicalregulatory fight in cal about power and gas prices ever expand all the way to our transport pricing ie if the cpuc whacks the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power its not a big leap for the cpuc or ferc or even us congress to whack gas sellers for jacking prices up to one four mmbtu as happened on friday if that happens its just another small jump to whack us for charging one for transport or so the logic goes id like to hear preliminary views by eight three zero monday am so i can talk to mike before stans staff meeting no written memo necessary based on that prelim research we can decide what else need s to be done

one one zero five am rick antonoff rickantonoffcwtcom zero five three one two zero zero one zero four one nine pm to marycookenroncom cc david mitchell davidmitchellcwtcom subject re letter of creidt question mary the short answer to your questions about letters of credit is that if the creditor drew on the letter of credit for a margin payment or settlement payment under a forward contract or swap it would be excluded from the trustees power to avoid preferences bankruptcy code section five four six e it does not matter if the payment is from the issuing bank or the counterparty since the bankruptcy code protects such payments made by or to a commodity broker or forward contract merchant the pending legislation would clarify this by expanding the definitions of commodity contract forward contract and swap agreement to specifically include credit enhancements related to the contract the powerline case never really bothered me and im curious to know why it bothers the panelists at the seminar you attended the creditors problem in that case is that the letter of credit expired before the preference claim was commenced the fix is to negotiate a letter of credit termination date that is either a nine one days after the maturity date of the contract or b a day or more after the twoyear limitations period for bringing preference actions and in either case make it payable in the event a preference claim is brought and let the bank defend it banks are willing to do it because they collect fees for an indefinitely longer period which makes settling the claim much easier and borrowers are willing to do it because generally they have to the air conditioning case is more troublesome and seems to have been wrongly decided except that theres a quirk in the facts that may justify the result on a quick read the decision seems to violate the independence principle of letters of credit that is that the beneficiarys right to draw on the letter of credit is independent from the issuing banks exposure to the account debtor applying the principle means that even if a pledge of collateral from the account debtor to the issuing bank is a preference thats a matter between the bank and the debtor and does not interfere with the beneficiarys right to draw on the letter of credit for the same reason it should not matter as the court there seemed to focus on that the creditor improved its position by securing its unsecured claim with a secured letter of credit that was precisely the issue in the infamous twistcap decision that has been so roundly criticized even by the judge who rendered it the eleventh circuit in air conditioning seems at first to give no regard to the independence principle when it says that the creditor received a preference by virtue of the debtors pledge of a certificate of deposit to the issuing bank in and of itself that reasoning is in my view wrong however later in the decision the court seems to say that the proceeds of the creditors draw on the letter of credit was in fact the very certificate of deposit pledged by the debtor to the bank the decision is somewhat confusing in that earlier in the opinion it says that the bankruptcy court ordered the bank to return the certificate of deposit to the bankruptcy trustee if the creditor held the certificate of deposit two consequences flow from that fact first it means that while proceeds of letters of credit generally are not property of the debtors bankruptcy estate in this case since the certificate of deposit was merely pledged as collateral to the bank it was indisputably property of the estate the fact that it was conveyed to a third party doesnt change that second if the pledge to the bank was a preference and no party argued that it wasnt then recovering the transferred property from the creditor is the right result although here too i think the courts reasoning misses the mark the court relied on the provision of the avoidance recovery statute section five five zero that allows recovery of preferential transfers from the initial transferee or the entity for whose benefit such transfer was made i believe the certificate of deposit was transferred for the banks reimbursement claim and therefore for its benefit and not the creditors to the extent it is deemed to have been made for the beneficiarys benefit it again ignores the independence principle but the same result could have been reached had the court instead relied on the part of section five five zero that allows recovery from the initial transferee or any immediate transferee from such initial transferee since the creditor received the certificate of deposit it was the immediate transferee from the initial transferee bank of course the fix in this case is to have a letter of credit that provides for more fungible proceeds such as cash and have it come from the banks own funds i hope these comments are helpful please call if you have any questions or wish

 thoughts on the cover note ?",comments in red enron capital trade resources corp from sally beck two six zero nine two zero zero zero two three five seven to mike jordanlonectect cc fernley dysonlonectect subject re a note being sent out under john sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note i think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards but i wonder about the most appropriate timing enough of a global message it is a european note and the means of delivery on the means of delivery i am not sure from your note whether or not i fully understand the intent is there an article to be included in an enron publication yes and in addition a letter to be sent under johns name if so to whom will the letter be sent or is the letter from john an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article yes apologies if there is confusion with regard to a global message i think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities with these operating standards implemented worldwide we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide these global standards also should enable enron to expand its business reach more quickly with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations i am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across agreed but the note was targeted at europe would welcome the opportunity to work on this with you and shona finally a question regarding timing the last i knew after you and brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated shona took this to do after brents return to houston for comments to all business controllers i dont believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed understand and have implemented these standards and not to belittle the process of creating the standards the tough part and the real meat behind this will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards my commitment to rick causey is that i will have that global report in production by the end of the year there is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report shona has commissioned mike moscoso to work on this and i believe that mike has already been working with james new so i question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against would a more appropriate time be after the global operations controller meeting in october when we should have worldwide buyin and commitment to these standards and hopefully our first draft of a meaningful exception report can we discuss this please see separate note from me to shona sorry that this response looks so long i have been interrupted two zero times while responding so i hope that it makes sense thanks for sharing this with me since you asked for input i hope that you dont mind that i gave you some sally certainly not and thanks mike jordan zero nine two six two zero zero zero zero eight one four am to fernley dysonlonectect sally beckhouectect cc subject a note being sent out under john sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note fernley sally off and on with jackie gentles help i have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards itself a one page summary we are in the final stages of this process where we draft a cover letter for john which will introduce this for inclusion within globalflash the enron europe newsletter have you any thoughts on draft or cover note mike,01:58:00,"Yes

what happened in california the source of californiazero one s current problem is as straightforward as supp lytwo zero and demand californiazero one s economy grew two nine percent since one nine nine eight this incr easedtwo zero the demand for electricity by two four percent at the same time regulatorytwo zero restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state so two zero demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added the resul ttwo zero predictably is a shortage this summer peak capacity will be about one zero two zero percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state in addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related two zero factors that led to the current crisis first the statezero one s regulations two zero forced all sales and purchases into the spot market the spot market for two zero power is extraordinarily volatile the way firms behave in a free market two zero when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ngtwo zero term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility i ntwo zero california state regulation prevented this strategy this would be thetwo zero equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th etwo zero most volatile interest rate environment imaginable everything was finetwo zero while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat ttwo zero was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price second retail markets were not deregulated regulated retail rates remain edtwo zero in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keeptwo zero competition out this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa letwo zero prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at thetwo zero regulated retail rate they are now nearly bankrupt in short californiazero one s problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion two zero regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new two zero generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile two zero spot prices at the time california was developing its restructuring plan enron warned two zero the statezero one s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hichtwo zero if adopted would have averted the current crisis enronzero one s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ixtwo zero the problem power sellers including enron have been vilified by thetwo zero politicians and the media here are the facts other than a small amount of wind power enron is not a generator in the two zero state of california every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the two zero same market available to other california purchasers because we are atwo zero market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices we ar etwo zero interested only in having a

here are the facts as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current californiatwo zero market it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers direct lytwo zero from the utilities this decision reduced eeszero one s market price risk bytwo zero allowing ees to access lower utility rates ees did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue totwo zero

can two zero have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of newtwo zero facilities reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand two zero they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is an open retail two zero market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman dtwo zero at lower prices than today california should fully open its retail market reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves fromtwo zero volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer two zero term fixedprice basis the state has instead left procurement in the han dstwo zero of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot

needed just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that two zero while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters two zero worse price caps have been

thursday night lee coach john parchman said friday parchman said benson called ut assistant coach mike tolleson thursday night and told him he wanted to play for the longhorns benson was in el paso for a scrimmage friday night but his mother confirmed the commitment tolleson who coaches defensive tackles is the longhorn assistant who recruits west texas benson is the one three th commitment for the longhorns this recruiting season and he certainly is the most famous after rushing for three five two six yards and four four touchdowns last season he scored seven other touchdowns on pass receptions for a grand total of five one tds no class five a back in texas has ever accounted for as many yards or touchdowns as benson did in leading midland lee to a state title and an undefeated season in one nine nine nine gordon wood possibly the greatest high school coach in texas history after leading stamford and brownwood to multiple state championships before retiring several years ago says benson is the best running back i have ever seen in high school woods teams had some great backs and they played against some other great backs so that is high praise indeed benson is on all the

texas commitment was a national top one zero zero prospect two years ago at houston yates randall by the way had hoped to enroll at texas in january but he needs two four more hours at blinn so he will have to remain at the junior college through the spring semester to graduate that will delay his enrollment at texas until next fall the longhorns other early commitment are offensive linement

_________________________________________________________________________________________ the results of our survey confirmed for the management committee and me the great things you feel about enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move enron forward the following are some of the things were doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback now heres what were going to do based on your feedback stock price we are all concerned about our stock price which has declined significantly this year the primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include a decline in the overall market and economy certain enronspecific issues such as california india and recent management turnover a meltdown in the broadband sector which may have been as much as three zero four zero of our stock price at the high lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winters high and concerns over the pace of energy deregulation these concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution wholesale and retail businesses very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth and future earnings growth as has enron we fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve over the past month we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses we have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money we also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward mark koenig executive vice president of investor relations will host brown bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions he will also continue to host espeak sessions to answer employee questions greg whalley mark frevert and i will also hold discussions with various groups of employees which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide watch for these events the prc the relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives nevertheless we recognize that certain aspects of the prc may have caused some of you concern and we believe we can improve refine streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone therefore we will make the following changes to the prc process prior to yearend effective immediately relative performance discussions will occur annually at yearend however business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently the current preferred distribution will no longer be required across enron business units will be asked to identify only their top one zero and bottom one zero performers for review by enrons office of the chairman annually at yearend we will continue to use the pep three six zero degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees we will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year finally we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes in the november issue of enron business we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process in addition there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to yearend employee morale we believe the stock price our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale additionally some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns effective immediately we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their human resources hr rep we are establishing a new business function we are calling employee relations er that will report directly to the office of the chairman cindy olson will head this function more details of how this group and hr will operate will be communicated in the next few days over the long term we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles we will encourage vice presidents and above as well as other current and emerging leaders to complete executive impact influence training these sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people additionally we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via communicate which will be rolled out immediately communicate is an interactive training course that uses enron scenarios and a combination of video voice mails emails and meetings notes to analyze user performance based on a participants responses and actions external reputation we all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year the single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees we recognize that as enrons ambassadors in the marketplace the more you know about our strategy performance and challenges the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company to ensure you are better informed we will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting enron in addition to our existing communication efforts like email messages and

and will equip you with information when talking to your customers as we said before greg mark and i as well as members of our management committee will meet with groups of employees across enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges look for these to start in midoctober integrity respect i believe as i said previously we need to reinforce our core values particularly integrity and respect from what you have told us in this survey you agree enrons values will have more importance in each employees evaluation and feedback we ask that all employees regardless of level hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis we are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers we will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional specific feedback on employee issues like ethics integrity and individual concerns if you would like to participate in these focus groups please

review of contract prices california officials now argue that such provisions indicate that suppliers had undue bargaining power rather than protecting suppliers these provisions are having the opposite effect of drawing political and legal scrutinysch the state energy pacts bar state from seeking us review of prices crisis the provisions suggest the amount of clout generators had during negotiations consumer advocates want the agreements redone by virginia ellis and nancy vogel times staff writers october one five two zero zero one sacramento buried in the fine print of the longterm contracts california officials signed to buy billions of dollars in electricity are provisions giving up the states right to seek a federal examination of whether the contract prices are unreasonably high critics of the contracts call those clauses the clearest evidence yet that many of the agreements need to be renegotiated you would never find a provision like that in a contract that was negotiated under normal circumstances because its patently ridiculous said senate energy committee chairwoman debra bowen dmarina del rey it demonstrates how much clout the generators had in negotiating these contracts the federal energy regulatory commission is obligated to ensure that wholesale power prices are just and reasonable if the ferc finds otherwise it has the authority to order power sellers to refund profits in recent weeks loretta lynch president of the state public utilities commission has asked the ferc to review two of the states longterm power contracts the prices and terms of those contracts may be unjust and unreasonable lynch said neither contract had the nochallenge clause but when asked about contracts that include the prohibition lynch expressed outrage they didnt want anybody looking over their shoulder she said from my perspective that contractual provision is great evidence that the generators knew they were sticking up the state if they thought this was a reasonable contract why wouldnt they want ferc to uphold their deal states bargaining position was weak the companies with nochallenge clauses in their contracts included mirant americas energy marketing dynegy power marketing sempra energy resources allegheny energy supply co coral power and williams energy marketing trading s david freeman the states chief negotiator on longterm power contracts who was recently named head of the consumer power and conservation financing authority said the clause needed to be understood in the context of the energy crisis at the time the contracts were negotiated the states two largest utilities pacific gas electric and southern california edison had already failed to pay energy companies hundreds of millions of dollars for power purchases our reputation as a state for sticking by what we said and having credit was not all that great in january he said they were asking is this a serious deal is the state of california committed to it what are you going to sayno then youre not going to get a deal the state began a hurried effort to negotiate longterm contracts in january after energy prices on the spot market spiraled to unprecedented heights the costs threatened to bankrupt the states utilities which were unable to buy power on their own for their customers state officials negotiated dozens of contracts some lasting as long as one zero years which offered prices ranging from five eight to two four nine per megawatthoura far cry from the five zero zero per megawatthour the state was frequently paying on the spot market at the time but by summer the wild energy market stabilized and prices dropped california suddenly found itself paying more under the longterm contracts than the one five tothree zero per megawatthour offered on the spot market look at the context in which the state was entering into these contracts they were pretty much desperate said mike florio senior attorney for the utility reform network in san francisco we were talking about windfall profits taxes and seizing power plants and i think the generators started putting in their contracts anything they could think of to keep the state from undoing the deal once things calmed down which they have michael j niggli president of sempra energy resources said the clauses provided the kind of reassurance that allows the financial community to say were willing to invest in california its not that were superseding anything frankly its that weve said we dont want the party weve done the transaction with to try to derail it niggli said he acknowledged that the contract clause cannot prevent the state from asking for federal review the question becomes will ferc accept that or consider that he said and then do we consider that a breach of the contract in any way shape or form bowen and freeman predicted that the clauses would not stand up to court scrutiny frankly i wasnt too concerned about the clause freeman said i dont think its enforceable enforceable or not bowen said the clauses would complicate any state efforts to seek ferc review the very fact that they were able to get that kind of language in the contracts tells you it wasnt an evenhanded situation she said i believe the state in negotiating the contracts did the best possible job it could under the circumstances but that doesnt excuse

on this subject heres some background infoon the status of shipments to the site these shipments are of two categories ingauge cargo and outofgauge cargo as explained below one it will be recalled that upon the intervention of us ambassador indyk pm barak gave us permission to transport plant goods to gaza last october and four trailers made it to the site but fighting at the karni crossing which involved one zero israeli tanks and the first reported use by the palestinians of antitank weapons put an end to these shipments two for a second time ambassador indyk obtained approval to transport plant cargo to gaza last week from pm barak upon the recommendation of israels deputy defense minister ephraim sneh this initially applies to ingauge equipment that can be transported on a back to back basis ie at the border crossing a palestinian truck replaces the israeli truck and the license plates are also changed but the cargo stays on the same trailer then the cargo gets hauled to the project site three on monday dec two five zero zero tralires of ingauge imports from ashdod and from ik metal industry in israel will go to the site see the message from the freight forwarder below the three day muslim holiday of id alfitr will cause these transports to be interrupted next week after which they will resume four the outofgauge equipment eg gas turbines cannot be transported in this manner due to the lack of the necessary equipment on the palestinian side such equipment must go into gaza in israeli convoys with israeli heavylift equipment and israeli operators before the disturbances that started around the end of september the israelis and palestinians worked out a deal wherein the israeli army escorted the convoys to netsarim road an israeli settlement in gaza and the palestinian forces guarded the convoy from that point until it was unloaded at the site that is how the first two gas turbines were transported to the site in the present circumstances two hurdles must be overcome a israeli transportation subcontractors are apparently unwilling to entrust the safety of their equipment and personnel to palestinian forces b the israeli and palestinian forces have to work out a suitable arrangement for escorting the israeli convoys in gaza i had asked samir shawa to bring the latter issue to the attention of the palestinian authorities and he did last week however samir informed me that the palestinian officer who was working on this matter got killed accidentally samir was hopeful that the two sides will work it out until this issue is resolved it will be difficult to bring out of gauge cargo into gaza five we will continue to work with the us embassy the palestinian authorities and pec to get all plant cargo to the site we hope that the political and security situation will make this feasible i share wails concern and we are trying to use the present window of opportunity to get plant goods to the site asap we are pressuring ap and its freight forwarder to get going six today i received an email from first secretary of the us embassy john lister regarding a followup meeting between indyk and sneh last friday at this meeting sneh reconfirmed the support of the goi for this project i shall forward that email to you ed husami forwarded by ed husamienron_development on one two two four two zero zero zero zero four zero three pm josh podell

 excess power from CDWR's long-term contracts",everyone this is hot news showing that the caisocdwr relationship is even more cozy than we thought i am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and fercs attention one according to two sources the caiso is helping to bail gov davis out of his highpriced cdwr longterm power contracts by purchasing cdwrs excess energy as an out of market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the caisos supplemental energy auction as required by the caiso tariff the costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to scheduling coordinators who are largely unaware of the caisos surreptitious transactions two this sweetheart deal violates the caiso tariff which requires the caiso to buy energy from its supplemental energy realtime auction first caiso tariff dispatch protocol section eight six two d only after the caiso has used up the supplemental energy bids can the caiso buy out of market oom energy if the caiso were following the tariff cdwrs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and cdwr would be paid the clearing price for supplemental energywhich is often as low as zero zero zero therefore under the tariff the caiso could have paid cdwr the same price paid to other scs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to cdwr three by ignoring supplemental energy bids in favor of cdwr power the caiso is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the supplemental energy market low caiso demand for supplemental energy drives down prices the clearing price for supplemental energy has often been as low as zero zero zero therefore the caiso gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free if cdwr was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it four while there is no evidence that gov davis has directed the caiso to buy from cdwr first this behavior clearly benefits davis absent the caisos purchases of cdwrs excess energy cdwr would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers the media has been been making hay out of daviss strategy of buying high and selling low therefore davis and cdwr benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts of course they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the caiso five the costs of this expensive cdwr power are being passed through to unwitting scheduling coordinators who frequently seeing one zero minute ex post prices of zero zero zero expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to zero zero zero these scs are in for a big surprise according to one source at sierra pacific the caiso charged him as much as four zero zero mwh for imbalance energy where is the price mitigation here six who benefits under this scam davis and cdwr who loses under this scam instate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the caiso scheduling coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy seven sources our client representative from the caiso has confirmed this practice and the friday burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also eight here is the quote from the friday burrito there is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts the iso is utilizing the dwr contracts as out of market oom calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post beep market as one of our faithful observers told me the iso will be billing some drwcers longterm contracts to scs as oom energy this has been confirmed by the iso this means there is no realtime price transparency we may see an hourly expost price of say one five but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual realtime settlement price there is no way to estimate what the oom charge was as the iso doesnt post that information the implication is that parties buying realtime energy will wait nine zero days before theyhave any idea of the price this sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the fercs goals of creating open transparent markets nine here is the email from our caiso representative original message from

to recap our telephone discussion the charges assessed to the market in charge type four eight seven are determined by cers and are being collected by the iso on behalf of cers to cover the cost of

eight seven revelation steve here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the caiso is handling four eight seven kent at sierra power inquired to me why he was being charged four eight seven four eight seven is the charge code the caiso uses when it has to go out of market and purchase power that exceeds one five zero zero zero mwh four eight one is the charge code they use to credit it back for the same hours and intervals that both the inc and dec prices were zero this was obviously very peculiar and nobody in vm knew the answer so caroline posed the question to keoni at the caiso his response was this that the caiso is charging four eight seven regardless of the inc and dec prices to cover the forward market contracts signed by cdwr and cers in effect they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price and are in effect trying to recover costs for cdwr and cers kit,11:52:21,No

group in which an overview of the trusts damage argument is outlined and ideas exchanged about it knowing youre buried with other matters if there is any chance you could review themprint them out review and give me a call so that we can discuss id greatly appreciate it the description of what the defense group is anticipating appears to be consistent with what the trust told us in one of our early conference calls about how it was calculating damages in our case id like to know if you agree or if there are difference in what our master agreementconfirmation letters damage provisions provide i would also like to review the counterarguments that weve articulated in brief before if youd like to schedule a set time to talk over the next few days thats great let me know what works for

communication january three zero two zero zero one re pca litigationtrustees damage theory dear counsel having reviewed tims email and talking with him i reiterate my view that tim has correctly determined how the ak attorneys are going to stand up and claim that pcas inability to perform is irrelevant while i maintain that the argument leads to an absurd result namely that pca could repudiatebreach the contracts and still collect damages it may be that we need an expert to analyze the ld provisions of the contracts to aid us in our response it would be interesting to know what our clients think about this argument or what scott jones thinks of it for example can pca claim that sellers who appropriatedly demanded adequate assurance failed to schedule or deliver power when they proposed to continue to scheduledeliver once adequate assurance was posted similarly would a trading expert interpret the ld provision relating to having a sellers performance excused by pca to be limited to situations where pca and the seller were booking out or pca was otherwise making affirmative statements to the seller that delivery was not expected any thoughts regards douglas b

lobbyists gain the edge in persuading president bush a selfproclaimed free trader to take steps this week aimed at restricting imports of steel lobbyists for the us steel industry used the threat that thousands of retired steelworkers in key states would lose their health insurance if their companies closed the specter of an uprising by steel retirees who substantially outnumber active steelworkers provided a potent political argument for the industrys case that bush should take drastic action to protect us steel companies from a worldwide glut even at the cost of tarnishing his freetrade image the argument was advanced by two top republican lobbyists edward w gillespie and vin weber each of whom has been receiving four five zero zero zero a month from an industryunion coalition called stand up for steel the coalition scored a smashing victory tuesday when bush announced that his administration will file a case with the us international trade commission seeking to win authority to set quotas on steel imports and although many factors went into the white houses decision industry sources and other participants pointed to the concerns raised by gillespie and weber as a classic demonstration of how a highly motivated constituency can sway an administration that barely won the electoral college and lost the popular vote from a political perspective this was not a hard case to make to a government as closely divided as this one is said weber a former congressman in an interview eighteen steel companies are in one stage or another of bankruptcy all those retirees are facing loss of benefits only about one five zero zero zero zero people now work in us steel facilities but at some of the biggest integrated steel ma kers which are in the worst trouble financially there are about six retirees for every active worker the total number of retirees is slightly more than three zero zero zero zero zero according to industry officials adding to the political punch behind the gillespieweber argument was the fact that many of these retirees live in rust belt states that were hotly contested in the last presidential election including pennsylvania illinois ohio and west virginia the most fiercely contested state of all florida is among the top eight states in number of retirees a lobbyist who worked against the steel industry lewis leibowitz of the law firm hogan hartson ruefully gave credit to his opponents political skill leibowitz represents the consumer industry trade action coalition which consists of companies that favor free trade on the grounds that import competition helps keep costs low they did a lot obviously leibowitz said referring to gillespie and weber this is an i ndustry that has something like one six zero zero zero zero workers and the market value of all the companies is smaller than that of amazoncom and theyve turned this town upside down so my hat is off to them the administration took other considerations into account to be sure including the need to win support from steel state democrats for congressional authority to negotiate new trade agreements jim dyke a spokesman for commerce secretary donald l evans asserted that his boss was particularly moved by the pleas of union leaders who recalled how their companies had shed workers and restructured in the one nine eight zero s only to find themselves devastated anew by imports foreign steel shipments which account for about two zero percent of the us market reached record levels after financial crises in asia russia and brazil in the late one nine nine zero s factories are closing and people are losing their jobs because theres not a level playing field dyke said repeating the administrations argument t hat a major reason for the oversupply of steel on world markets is the subsidies that many foreign countries provided when they established their national industries this fits in with the presidents freetrade strategy capitalizing on the administrations decision evans joined in a news conferencerally yesterday with such top labor leaders as john sweeney president of the aflcio and leo gerard president of the united steelworkers of america both of whom backed democrat al gore in the two zero zero zero presidential race you can trust that we will be with you every step of the way until the problem is fixed evans told the cheering crowd which was reminded by other speakers that the clinton administration had balked at filing a case like the one bush intends to bring before the international trade commission the clinton administration along with a number of industry lawyers feared losing the case at the time but industry experts said another factor was the staunch fr ee trade stance of the treasury department the bush administration itself has balked at taking action that would directly protect the benefits of steel retirees the steelworkers union has called for the government to create a fund that would help cover these legacy costs but administration officials said their moves to block imports should help protect benefits by aiding the industrys revival the white house will now have to contend with the ire of us trading partners which have reacted with a mixture of indignation and restraint long tong yu chinas top trade official told a news conference at a trade meeting in zhouzhuang yesterday that although china is concerned with any protectionist practices or measures it would wait to see whether the us action conformed with the rules of the world trade organization akira chihaya president of nippon steel corp and the head of japans iron and steel federation lashed out at the united states saying he fears t he administrations move will encourage protectionism which has been spreading globally but us steel industry sources were crowing over the importance of a professed freetrade president putting his imprimatur on an ambitious initiative to save the industry he must be choking but

billions of dollars pay no inte rest reap millions in tax breaks and then wait for the debt to simply dis appear that was the promise of zerocoupon convertible bonds and companie s from enron to merrill lynch binged on what seemed like free moneytwo zero but of course there was a catch for this scenario to play out a company s stock price had to rise sharplyand quickly thats because investors b ought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equityif the stock ta nked the bonds would no longer be worth converting so to make them more a ttractive to buyers companies had to build in an escape hatch if the stoc k price failed to rise sufficiently investors could put that is sell the bonds back to the companyin many cases after just one year and thats exactly whats about to happento the tune of some six five billion over the next three years stock prices have fallen so far that for at leas t half of these special hybrids the prospect of conversion is now absurd it simply wont happen so bondholders are looking to get their money back the first chance they can and because of the put feature that is possible suddenly companies like tyco comcast and dozens more are on the hook fo r billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought theyd never have t o paytwo zero that could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies after all theyre the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt comes due huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay bondholders companies without enough cash and the majority fall into th is campare likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow money anew that means sharply reduced earnings especially at risk are inv estors in companies with poor credit ratingsprime candidates for

this is happening at a time whe n the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrin king this is a ticking time bomb warns margaret patel manager of the p ioneer high yield bond fund a topperforming junk fundtwo zero the seeds of this mess were sown in midtwo zero zero zero when the stock market started to falter companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling stock while their share prices were struggling zerocoupon convertible bo nds presented an attractive alternative because companies didnt have to ma ke cash interest payments on the bonds hence the name zero instead iss uers offered an upfront discountfor instance investors would buy a bond for seven zero zero and collect one zero zero zero when it maturedtwo zero companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed n umber of common shares but the bonds were structured so that conversion wo uld make sense only if the stock price rose significantlyin many cases b y more than five zero with that protective feature called the conversion premiu m zeros took off corporate issuers would pay no interest and once their stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels the debt would be swep t away into equity if the bonds are converted its a home run for everyb ody says jonathan cohen vice president of convertiblebond analysis at d eutsche banktwo zero that fourbagger of course depends entirely on the stock price rising if it doesnt the bondholders armed with that handy put feature can simply sell the bonds back to the company great for bondholders but not so hot for the company or its shareholders but hey what are the odds of that ha ppening cfos and ceos believe that their stock will just continue to go u p says cohen they dont worry about the bond getting puttwo zero if all this seems a little complicated thats because it is a reallife e xample should help californiabased electric utility calpine issued one bil lion in zeros in april to refinance existing debt at the time the company s stock was trading at about five five a shareseverely undervalued in the opin ion of company management we really didnt want to sell equity at that po int says bob kelly calpines senior vice president of finance so the co mpany instead opted to sell zeros setting the conversion premium at a heft y three seven two zero still with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise si gnificantly to make conversion worthwhile the bonds werent exactly a scre aming buy for investors so calpine added the put feature investors could sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase pric e eliminating any downside risktwo zero things havent exactly worked out as management had hoped the stock has si nce plummeted to two five and it now has to triple before conversion makes sens e so its looking as though calpine will be liable for the one billion in b orrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this april th eres also the refinancing cost according to kelly calpines borrowing ra te could run in the neighborhood of eight five an extra eight five million per year in cash obviously nobody plans for their stock to go down kelly says i dont think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put two zero calpines potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating i s straddling junk if you are a borderline investmentgrade company a fin ancing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the world notes anand iyer head of global convertible research at morgan sta nley the problem is there are a slew of companies with far worse credit r atings out there jeff seidel credit suisse first bostons head of convert iblebond research estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall into the junk category and others are at risk of having their ratings dow ngraded before the put date today with junk yielding

high price of junk it has eight four five million in zeros that it will probably have to b uy back this january and another four two billion coming down the pike over th e next couple of years because of slower thanexpected sales the company was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies and if solectrons credit is downgraded the zeros would slide into junk status a situation that could cost the companyand its shareholderstens of mill ions of dollars in refinancing chargestwo zero refinancing isnt the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros comp anies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bondsup to three of th e amount raised if the debt is sold back many will have spent millions fo r what essentially amounted to a oneyear loan theyre getting bad advice claims one banker who didnt want to be named look at the fee the bank er earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got intotwo zero as if those potential consequences were not scary enough shareholders can also get whacked when the bonds are first issued thats because some four zero a re bought by hedge funds which short the companys stock sell borrowed sh ares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price at the same t ime that they buy the bonds if the stock goes down the shorts make money from their position if it goes up they profit by converting the

it was issuing one eight five million in zeros two zero despite all the pitfalls the love affair with such pollyanna bonds continu es thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they pro vide in fact the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form of financing even better thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code companies c an rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than theyre act ually paying all they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest if certain conditions prevail verizon communications for instance would pay zero two five annual interest on its three billion in zero bonds if its stock pri ce falls below six zero of the issues conversion price in the eyes of the irs oddly that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction for tax purposes of seven five the same rate it pays on its regular debt wh y trust us you dont want to know that adds up to an annual deduction o f more than two zero zero million even if verizon never shells out a dime in intere st not surprisingly more than half of the zeros issued in two zero zero one contain si milar clauses its an incredible deal for them says vadim iosilevich w ho runs a hedge fund at alexandra investment management not only are they raising cheap money theyre also doing tax arbitragetwo zero so despite the enormous risks to shareholders

member ownership in excess of one five percent dissenting commissioner hebert argued that i the one five percent benchmark is arbitrary and should not be viewed as creating a binding legal requirement and ii limiting active ownership will provide a disincentive for other utilities to join the rto three the commissioners also rejected alliances compliance filing submitted to satisfy the terms of the

2001-01-26,"[""'john.shafer@enron.com'""]","[""'kenny.maltby@enron.com'""]",Re: Gas Injection Project,kenny i received a note from dave schafers office that they had received a note from you that they thought should have come to me instead of dave they were correct please take note for future emails that i am john shafer and not dave schafer now related to the essence of your email message below i am still in the process of gather information related to the california endangered species act memorandum or understanding and take authorization as agreed to by the koch oil company and the california department of fish and game on jan two one nine nine eight related to which ed attanasio has stated that such mou and permit was assigned to eott after the sale of the facilities to eott i am requesting from mr attanasio copies of the january one zero annual report that supposedly have been filed by eott with the cdfg related to activities associated with this mou i am also holding conversations with randi mccormick and ed attanasio related to the status of the usfws federal incidental take permit issued to arco western energy in march one nine nine six covering the same properties therefore my comments are somewhat cursory at this point but im getting up to speed pretty fast on this very important issue we need to thoroughly understand what agreements are in place both with the cdfg and the usfws before we do something within this protected preserve to one of these rare threatened or endangered species that we will all live to regret everything may be perfect and all agency personnel happy as a tree frog in the middle of a swamp in august but im not convinced yet that we even know what these predecessors agreed to and why some of the things i am aware of at this point the california mou and incidental take permit applies to the north coles levee natural gas fractionator plant rogas railcar facility two five zero miles of existing pipeline and one five five miles of proposed pipeline caveat is this project part of the one five five miles that has already been presented to the cdfg by koch or is this something outside that agreement also what about the us fish and wildlife service concerns over these species where is the agreement with the usfws if there is not one done a fullblown environmental impact study will have to be performed to get the section seven consultation done under the federal endangered specie act the north coles plant occupies nine zero acres right in the heart of the protected preserve california endangered species involved by the mou and permit one zero animals one shrimp one zero plants all of these are also federally endangered california protected species involved by the mou and permit two animals these are not listed by the feds take authorizations are very restricted another words if you illegally take kill harrass damage their habitat etc one of these plants or animals you go to jail and do not collect two zero zero when you pass go notices of activities to the cdfg are very restrictive and must be precisely completed prior to any ground disturbance in certain instances prior to any human intrusion into protected areas orientation and training related to the species permit restrictions etc must be done with all employees prior to entering a construction area biologist must be on hand for all activities all covers on oil drains pipes pits etc must be maintained as to prevent injury to wildlife preactivity survey work must be done before any offroad driving is done except in case of emergency mitigation permanent loss of habitat three to one temporary loss of habitat one one to one compensation provided on annual basis in advance of years activities caveat has this been done all pipe will be inspected prior to moving it if a trapped or an injured animal is discovered the cdfg is to be notified immediately all trenches are to provide an escape route for animals in steep wall trench areas lizards in areas where the bluntnosed leopard lizard are found all excavation is to be done by hand daylight work only revegetate with local stock reports during and post construction must be timely as indicated in permit all other activities regular maintenance during the year are to be reported on a january one zero report filed with the cdfg stating the effectiveness of the measures taken koch was to establish a pledged savings account or trust for the amount needed to stand behind the activities undertaken during the year until such habitat management land would be donated by koch to mitigate for the impacts that had occurred also koch was to provide an endowment to cdfg for management of any new lands donated and pay all reasonable expenses i assume this also applies to eott now that eott is the owner koch could proceed under this state permit with ground disturbance activities prior to having the acreage to donate as long as the savings account andor trust was set up and funded to cover the activities any default and the permit is rescinded and the cdfg will bring all charges both corporate and individual term two five years from jan two one nine nine eight caveat a scott clark signed this agreement on behalf of koch in one nine nine eight is this the same scott clark that now works for randy rice as you can see i only know enough about this issue at this point to be dangerous however i would caution each and every one of you to proceed with appropriate caution until we have all of the facts if we have a problem with the proposed construction or with our daily maintenance activities related to any of these species or this agreement we will need to have all the facts correctly identified and completed i am also attempting to

construction it is my understanding that they have the project on there desk and are looking at it once we receive there approval we will send a biologist out to trap for three days to see what species are in the path of construction at the same time we can put up the bond for purchase of the required compensation lands with the kern water bank authority and area energy the one zero eight one permit we have with the fish and game requires a one four day notices before start of construction with a company contact under ed attanasio guidance i sent notice of construction to the fish and game and that i would be the local contact for this project one issue that could keep us from trapping is the outside temperature if it is to cold the species will be trapped and not able to get back to there burrows and will freeze to death randi mccormick believes we will have approval in two weeks but there is not any guarantee the state works at there own pace the second issues is a stream bed alteration permit with the army corp of engineers for crossing the kern river bypass channel gary fuller had put west coast environmental in charge of getting this permit i talked with them friday and

'john.sherriff@enron.com'""]",Re: Enron OnLine/Credit Derivatives,louise thanks for forwarding preliminary response as follows i will need to follow up with sanjev at slaughter and may who is coordinating the european side one regulation we agree with the analysis securities laws will not be relevant insurance is likey to be the main issue if it emerges from our legal review of the relevant countries that we can avoid the insurance point by making our contracts look like derivatives swapsoptions that will determine whether the cftc commodity regulations will be relevant for this reason it makes sense to complete the survey before drafting the confirms which in any event will be fairly simple note though that we will not be using isda documentation since it is unnecessarily complex for the product contemplated described below and using the gtcs approach will tie in more neatly with online of course we will also need to look at local regulation in each target jurisdiction sfa for example are taking an increased interest in the internet and have recently released a detailed questionnaire which we may need to complete before launch two the product from my most recent discussions with bryan the product will be a simple bankruptcy only digital payout that is if the reference entity goes bankrupt probably as defined under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation local counsel will need to draft in each case the protection seller will pay the buyer a fixed preagreed sum of money not determined by reference to the value of a bond or anything else three bankruptcy please see two above also note that we are looking for a harder more certain definition of bankruptcy which will be relatively easy to ascertain in each case early warning type events will probably be out and court based or other formal proceedings which are readily verifiable will be in in practice this will make it harder for the buyer to claim than under the isda definition for example which is a far softer and more sensitive trigger four confidentiality ken also raised this important point when we spoke yesterday there are issues of confidentiality which will be relevant while as a matter of uk regulation a chinese wallrestricted list procedure will not be required since no securities will be involved contractual duties of confidentiality will need to be considered the issue is perhaps more a commercial one we will need to think carefully about the impact our public betting on the bankruptcy of our counterparties will or might have on our business relationships with them ill come back with a legal game plan once bryan sanjev and i have got together best regards paul louise kitchen one one one seven nine nine one zero two seven pm to paul simonslonectect john

capital trade resources corp from david gilberg gilbergdsullcromcom one seven one one nine nine two zero zero six to mark taylorhouectect cc lkitchenenroncouk raislerksullcromcom bcc louise kitchenlonect subject enron onlinecredit derivatives following up on our discussion yesterday this is to summarize the issues and questions that we identified with respect to the trading of credit derivatives through enron online one the proposal needs to be analyzed more closely from the perspective of three principal regulatory schemes securities commodities and insurance if the credit derivatives are not priced on the basis of or indexed to securities there should not be any significant securities law issues with respect to the commodity exchange act if the derivatives are executed as swaps they will need to satisfy the cftcs swap exemption and if executed as options they will need to satisfy the trade option exemption with respect to insurance there could be an issue as to whether the credit derivatives constitute insurance this determination as well will depend largely on how the derivatives are structured for example how will payment amounts be determined and will payments be tied to losses actually experienced by a counterparty two as a result of the foregoing it will be necessary to obtain more details regarding the structure of the proposed transactions will they be swaps or options what will the precise terms be and are there any draft forms of confirms that can be reviewed three it will also be necessary to determine how bankruptcy events will be defined this approach is clearly simpler than other forms of credit derivatives that include a variety of triggers such as those based on defaults under loans derivatives securities or other instruments because bankruptcy should generally be a public and objective event however in many jurisdictions it is possible for third parties to cause an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding to be commenced and even frivolous proceedings can be commenced and maintained for some period presumably the definition that is used will need to provide for some period in which the proceeding might be dismissed also the definition will need to take into account the possibility of nonus bankruptcy proceedings four we also should obtain more information on the manner in which the derivatives will be priced and the manner in which such prices will be published or disseminated to clients this goes to the issue of whether enron could be found to have breached some duty to a third party or whether that party may have a claim against enron on some other basis for example it is possible that an entity whose name is included in the list of those on which derivatives are written will claim that enron improperly used confidential information that it received about that party through a trading relationship in pricing derivatives on its credit in addition such name might claim that enron caused it injury by publishing a price for derivatives on its credit that reflected a weaker credit rating than was warranted that party might claim that by publishing such price enron caused other parties to suspend trading with it to declare defaults or to demand collateral this obviously is not generally a problem with credit derivatives because they are done privately on a onetoone basis please call

dow jonesthose who have opposed wholesale electricity price controls have been labeled as extreme freemarket ideologues who are insensitive to the practical impacts on peoples lives of high electricity prices but the most common argument against price caps has been logical not ideological price controls have never worked market participants always find a way around the rules this week the federal energy regulatory commission decided that it will have to consider at its meeting next week revisions to its june one nine price control ruling the initial price cap rule set by the california independent system operator last spring was only a few paragraphs long each successive price cap order has gotten longer though effectiveness still appears out of reach the fercs april order was two eight pages long the june order was four eight pages and now additional rules are on call to plug the new loopholes the revisions will also try to repair damage done to the market by the june order during a spell of very hot weather monday sierra pacific resources srp subsidiary nevada power had to initiate limited rolling blackouts to a small number of customers for four five minutes the company attributed the blackouts in part to the new price controls sierra pacifics chief spokesman paul heagen provided a birds eye view of the practical realities of the fercs new price cap regime power points after having a few days to look into it can you say that price caps definitely contributed to blackouts in nevada on monday paul heagen yes but first let me say that all of it was unintentional ferc was trying to do the right thing price caps were a noble effort to solve a real problem in california but on monday the market needed speed and clarity to function it had neither and that can be attributed to the price caps normally in one or two phone calls we could have got what we needed on monday we were five to six calls into it and still on the phone price caps are having the unintended consequence of dragging other states into the california morass we have this artificial environment which we are all trying to sort through pp how specifically are the caps having this effect ph there are a couple of elements the one zero premium for power sold to california is supposed to reflect concerns about credit that one zero in an open market is no big deal but in a constrained situation the seller will grab it because now its his only chance to make money also the way this is set up they look backwards they determine the price after the fact i cant think of any business in the world where you sell a product and find out later what price you sold at this had a very chilling effect on peoples willingness to sell normally a cloud cover comes in and a utility has a little extra power to sell in the realtime market normally those little five zero megawatt packets move pretty easily and thats really important for maintaining reliability with the price cap utilities hunkered down selling at nine two wasnt worth the risk they figured they might as well hang on in case they needed it also we have a voluntary curtailment program that allows us to share savings with customers who agree to curtail use if the market is say five zero zero we might pay them two five zero mwh to curtail demand but in a nine two mkt we can offer them such a small amount of money that they stay on pp have you talked to ferc about these problems with the price controls ph weve had a senior team in washington dc at the ferc since last week right away we saw another effect of the ferc order it penalizes companies like ours that signed longterm supply contracts before the order because many of those deals were done at prices above the price cap the biggest issue for us is did ferc really mean to penalize companies like us that planned ahead its longterm contracts that provide price stability its unfair to our customers to expect them to pay for longterm contracts that have been undercut by price caps if we get into a situation where we have a little extra to sell now we cant recover our costs pp with such high prices the past year a lot of small oilfired turbines have been dusted off and put into service on time for this summer traders for other southwest utilities have said that all these little turbines have been very helpful when supplies got tight earlier in the year but they werent available this week because they cost more to run than the price cap did you see the same thing ph we have some small turbines that we put in reno and the lake tahoe area in the last few months they were supposed to provide peak power but they get uneconomic in a hurry under the price cap scheme you know weve tried to isolate ourselves as best we could from the california situation and behave very independent of how california behaves so nevada is a great test case to see if price caps have an unintended effect outside of california we were able to minimize the impact on our customers monday but the situation has maximized the attention of the country on the impact of price caps by mark golden dow jones newswires two zero one nine three eight

Panel,rto week day three october one seven two zero zero one standardizing rto tariffs the morning panel focused on which transmission services should be standardized in rto tariffs across an interconnection or the entire country there were many diverse views on the panel and the staff and commissioners were somewhat more engaged in this session the panelists were ricky bittle arkansas electric coop jim caldwell american wind peter esposito dynegy rory mcminn new mexico psc glenn ross dominion resources audrey zibelman xcel energy general observations this panel had a lot less agreement than the previous panels dynegy opposes standardization of a transmission tariff and urges ferc to give strong guidance to stakeholders and then let the stakeholders work out the details of a new tariff dominion advocates a more prescriptive approach by ferc noting that stakeholders have been unable to reach agreement over the last five years excel has its own focus they want to be an itc and want to provide many of the rto services without being an rto the wind group is mostly concerned about the ability to provide generation on an as available basis the commissioner from new mexico does not want standardization does not want ferc stepping on the states jurisdictional toes and does not want new mexico ratepayers rates to go up arkansas electric coop insists that spp transmission capacity is full so if competitors want to move power through spp new transmission must first be built i am somewhat concerned that some of the commissioners may believe that tariff standardization is not necessary while the dynegy concept had merit at one time it may be too late to rely on the stakeholder process to resolve issues and it could take many months to go through the process only to have ferc in the end decide the details anyway we may want to submit comments on this issue to ferc at the conclusion of rto week what services should be standardized overall dynegy opposes standardizing tariffs but believes certain aspects of reservations should be standardized timing confirmation processing maintenance issues bus names ramping protocols assumptions for atc calculations posting times bumping rules and settlement time with regard to congestion management it should not be standardized between rtos xcel does not support a standardized tariff but urges ferc to standardize some issues such as cbm calculations reserve obligations and load balancing and penalties american wind says ferc must focus on having liquid spot markets in rtos and not worry about tariff standardization dominion cautions ferc about dynegys proposal to let the industry work out the details he says this is what happened with order no two zero zero zero and the industry was unable to work it out should ferc retain cbm ricky arkansas coop believes that the bigger the rto the less important cbm is because the rto will have enough resources internally to effectuate reserve sharing dynegy thinks cbm should be eliminated dominion thinks cbm should be retained but the rules need to be changed cbm should not be set for a year it changes on a daily basis and this should be reflected nor should cbm be standardized because needs vary region to region however because cbm is used for load the cost of cbm should be allocated to load all panelists agreed with the concept that if cbm is retained load should be required to purchase it as a service provided under the tariff network versus point to point service peter dynegy discussed the need to develop a new type of transmission service that combines the best features from network and point to point similar to transportation service offered in gas firm and interruptible peter suggests starting with the crt tariff proposed several years ago glenn dominion thinks the crt is outdated and thinks we need a new type of service but agrees that it should combine the best elements of network and point to point should all transmission service be under the rtos tariff most of the panelists said yes all service should be under the tariff but ricky bittle said there needs to be a transition period minimum of five years no more than one zero years commissioner mcminn said no he sees this as an infringement on the states jurisdiction what services need to be changed under a new rto tariff jim wind believes that the imbalance provisions must be revised so as not to penalize as available resources ricky thinks transmission expansion is the most important issue to address in a new tariff xcel urges ferc to recognize the distinction between rtos and itcs and allow itcs to design and offer their own transmission tariffs ray alvarez will circulate a summary of the afternoon panel on cost allocation please

turn withdrew scgc is withdrawing therefore my original view that we can deal with this without taking up time at the phc still stands i would like you to try to work this out by yourselves based upon my indication here as to how i will rule the bottom line is that socalgas must respond to those interrogatories seeking to clarify which settlement is its first choice it is by no means crystal clear and does impact the breadth of support for each settlement in fact id like to know sdges view on this too i think this could be done in a limited way as opposed to responses to all the interrogatories comparing the two settlements whether socalgas has breached the interim settlement by also signing the comprehensive settlement is not directly relevant to this proceeding i dont need to determine that and i dont want to expand this already farranging proceeding to include that take it to court if you want to moreover some of the questions are now moot as all prepared testimony has been lodged so please meet and confer again if you cant come to an agreement based on my views in this email then socalgas should file its opposition on the two three rd and ill rule on each interrogatory on the

this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa letwo zero prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at thetwo zero regulated retail rate they are now nearly bankrupt in

voting against the states spending budget citing a tax increase of onequarter of a cent in the states sales tax without a state budget in place essential state services cannot be done such as issuing checks to many contractors as well as to lawmakers legislative staffers constitutional officers and administration appointees civil service workers will still be able to recover their paychecks however trial courts do not appear to collect any state funds to cover payroll and administrative costs meanwhile this weeks energyrelated events and legislative highlights include events two new whistleblowers from the former san diego gas electric company came forth on thursday morning alleging further accusations of price manipulation and unsafe working conditions by duke energy these two former employees were introduced at a press conference by lt governor cruz bustamante and assembly member barbara matthews to further expand upon testimony provided by three former duke employees last week meanwhile the senate energy price manipulation select committee chaired by senator joe dunn dsanta ana will meet this upcoming tuesday and vote on contempt citations against generators mirant and enron who failed to comply with subpoenas for documents according to the committee six other suppliers of energy aes williams reliant dynegy duke and erg have until tuesday to turn over documents the state puc cancelled its continuation meeting on tuesday dealing with the suspension of the right of retail end users of electricity to acquire service from providers other than the dwr or a public entity and any other items relating to the dwrs power supply revenue bonds written letters received by the department of finance state treasurers office and the dwr all urged the puc to postpone its hearing until midaugust so that interested parties can resolve their issues state controller connell released unedited versions of four three billion worth of power contracts with one eight power generators negotiated by the governors energy consultants on monday these contracts specifically state which companies are selling energy to the state as well as at what cost the duration of the contract and from where the energy is generated further information released includes reference to millions of dollars already paid towards the longterm energy contracts in addition to the two eight million for special energy consultants to the governor connell says that the contracts were negotiated at the worst possible times for higher prices and longer periods than necessary the caliso acknowledged on monday responsibility for swings in the electrical production at a power plant owned by duke energy this is significant because duke had been the subject of allegation of market manipulation by former employees in senator dunns surprise committee hearing last week in a document to its oversight board the iso states records show that duke merely was following its orders to adjust output to help balance the statewide grid and not drive up prices governor davis announced late last friday that mark fabiani will no longer serve as one of his strategic communications consultants keeping chris lehane as his communications consultant with a salary equal to former communications director phil trounstine mr lehane will continue to provide support in addressing the states energyrelated challenges and manage all of the states agency and department public information officers as well as relinquish his sce consulting agreement for the term of his state contract
