sanders sanderswapagov subject re mapp transmission customers john sorry for the delay in responding to your email but ill do my best to answer your questions please keep in mind that my knowlege of mapps transmission charges are limited to what i have been told or read and if someone at mapp has any additional information that would be helpful they should respond or perhaps you could address your questions to them it appears that you may be confusing mapps scheduling fee with the sd fee for the cas it is confusing that they call theirs a scheduling fee also and theres two of them the cas didnt charge their sd fee in the past as that was the practice but also mapp was in the past telling cas that they shouldcould not charge their sd fee also i believe that it was for simplicity based on the assumption that if no one charged that would be the same if all charged as we were all members clearly the language in sched f now indicates that the transmission customer will pay mapps scheduling and tariff administration fee and also the cas sd fee the following is an excerpt from mapp tariff found on their home page ancillary services are needed with transmission service to maintain reliability within and among the control areas affected by the transmission service the contractor shall provide and the transmission customer is required to purchase under this tariff i scheduling and tariff administration and ii reactive supply and voltage control from generation sources in addition the transmission customer shall schedule transmission service directly with the applicable transmission provider and shall be subject to the transmission providers charges for scheduling service for each transmission provider system in which i the transmission customers resource is located ii the transmission customers load is located iii power is scheduled into the mapp region and iv power is scheduled to leave the mapp region provided that the transmission customer shall not be subject to more than one scheduling charge for a single system a transmission provider that is the local control area operator shall offer to provide through its individual openaccess transmission tariff either itself or through arrangements with other parties the following ancillary services to a transmission customer serving load within the transmission providers control area i regulation and frequency response ii energy imbalance iii operating reserve spinning and iv operating reserve supplemental the transmission customer serving load within the transmission system is required to acquire these ancillary services from the local control area operator from a third party or by selfsupply sections three one and three two list the ancillary services offered under this tariff three one scheduling and tariff administration service the rates andor methodology are described in schedule one three two reactive supply and voltage control from generation sources service the rates andor methodology are described in schedule two in regards to the examples that you have listed it would be my opinion that the act of reserving transmision does not result in a scheduling and dispatch fee it is the actual scheduling of the energy which would incur the charge transmission reserved but not scheduled on would not incur a charge if you were to schedule energy on the examples you have given then a sd fee would be charged against each of your examples if i can be of any more help please let me know thanks terry john_olsenwrcom one one zero one zero zero zero four zero five pm terry excuse me for my ignorance but it is my understanding that the original mapp f rate included scheduling fees when transacting between mapp members with mapp f being extended to the border companys interconnects again it was my understanding that the border company would charge their scheduling fee for any schedule that leftentered their control area as part of a mapp f request so that i am clear on what you are planning to do could you please tell me what charges wapa would assess for the following examples one wr reserves transmission from oahe to shercogen using mapp f two wr reserves transmission from oahe to kcplwr using mapp f three wr reserves transmission from milescity to kcplwr using mapp f thank you in advance for clearing this issue up for me john energy

four five eight bruce ill try to answer your question and clarify our current policy as you will recall wapa originally administered its own tariff and transmission was purchased directly from wapa for all of our constrained paths there wasnt a separate scheduling and dispatch fee assessed for transmission purchased under the wapa tariff as this fee was built into the transmission rate we posted atcs for all of our constrained paths miles city spc swpa now aeci and mapp schedule f was not offered for energy transfers into or out of the mapp area wapa did not charge a scheduling and dispatch fee for transmission purchased under mapp schedule f because it was not a common practice by any of the mapp members to do so a ferc ruling required mapp to offer mapp schedule f to members and nonmembers alike and to eventually open up the use of mapp f from border to border without the requirement to purchase transmission from the border company these were major changes and they occurred in steps with mapp initially offering service schedule f to everyone then offering service schedule f rates or the border company tariff across the constrained interfaces and finally using service schedule f for all transmission into out of or through mapp if less than two years in duration during the transition wapa was still responsible for posting the constrained interfaces monitoring the flows and reposting when required we charged our scheduling and dispatch fee for all requests that used service schedule f to transition across the constrained interfaces and continue to do so today now the system has evolved where anyone can purchase mapp schedule f and mapp f can be utilized to transfer e nergy into across and out of the entire mapp member system wapa no longer administers the constrained interfaces for short term transactions and mapp as the transmission provider is responsible for approving all transmission requests less then two years when that change took place mapp was approached and asked to include the sd fee as part of the mapp schedule f service fee but mapp was unwilling to take on this responsibility wapa management therefore made the decision to start separately charging a scheduling and dispatch fee for all service schedule f utilizing our transmission this was initially delayed until we were able to develop the software necessary to implement a billing program automatically if the software and programming had been available earlier wapa would have assessed the fee earlier now the programming is in place and the decision was made to proceed i hope this answers your question yes we have always charged the sd fee for mapp schedule f transactions across our constrained interfaces but have now expanded this fee to include all mapp schedule f oasis requests into out of or through our system whether they cross a constrained interface or not the fee is per oasis request per day and the fee is assessed to the purchaser of the transmission if

2000-10-24,"[""'gfergus@brobeck.com'""]","[""'richard.b.sanders@enron.com'""]",Some thoughts on options,privileged and confidential attorney client privilege richard after todays discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on options one wait for a better protective order ask harvey morris where they are on fixing the protective order that is being litigated by others if the protective order has not changed then unilaterally postpone production until it is pro better protection and more time con even with a more stringent protective order enron still questions whether the puc is entitled to financial performance data thus this option does not fully disclose all of enrons positions and the company may be accused later of simply engaging in delaying tactics under this option we file our formal objections as well two turn over the transaction data as is continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for electricity that was delivered pro puc will get the data anyway either through ferc unfair competition antitrust or price gouging litigation by turning over the data that will show profits puc might slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by seeking to depose witnesses etc con this would be waiving the legitimate question that enron has as to the pucs ability to discovery this information through a subpoena there is also a question of how confidential this data would be given the current political agenda it might also serve to whet the appetite of the puc for more enron information and discovery this option would also provide confidential proprietary information to the puc about how enron gets its competitive advantage three turn over data for outside of california and let puc get rest of data from iso and px we have told the puc we do not want to duplicate the efforts of iso and px so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give only missing data pro it would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of california data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question con without enron cost data for the california iso and px transactions the puc would not be able to arrive at what they want a profit and loss picture we would have a hard time representing to the puc that the combination of the puc data and the enron data would be all that they need to calculate the answers to request nos seven one zero four turn over everything but price this option would simple omit the price data pro it would not reveal the profit and loss information con it would not reveal the profit and loss information in other words the puc is clear that this is what they are after by giving them everything else we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and loss moreover by piecing some of it together with the iso and px data the puc might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be quite large but just not the cost or expense side five decline to produce the data we would tell harvey morris that enron has reconsidered its position for the following reasons one our firm belief that the puc is not entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking two in his latest email harvey has made it clear that the puc wants more data one nine nine nine than we discussed earlier three continued threat that if they do not like the transaction data they will come back and ask for profit and loss information that we do not believe they are entitled to four commissioner woods statement that the purpose of this investigation is to get money from market participants in the hands of consumers five investigation by the ag into activities of other market participants and the notice that other governmental agencies are cooperating who are we producing this information to and for what purpose six enron favors public disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to do so seven enron is a small player in this market and many other market participants are not involved in the process bpa etc pro this may be the only way to preserve enrons challenge to the jurisdiction of the puc to get this data moreover in the current political environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked it also makes sense to see what ferc will do with their published one one one zero zero report on investigation date under this option we file our formal objections and sit back and wait six me too upon reflection we agree with the approach taken by the other market participants we will not produce until the protective order is modified and then only data that is within the puc jurisdiction pro this makes it look like all the market participants are acting in concert and really is no different than option one above moreover if you read reliants responses they appear ready to turn over financial data if the protective order is modified terry and mike day are both out of their offices today note that williams is adopting a strategy that says the puc needs to go to superior court to enforce its subpoena this may be met with strong opposition by the puc given their california constitutional contempt authority seven move to quash before the alj here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the puc does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits before the alj pro the alj is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions it has the least procedural risks of being dismissed con reading the tea leaves we believe it unlikely that the alj will determine that the puc has no jurisdiction moreover because the puc has its own constitutionally granted contempt power the puc will take the view according to mike day that they need not go to the superior court for enforcement they will also take the view that the superior court has no jurisdiction to hear our appeal appeals have to go to the puc and those orders are appealable at the court of appeal level thus the only de novo review of our objections might be at the alj level eight file declaratory relief action in federal court in california we would claim federal question jurisdiction under the federal power act and in particular the provisions of eight two four g under which the puc issued its subpoena in part the dispute to be decided is whether the puc has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and loss information from the wholesale market the authority for this would be mississippi power light v mississippi four eight seven us three five four bright line between wholesale market regulated by ferc and the retail market regulated by states bristol energy corp v new hampshire one three fthree d four seven one one st cir one nine nine four federal question whether state agency can inquire into business and financial data in the wholesale market but found no cognizable claim pro the federal forum may be more even handed than the alj but the question is whether we can state a cognizable claim there may be greater protections from disclosure of the information as well con the puc may continue on a parallel track unless we are able to obtain injunctive relief the puc might seek discovery of the same information in the federal court proceeding we should assume that this action will trigger the strongest response from the puc andor the ag in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same information eg unfair business practice suit price gouging antitrust etc we should anticipate deposition requests for traders etc by taking this position we will clearly be conceding that if ferc asks for the data it is germane to their authority nine separate responsesstrategies for different enron entities it may make some sense to chart a different course for portland general ees and eemc and continue to produce some data from those entities pro the information provided for these entities is not likely to generate profit and loss information that would be germane to the fight we are about to engage in eg eess description of off tariff rates for example for portland general dave aamodt is out of the office and not able to

politicalpublic affairs television programs which air in state capitols currently we are in pennsylvania and ohio expanding into nj md and de the disruptive technology is this the real target of the tv show is the guest not the audience lobbyists have trouble scheduling time with politicians and regulators and when they get on the schedule lobbyists have time getting genuine intellectual focus from government decision makers we dont have trouble with either every politician and appointee wants to be on television they always say yes when they ask us what the topics will be and we mention something like telecommunications competition or electricity deregulation they want briefing material which they actually study in order to do well on television in addition by inviting journalists and radio and television commentators as members of out panel we have the same effect on them in short step one identify govt decision makers that our sponsors want to influence step two invite them on the program and in doing so develop rapport with their key staff members on the relevant issues step three send briefing materials andor give a briefing in person before the the taping step four towards the end of a show in which the newsmaker has largely been bragging about hisher policy agenda step five steer the conversation to sponsor selected topics framing the issue in such a way as to make it very difficult for the guest to resist the conclusions suggested by the host step six take the statement of support for the position we favor eg tort reform privatization deregulation tax cuts etc which by the way we almost always are able to get from the guest on the air and in addition to airing along with the airing of the rest of the show we digitize it and send it out to legislators regulators and the proper beat reporters via email making it almost impossible for the newsmaker to back off later current sponsors medical society hospital association state system of higher

various matters currently before the california puc the commission order stating that the utilities should absorb any difference between dwrs cost of power and the retail rate freeze is still technically in effect the order only applies however to the power purchased under the governors emergency order giving the state the authority to buy power the utilities have petitioned to modify the decision telling the commission that the easiest way to remedy the problem would be to vacate the order altogether but if the commission didnt want to vacate the order it would need to change the decision so that the ious dont eat any shortfalls the commission can act on the petition to modify whenever it chooses in addition it has a continuation meeting scheduled for this thursday and a regularly scheduled business meeting next week so the opportunity to act and fix the order is there if the commission wants to take it with respect to the cost of utility generation ie retained generating assets and qf contracts the commission has a set up a schedule that foresses a commission decision adopting an interim procurement charge on march two seven th there is another workshop scheduled for tomorrow to discuss the utilities proposals after which the utilities will be required to file formal advice letters with the commission those advice letters will form the basis of the process that the commission will use to ultimately arrive at a decision on the two seven th everyone participating in the workshops takes the view that customers will see a separate line item on their bills to cover the going forward costs that dwr incurs to buy power everyone participating in the workshops also takes the view that customers will be on the hook for dwrs costs and the commission will if necessary raise rates to ensure that dwr is made whole unfortunately the commission is not currently sending signals to show that it concurs with the folks participating in the workshops and until there is clarity on whether the commission will agree to pass through those costs enron and others will continue to have problems with dwrs credit as it applies to the rfp that we and others responded to last week next week begins the hearings to address the issues that commission started to examine began in the emergency hearings held over the holidays ie the utilities financial position turns proposal to net out the utilitities generationrelated revenues with the undercollection caused by the rate cap the date on which the rate has or will end etc recently turn modified its testimony in response to the passage of abone x turns new position is that the commission should find that the rate freeze ended on february one st the effective date of abone x ees will need to quickly determine how and if it wants to respond to turns latest stance on the end of the rate freeze we continue to try to persuade stakeholders and the commission that da customers must be compensated for the fact that they paid for the utilities stranded generating assets that compensation could come in one of two forms one access to a proportionate share of the utilities retained costbased generating assets or two a credit representing the difference between the market value of the retained generating assets and the book value of those assets we are not getting much traction thus far the commission is scheduled to issue a separate decision addressing the rate freeze issue the issue of whether to net out generatingrelated revenues against the undercollection etc on march two seven so both sets of issues the procurement charges and the end of the rate freeze are scheduled to be finalized on march two seven albeit in separate orders with respect to the block foward issue our lawyers had a pretty good meeting on friday with the dwr general counsel and other dwr lawyers however it has become clear that despite those efforts fercs decision on charge backs will have a significant

position on com ed summary we discussed a public position of no ppo without an rto since without a functioning market enron is at risk with our current book of business from a public policy standpoint we would argue that without the protection of the ppo customers need a functioning market in which to procure power privately in exchange for supporting the com ed proposal we would negotiate for the following in order of importance one no losses on our existing book of business by negotiating a bulk power deal to cover our exposure two build a broad market by seeking changes to com ed ferc tariffs as it regards balancing and penalties etc as a separate matter or in conjunction with the above do a default service or some other related deal a meeting is scheduled for friday with chuck

met with frank clark senior vp exelon government affairs etc and arlene juracek vp rates and tariffs sue and i also met with commissioners hurley and harvill information gleaned from the meeting one com ed does not think price volatility will be acceptable to the residential customers and wants to create a structured rate they are not open to any alternative that causes them to lose money two they will file a rate case in two zero zero four to be effective in two zero zero five they are not sure the statute requires them to file an mvi plus one zero at the end of the ppo period and need to study the statutory requirements their preference is to initiate performanced based ratemaking instead for bundled rates three com eds view is that the energy situation is a national problem com ed wants to be protected through its commodity price four com ed does not want the obligation to serve industrial customers and on a longer term basis would like to shed its obligation to serve residential five com ed has arbitrarily defined mass market as four zero zero kw or less and has therefore lumped these commercial customers in with their residential however they are open to separating them out six com ed does not want the legislation reopened which may provide us with some leverage at the conclusion of the meeting it was decided to start an open forum process to get ideas on the table com ed is shying away from any formal process their concern seems to be that they do not want to take the political heat for high prices and volatility and would rather give up its default customer service obligations possible deal opportunities one either through negotiations preferred choice or through competitive bidding become the default service provider for some or all of com eds industrial customers this would allow us to upsell additional products to the industrial class two segregate the commercial customers one zero zero four zero zero kw customers from the residential customers and negotiate to become the default service provider three joint venture between ena and new power to be the default service provider for portions of the residential class through an optout program like municipal aggregation or some other format next steps one mark ulrich is to complete an analysis of the com ed proposal in terms of its impact on our current book of business two develop a position boiled down to just a few key points that we can push with regulators and com ed in a conference call with harry mark roy sue and me we have tentatively distilled the list to the following a default deal for industrial customers b negotiate for com ed to provide load following and balancing c default deal for commercial as opposed to pbr janine,04:44:00,"Yes,

importance high matt i thought id respond for diann the decision is pretty clear on this as you recall the issue was raised by uccsu who specifically mentioned that the utilities were unilaterally setting deadlines for submission of customer names and dasrs let me quote section f p one nine in its rehearing application uccsu seek clarification on whether dzero one zero nine zero six zero s prohibition of any new contracts for direct access services after september two zero two zero zero one allows or requires utilities to refuse to process dasrs for an account under a preseptember two zero contract ptwo zero we reaffirm that for the time being and unless the commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision utilities are required to process dasrs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before september two zero two zero zero one including dasrs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those dasrs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service ptwo one for purpose of utility compliance with dzero one zero nine zero six zero we want to make it clear that unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequent commission decision utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process dasrs relating to contracts excuted on or before september two zero two zero zero one matt these are just the highlights the decision has more language providing additional clarity by the way this decision was mailed on october one two after your october five deadline i think the decision is crystal clear you must accept all dasrs for contracts signed on or before september two zero and you cannot set artificial deadlines after which you will not accept those dasrs so given the above can you please explain your position regarding the novemver one date you may remember the rule two two meeting held by the utilities esps and customers in eaarly october the esps agreed to make a good faith effort to provide a complete customer list by november one with the understanding that additional names and facilities could be added later with some verification process

texas seven eight seven five five phone five one two seven nine five eight five three six simms working as first team qb horns get pledge from tyler db sophomore qb chris simms worked with the first team during tuesdays practice and if past practices mean anything that is a pretty good sign that he will start saturday night against houston simms worked with the first team prior to the opening game and he got the start junior major applewhite worked with the first team prior to the stanford game and he got the start coach mack brown wont say who will start at quarterback but it doesnt make a lot of sense to have your starting qb working with the second team so it looks like simms will get his second start saturday simms is more mobile than applewhite who underwent offseason knee surgery and he also led the horns to their first touchdown saturday at stanford despite only getting one four snaps to applewhites five eight applewhite led the longhorns to their other two touchdowns but they were both in the fourth quarter brown also said he has told his players and coaches that the texas fans who are being super critical of the team on the internet and on radio talk shows are hurt thats the way we feel too our players are hurt and our coaches are hurt none of us want to lose and it hurts us to go that far and play that hard and still lose because of mistakes at critical times but he said the coaches and players are working hard to get the offense rolling again and shore up the punting team after stanford scored a touchdown on a blocked punt brown said he was amazed at some critics who said the team was lining its punter up shorter than usual hes one three yards back just like every other team in the country and we try to get the punt off in two one seconds or less he got the one that was blocked off in one nine seconds but a kid who blocked it perfectly on the other one one punts let his guy come through untouched and it got blocked the longhorns may have some other punts blocked but my sources tell me brown chewed so hard on the kid who let the guy through that he will never make that same mistake again folks i guarantee you brown his assistants and his players are more upset than any of you over the happenings at palo alto and they are working hard this week to correct things remember the guy the stadium was named after was a great coach and he had two perfect seasons in two zero years at texas bobby bowden is a pretty good coach too and his perfect season at florida state last year was his first one tb hodges mitchell was lining up deeper than usual against stanford and the coaches have corrected that brown also said backup tb victor ike will play more saturday than he has been playing and he said redshirt freshman kenny hayter also might see considerable action were going to play as many as it takes brown said we have to get our running game going better he also said lg derrick dockery might be able to return to fulltime duty saturday he has been able to play on sparingly after being hospitalized for an infected cyst that would help us a lot he said derrick is one of our top offensive linemen defensive coordinator carl reese also said redshirt freshman dakarai pearson will start at strong safety saturday in place of lee jackson who has a pulled hamstring and will miss the houston game reese said pearson has a lot of talent but he said jacksons experience will be missed reese also said he will look at freshman nathan vasher and juniors ahmad brooks and ervis hill to replace pearson in the longhorns nickel and dime packages he said the team will play with five and six defensive backs a lot saturday because houston will throw it about five zero times another recruit commits texas has one six commitments now after getting a pledge from tyler cb aaron ross six one one eight two four four two ross had offers from alabama arkansas baylor lsu oklahoma texas am and others but said he committed to texas because ive always been a longhorrn fan and i really like the texas coaches he said darryl drake and everett withers were the two texas coaches who recruited him and he said withers the texas secondary coach came to see him play in his second game this season he is a big fast corner with long arms but dont look for him to get many interceptions this year because he hasnt had a pass thrown in his direction all year

more importantly whether we can have the bonds governed by texas law can you answer this for me also with respect to the form of the bond itself as we mentioned at the meeting the language in the third paragraph which states that if the principal shall promptly and faithfully provide the firm energy as defined in the confirm hen this obligation shall be null and void does not work for us has anyone come up with alternative language finally with respect to the notice of claim we would like for the certification to say something like an event of default has occurred under the master

against the hud officials and seek monetary damages this ruling although unusual by todays standards harks back to another early legal tradition the idea that citizens can hold government officials personally liable for improper conduct in one seven six three john wilkes a member of britains parliament was the subject of an outrageous search and seizure warrant issued by secretary of state lord halifax after wilkes published an anonymous attack on the government wilkes then sued halifax and other officials and was awarded a sum comparable to two zero million today americans were so enraptured with this refutation of unrestrained government power that they made wilkes a hero and followed in his footsteps suing government officials for unreasonable search and seizures since the one nine th century however this commonlaw tradition has nearly withered away the creation of the exclusionary rule has replaced wilkess remedy with an inferior one while the exclusionary rule brings some satisfaction to criminals who are the subject of unreasonable searches and seizures it does nothing for the innocent furthermore the two zero th century has seen the rise of the doctrine of qualified immunity which the us supreme court explains seeks to ensure that government defendants reasonably can anticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability by attaching liability only if the contours of the right violated are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right the ninth circuits recent ruling that hud officials were not acting reasonably when they violated the first amendment rights of the berkeley three is refreshing because it rekindles the idea that civil liability can be a restraint on government power in an era when bureaucratic violations of the rule of law have become routine it is an idea long overdue for the ninth circuits opinion see httpwwwindependentorgtiilighthouselhlinktwo three nine one html

jrthurmanequivacom subject grandfathered facilities endangered species with no prospects o f protection the days of grandfathered facilities in texas are numbered this does not only mean those large facilities in nonattainment areas but any facility that was constructed prior to september one nine seven one and has not subsequently been rolled into some sort of new source review nsr permit or permit by rule formerly standard exemption note that proposed new rules recently published in the texas register for public comment will require operators to be able to produce documentation of applicability and compliance for all facilities authorized by a permit by rulestandard exemption much the same as is required for any other type of permit the tnrcc sunset bill contains language limiting the time that such facilities may operate without nsr authorization of some sort the senate committee substitute scs for hb two nine one two is a little stricter than the version passed by the house but both versions did contain grandfathered facility permitting provisions and it is safe to assume that the final version will also if this version passes you will have one additional year to apply for a voluntary emissions reduction permit verp if your facility is a pipeline facility the tnrcc will require no more than a three zero reduction in nox and that reduction can be averaged for several facilities in the same area covered in one permit note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists particularly cindy morphew of txoga and celina romero of atingp that it looks as though we will get an additional opportunity to get these facilities permitted without having to use todays bact this memo summarizes the scs provisions for your information this is not actual bill language ive tried to make it easier to read note that these provisions may be changed somewhat if the house does not concur in all of the changes made by the senate and the bill goes to conference in addition we expect a strong attempt to amend the bill on the senate floor to require shutdown on september one two zero zero one of grandfathered facilities that do not have a pending permit application if that attempt is successful the opportunity to apply for a verp will be gone on september one the memo also recaps previous recommendations to you regarding the current opportunity to claim historical permits by rule standard exemptions as a means of permitting a grandfathered facility i am not certain how long this opportunity will continue to exist take advantage of it while you can in addition ive appended some information on one zero year old bact for gasfired ic engines and turbines that might be useful if you are trying to get a verp now provisions of scs for hb two nine

electric generating facility permit special provisions for permitting grandfathered electric generating facilities are not outlined in this memo sec three eight two zero five one eight six authorization for pipeline facilities a the commission by rule shall establish the procedures for applications for grandfathered processing treating compression or pumping facilities connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline b based on a prioritization by the commission as necessary to meet local regional and statewide air quality needs related directly or indirectly to federal air quality standards the commission may require up to a three zero reduction of the hourly emission rates of nox and voc from reciprocating internal combustion engines subject to this section for facilities other than reciprocating internal combustion engines that are connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline the commission may consider requiring hourly emissions rate reductions of up to three zero for nox and two zero for voc the commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate will be required than in other areas but no more than three zero percent reductions in the hourly rate may be required in any area c the commission shall one allow for a single permit for all facilities connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline two allow for required reductions for facilities under this section to be achieved at one facility or averaged among more than one facility and located in the same local regional or statewide areas designated by the commission under subsection b three for purposes of emission averaging allow emission reductions achieved from grandfathered since september one one nine nine seven and four allow an owner or operator to apply for separate permits under this section for discrete and separate facilities connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline d facilities authorized by this section shall be considered permitted under this chapter current opportunity to claim a permit by rule to permit a grandfathered facility tnrcc has interpreted its rules to allow operators to permit grandfathered facilities using any applicable permit by rule including those previously referred to as standard exemptions for instance old standard exemption seven effective may eight one nine seven two was for gas fired internal combustion engines of less than two zero zero zero hp and engine trains of less than five zero zero zero hp total and can be used to permit any such engines for clarification on this particular exemption the language used by staff in proposing this exemption to the texas air control board in one nine seven two was as follows engines smaller than two zero zero zero hp are quite numerous and are not considered a substantial source unless joined together in series emphasis added to form an engine train engine trains of less than five zero zero zero hp are not considered a substantial source because control technology for nox emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is very limited it is doubtful if significant control could be achieved through the permit system at this time exemptions from permits procedures and justification for exemptions signed charles r barden pe executive secretary texas air control board may eight one nine seven two a list of the historical standard exemptions is available on the tnrcc website at httpwwwtnrccstatetxusairnsr_permitsoldselistindexhtml httpwwwtnrccstatetxusairnsr_permitsoldselistindexhtml in applying these permits by rule be sure to check the corresponding exemption preambles if any for any applicable general conditions tnrcc has asked that we document such permitting of grandfathered facilities by pieight and a simple notification cover letter to them so that they will have a record that the facilities have been permitted and are no longer considered to be grandfathered the registration will buy you a letter of acknowledgement that you have claimed the permit by rule dont use the term exemption in any correspondence for

would be acceptable in a casebycase review when the two to eight ghphr nox level could not be achieved a large two stroke engine that is currently emitting approximately two nine ghphr of nox would be considered to have significant emissions reductions if actual emissions are reduced by five zero percent even though it does not meet the two to eight ghphr nox level we would agree that this would have been considered bact one zero years ago if there was test data to validate the old premodification and new postmodification emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved also needed in the casebycase review would be a representation of what the cost of the controls would be with a discussion of why the two to eight ghphr nox level could not be achieved this may be due to technical limitations such as no additional controls or modifications are possible or you may identify cost in dollars per ton of nox controlled to show that even though

four eight austin texas seven eight seven six seven re permitting grandfathered internal combustion engines and turbines dear ms romero as discussed in our meetings and teleconferences concerning the options for grandfathered internal combustion engines and turbines we have agreed that some of these facilities may qualify under standard exemption nos six or eight two effective on december one one nine seven two and others may be permitted under three zero texas administrative code tac chapter one one six subchapter h voluntary emission reduction permits verp specific questions raised are discussed below you have asked for our understanding of what qualifies as an engine train of less than five zero zero zero hp in your november one two zero zero zero letter you gave two examples of engine trains that you felt would meet standard exemption no six gas fired internal combustion engines of less than two zero zero zero hp and engine trains of less than five zero zero zero hp total we agree that several engines each less than two zero zero zero hp can be combined into a train providing compression to a common header so long as the train does not exceed five zero zero zero hp meet the exemption requirements in cases where the total horsepower in a train exceeds five zero zero zero hp we will allow exemption of individual engines within such a train provided that each engine is less than two zero zero zero hp and the total horsepower of exempted engines in the train does not exceed five zero zero zero hp in the same standard exemption list turbines were covered by standard exemption no eight two gas turbines of less than two zero zero zero zero hp burning sweet natural gas the other major point of discussion has been the determination of one zero year old bact required by three zero tac oone one six eight one one three a as we discussed our review of permitting one zero years ago reveals that very few if any old engines were permitted so no data is available to show what we would have required for nitrogen oxides nox best available control technology bact new engines were permitted at two gramshorsepowerhour ghphr of nox for both rich burn and lean burn engines at that time older rich burn engines could have been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this two ghphr limit for nox lean burn engines were and are still more problematic as both two stroke and four stroke versions are available and no single method of control is applicable the large number of different engine manufacturers and the availability of various models makes it impossible to establish a single one zero year old bact level some of the older engines may be capable of being upgraded to meet a level of nox of five to eight ghphr the level established in the one nine nine two revision of standard exemption no six which also established a three ghphr standard for turbines while the standard exemption does not establish bact for upgrades it does recognize what is available many of the grandfathered engines are large and some have emissions as high as two five to two nine ghphr so significant emission reductions may be achievable even if they are not able to reduce to the emissions control level of two to eight ghphr the one zero year old bact review on these engines and turbines will have to be done on a casebycase basis just as we would have done one zero years ago we hope this guidance will allow your members to decide which engines they will be able to either exempt or permit under the verp program and submit their letters of intent to participate in the verp program by december seven two zero zero zero for engines and turbines that your members decide to propose for authorization under standard exemption nos six and eight two please identify the specific engines and turbines identified by unit number emission point number epn air quality account number and plant name and for each account please submit a form piseven for each engine or turbine please submit a table two nine or three one as applicable and other technical information that will support the standard exemption claim for engines that will be authorized by a verp permit please identify each engine by unit number epn air quality account number and plant name and provide an estimate of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a result of participation in the verp program when the verp applications are submitted information should be provided to show that nox emissions will be in the two to eight ghphr range if it is not possible to achieve this level of emissions please submit information that shows that it is not technically feasible or economically reasonable to control nox emissions to that level information showing that actual emissions reductions will be achieved even when the targeted range of two to eight ghphr cannot be met will be helpful in staff review of the application we appreciate your assistance in

june one three new york times featured an extensive article on the dangers of stock options the hidden cost of stock options may soon come back to haunt as the times pointed out options carry significant costs especially in a declining or stagnating stock market how companies must buy back millions of their own shares to offset the stock they have dispensed to employees at much lower prices in options programs the rationale being that if companies did not repurchase their stock there would be so many shares on the market that the companys earnings on a pershare basis would plunge

year in stock buyback programs but in reality stock options are not as outofcontrol as the new york times would have you believe companies need to get shareholder approval for their stock option grant

their attractiveness in a tight job market salaries would jump and with that inflation then interest rates then economic downturn we all need to root for the continued appeal of options even with its quirky accounting treatment look at the global spread of stock options many countries now view options as the core of the us economic expansion and business spirit companies must learn to stop

brumberg is an attorney and the editorinchief of mystockoptionscom a new website that will be publicly available soon vc question of the week question how do i value options in a private company answer if your company is private then you should look at recent grants of options to new employees or at a recent financing round typically options are granted at fair market value so you will be able to figure out the difference between the exercise price of these recent grants and your exercise price remember you also need to consider the future growth of the company which is greater on a

the memory memory pharmaceuticals corp httpwwwmemorypharmcom hopes to become a major player in the biotechnology business by treating the symptom of memory loss in diseases such as alzheimers and parkinsons the columbia university startup could well become the next industry star the population memory is addressing is huge almost half of all americans over eight five suffer from alzheimers disease according to the chicagobased alzheimers association and by the year two zero five zero the number of americans afflicted by alzheimers is expected to rise to eight million double the number at the end of the two zero th century alzheimers is a slow killer it can take anywhere from three to two zero years for a patient to die after being diagnosed the association said as a result the cost to the healthcare system of keeping an alzheimers patient alive and functional can be extremely high companies that can help lessen the impact of alzheimers are considered extremely valuable to the healthcare system and the afflicted patient memory is developing a unique drugprofiling platform to create therapies for learning and memoryrelated disorders called cognostics the platform identifies cellbased and physiological assays in an effort to treat the symptoms of mild to moderate dementia inability to learn and memory loss caused by alzheimers parkinsons and potentially downs syndrome and epilepsy cognostics identifies drugs that treat the symptoms not the disease itself memory plans to develop drugs inhouse and to create others through partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies memorys larger goal however is to develop a product that will curb or prevent memory loss in the greater population a potentially giant market considering the buying power of the eight three million us baby boomers it is a market that has not gone unnoticed by others today many other small companies such as american biogenetic sciences inc abs neotherapeutics inc neot and helicon therapeutics and large pharmaceutical firms such as pfizer inc pfe shire pharmaceuticals group plc shpgy and johnson johnson jnj are also looking for similar treatments but memory officials believe that the competitors might become allies especially if the company can develop and test its platform first selling memoryenhancing drugs to graying populations worldwide the technology behind memory is impeccable eric kandel a professor at columbia universitys center for neurobiology and behavior and walter gilbert harvard university professor and nobel laureate started memory in the mid nine zero s

government ethics office which couldnt be reached for comment yesterday has yet to officially grant mr rove a certificate of divestiture which would allow him to roll his proceeds into diversified

imagine the news stories a few years from now crisis hangover energy stocks sink as prices plunge but california consumers still stuck with high bills the energy industry is suffering its worst downturn since the supply glut of the one nine nine zero s as dozens of big new power plants come on line and the justcompleted alaskan gas pipeline sends natural gas prices to their lowest levels in six years the one bright spot for texas generators is california where consumers are locked into longterm contracts for wholesale electricity that the state signed at the peak of its blackouts in the summer of two zero zero one sacramento lawmakers have appealed to president daschle to help get the state off the hook arguing that california will never claw its way out of its economic slump if businesses continue to flee to states where energy is cheap but top enron lobbyist gray davis a former governor of california warned daschle that suppliers would have little choice but to go to court to enforce the contracts the state signed washington and sacramento are agog with the energy crisis and bursting at the seams with plans to fix it but the one thing no one even environmentalists suggests is letting high energy prices discourage energy consumption or encourage new supplies to economists letting the price rise is the solution said paul portney president of resources for the future a washington think tank to elected representatives having the price go up is the problem political memories tend to be selective and short but it was the energy glut of the one nine nine zero s that contributed to californias blackouts three gasoline and four zero zero amonth heating bills likewise high prices are now laying the seeds of their own destruction as a story in the new york times

of the one nine nine zero s there was a glut of energy fuel of all kinds was really cheap how cheap adjusted for inflation as cheap as in one nine four nine economists calculate energy is the oxygen of the economy and rockbottom prices contributed to the long economic boom but low prices also caused energy production to slump and consumption to soar people ditched their economy cars for suvs houses got bigger ceilings got higher and kitchens sprouted industrial stoves with enough btus to melt aluminum stores offices and homes turned into summertime refrigerators low prices discouraged energy development oil was so cheap for so long that people were selling their refineries portney said you had virtually no exploration for new natural gas when prices were at two a btu as demand

representatives of some of the worlds largest banks like citibank abn amro and bank of america will be at the meeting indian lenders like the industrial development bank of india state bank of india and icici will also participate market analysts speculate that the meeting will attempt to forge a joint stand on supporting the project which now produces seven four zero mw of power and is slated to increase it to two one eight four mw shortly in its second phase but it comes against a backdrop of rising tension between dabhol and the indian state utility the maharashtra state electricity board mseb which is the sole buyer of dabhols electricity indian lenders who have lent the bulk of the funds to the plant want to continue supporting the project but they are being opposed by offshore lenders who want to withdraw their loans loans of around six three eight million of the offshore lenders are covered by guarantees provided by indian institutions the indian lenders fearing for their profitability if the foreign banks pull the plug plan to oppose any such move but they have been forced on the backfoot by msebs decision last week to stop buying power from dabhol and terminate its one nine nine five contract with the company under which it agreed to lift the entire output the mseb has complained that dabhol produces costly power while dabhol has blamed mseb for defaulting on payments worth four eight million last month dabhol issued a preliminary notice to terminate its contract to sell power it has also filed for arbitration in london this provoked mseb to haul dabhol

to dabhol power company six five percent owned by enron the two one eight four mw power project is indias largest foreign investment at two nine billion prabhu has vowed to take indian reforms in a new direction absolutely he said in reply to a question whether indias reforms have entered a different phase the power ministry will now also focus on power distribution he added besides its early preoccupation with generation needs in india unfortunately for the last one zero yearsreforms policy was skewed in favour of generation he said we never really realised that distribution is the more important part of the process prabhu added we have now decided we will make enough structural changes in distribution so that at the end of distribution enough investment is made chartered accountant a chartered accountant prabhu hails from the verdant regions of indias western coastal strand and chaired a cooperative bank that was one of the countrys largest in terms of deposits before his foray into politics an errant lock of hair straying across his forehead prabhu eschews the indian politicians traditional uniform of starched white handspun cotton for the shirtsleeves and trousers preferred by the professionals who have entered government and whom local media call technocrats prabhu said india has decided to allow private producers to sell power direct to consumers lifting curbs that have hobbled the countrys decadeold reform effort he said the question of power affordability had spurred him to ask indias states to permit thirdparty sales of power which analysts have called a stumblingblock for foreign investment they cannot force a generator to sell power only to the sebs and thats a major change we are trying to make prabhu said referring to the states sebs or state electricity boards are owned by the state governments and supply power to most of india india estimates that one zero zero zero zero zero mw of fresh capacity will have to be installed over the next one two years to meet its power needs most of the two zero zero billion in funds that will be required will have to come from foreign private investment but indias spotty reform record over the

signs of slippage in the reforms and standard poors has expressed worries over indias budget deficit prabhu said he wants to overhaul state power utilities by introducing standard accounting policies cutting transmission and distribution losses to one five percent and tackling crushing debt thus helping to lure foreign investment into the sector the poor financial health of the utilities expected to run up combined losses of about six billion in the two zero zero one zero two fiscal year has proved a hurdle in efforts to draw private investment prabhu said an expert panel examining ways to restructure seb finances looking at technical commercial and tariff issues is expected to report within a few weeks for the first time we will be preparing commercial data which is internationally accepted we will be preparing technical data which is internationally appreciable and thirdly well be creating an information base which will be created by experts and then made available to the states he said the utilities transmission and distribution losses run to up to two five percent of the electricity they generate compared to a figure of about eight percent internationally he said

president slams us energy firm enron for poor performance zero six zero four two zero zero one bbc monitoring source the guardian web site lagos in english four jun zero one bbc monitoringc bbc text of article by francis obinor entitled obasanjo chides enron on lagos power project published by nigerian newspaper the guardian web site on four june for failing to live up to expectation of the nigerian government and the people as regard its role in the independent power project ipp initiated by the lagos state government two years ago enron the american firm got a hard knock from president olusegun obasanjo at the weekend two three june in his conclusion obasanjo accused enron a major player in the electricity project of poor performance and bad faith ostensibly angry at the delay in the projects full takeoff and the three zero mw recently connected to the national grid from the scheme the president on the american cable news network cnn declared enron has played a dirty game on us dirty game in two ways beside putting up an exorbitant price the company according to the president also failed to comply with the terms of the contract continuing obasanjo said the price at which they enron have tried to sell power to us has been very exorbitant two what they told us they would do they have not done while refusing to disclose the firms charges enron vicepresident of marketing john ambler said the primary objective of the company was to get the project on stream we have a project that is very close to coming on line he said stressing that the companys desire is to see the project work effectively in nigeria especially in lagos he added that enron is committed to the ipp and assured lagosians that they would soon begin to feel the impact the state government brought forward the june two zero zero one deadline it set for the commencement of the first phase of the project when it fired the first three zero mw of electricity to the national grid two weeks ago at the government house on two three may governor bola tinubu said his administration and the contracting firm felt that there was no harm in bringing the date forward and assured that another three zero mw would be added soon he noted that contrary to expectations that the project would cover the entire state at a go it would be in phases and the focus for now would be industrial consumption the concentration for now is not as private homes we would soon get there tinubu assured the controversial ipp programme which the federal government had at one time been accused of frustrating has suffered several setbacks including enrons initial plan to sell its shares to aes another american company last april was originally fixed for the projects takeoff but the failure of trevi a construction company in charge of transmitters caused a shift in the date copyright two zero zero zero dow jones company inc all rights reserved india india and bush administration beyond assumptions zero six zero four two zero zero one business line the hindu copyright c two zero zero one kasturi sons ltd ksl source world reporter tm asia intelligence wire soon after mr george w bush jr won the us elections indian observers proclaimed quickly that a republican administration bodes good for india a republican administration was expected to not pester india about human rights violations in kashmir not force it to sign the ctbt and get tougher with china mr george bushs decision to drop by the external affairs minister mr jaswant singhs meeting with the american national security advisor ms condoleezza rice seemed to somehow confirm this false sense of euphoria this narrow thinking fails to understand the drivers of republican ideology the reality is the republicans care about a range of issues that will force the bjp government to make some difficult decisions take the first issue of human rights violations in kashmir it is true there are many isolationists in the republican party who probably do not care about human rights violation in kashmir so long as it does not affect them and is not happening in their backyard but there is another powerful force in republican politics the religious wing this includes powerful members of the us cabinet such as the attorneygeneral mr john ashcroft who are christian fundamentalists mr bush himself claims to be a born again christian the religious right is rarely interested in foreign policy it mostly concerns itself with moral and social issues such as abortion and teenage pregnancy but the few times it does intervene it is when it feels a country is persecuting christians and when it does intervene no republican administration dares cross it for instance china is periodically identified as a country that persecutes christians christian missionaries and ministers are routinely harassed and imprisoned because they are trying to spread their religion because of this issue republican members of the christian right in congress have all but declared a religious war on china routinely opposing any attempt to improve relations including trade relations with that country india as an emerging power is more carefully watched and frequently mentioned in the american press stories of christian missionaries being burnt alive and nuns raped are attributed to elements associated with the hindu fundamentalist ruling party in its latest human rights report the us state department noted these acts with concern the popes mention of these issues to the prime minister mr atal bihari vajpayee was also noted in the american press india is perhaps half a step away from being branded as a country that persecutes christians a selfprofessed bornagain christian like mr george bush would quickly take up the christian rights cause trumping all other bilateral issues human rights may not matter to the isolationists but christian and to a lesser extent jewish religious freedom matters tremendously to a republican administration the second fallacy was that since the republicans in congress did not pass the comprehensive test ban treaty they would not force other countries to pass the ctbt either but why are the republicans are opposed to the ctbt the opponents of the ctbt feel that it fails to safeguard american security they frankly care little about indian security they would love to be able to restrict indias ability to test and use its weapons to them nuclear weapons not in american hands translates into an unsafe world unless india manages to convince the republicans otherwise the republican administration is likely to tighten the antiproliferation screws on india the third fallacy relates to a tough longterm strategic realignment the bush administration will demand of india mr bushs foreign policymakers are unreconstructed cold warriors in the postcold war era they are desperately searching for an enemy they appear to have settled on china as the next enemy their next step is to search for allies who rarely challenge their views thinkers in washington and new delhi believe that india and the us are natural allies but such a decision has an enormous range of longterm consequences for india to discuss just a few most of the indian militarys equipment comes from russia and the former soviet union allying with the us will be seen by the russians as abandoning them and this could have an enormous impact on the legacy military equipment recent noises from the foreign ministry suggest india is also eager about mr george bushs proposed missile defence programme but this technology is far from proven and during the decade over which it may be developed if it gets past congress china will most certainly develop many nuclear weapons these may primarily be a deterrent against the us but it will force india into an arms buildup it can barely afford the americans are reserving their missile defence system for their closest allies india today is neither fish nor fowl not quite a threat but not quite an ally either it is unlikely that india will be able to convince the americans to give it the defence system even if the americans agree to sell it to india it could never afford the sticker price so before it rejoices at the notion of antichina hawks in the white house let india ponder over the unexamined consequences the final issue is one that may precipitate in the very near term enron and maharashtra find themselves in a dispute that neither wants to lose and that appears to be rapidly getting shriller mr george bushs background is as a texas oilman and he is widely accused in the us of being beholden to the interests of the energy industry in fact they were among the biggest contributors to his campaign the enron chairman mr kenneth lay is a friend of mr bushs and was seriously considered for a job in his cabinet he is so well connected that he was recently accused of influencing who is appointed by the white house to regulate the energy industry in the near term mr bush could quite possibly lean heavily on new delhi to make sure that enrons interests are not neglected if new delhi does not respond to his satisfaction his opinion of india and consequently his administrations dealings with the country are likely to be coloured far more than we think giridhar srinivasan copyright two zero zero zero dow jones company inc

motion to intervene the aga petition raises issues that are directly related to the operation of pipelines two enron operates a number of interstate pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the commission under the natural gas act in some cases these pipelines are whollyowned subsidiaries in other cases enron is a part owner these interests are collectively referred to herein as the enron interstate pipelines the enron interstate pipelines have currently pending order no six three seven compliance filings and may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding and thus have a direct and substantial interest in this proceeding that cannot be adequately represented or protected by any other party thus the enron interstate pipelines participation is in the public interest iii comments the enron interstate pipelines wholly support the response of the interstate natural gas association of america filed this day and incorporate the comments made therein like ingaa the enron interstate pipelines take issue with both themes of the aga petition first the enron interstate pipelines take issue with the procedural request to implement the new capacity release timeline separately from order no six three seven proceedings or gisb compliance filings second the enron interstate pipelines wish to once again voice concerns about the farreaching impacts of the flowing day recall rights that the aga petition advocates rather than repeat those concerns again here we have attached a copy of comments that were submitted to the gisb executive committee during the discussion of whether gisb should remove the current prohibition on partial day recall rights for the reasons set forth in both ingaas response and the attached comments of the pipeline segment the enron interstate pipelines ask the commission to deny the aga petition december eight two zero zero zero to gas industry standards board from pipeline segment re business practices subcommittee priority action items one and two and rzero zero zero two six at the scheduled december one four two zero zero zero gisb executive committee meeting the agenda includes a discussion and vote on recommendations and proposed standards this agenda item contains certain bps proposals related to implementation of order no six three seven requirements and related standards such as rzero zero zero two six among the proposals are new or revised standards for capacity releases and recalls which include support for intraday capacity releases and would remove current gisb restrictions against partialday recalls our fundamental concern with the proposed standards is that they do not fully address the farreaching impact of flowing day recalls there are significant operational concerns with these standards we are concerned about whether the operational provisions are in place to ensure that the recalled party does not continue to flow particularly during critical periods we are concerned about whether current gisb communication time frames are adequate for handling the ripple effect of flowing day recalls across the grid the proposed standards address only one narrow operational concern whether gas has been scheduled on the particular contract to be recalled this does not begin to address the operational challenges of the recall or the potential impact to other transactions across the grid given these operational concerns we do not understand the rush to adopt flowing day recall standards while we understand that this work is in response to rzero zero zero two six we do not believe that flowing day recalls are necessary to fulfill the scheduling equality requirements of order no six three seven order no six three seven requires that replacement shippers have the same nomination opportunities as shippers acquiring original capacity there are no existing pipeline contracting or scheduling functions that are the equivalent of the recall of capacity by a releasing shipper very few pipelines have received authorization to sell hourly services and most pipeline tariffs prescribe a uniform hourly flow rate throughout the day further most pipelines have not yet received approval to implement balancing provisions to address daily price fluctuations or intraday variability in the spirit of compromise we have worked on and concurred with revised standards that permit intraday releases however under these revised standards all capacity release options continue to be available only on business days to insure that the proper contractual relationships and notice provisions are supported nonetheless throughout the negotiations on this compromise approach the pipelines have made it clear we cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards aside from our opposition to the flowing day recall standards the pipelines have agreed to other recall standards that are more liberal than are supported by the existing standards in this area we have agreed to support a revised standard which will permit capacity to be recalled for transactions in the evening nomination cycle this allows a releasing shipper to recall capacity until the afternoon of the day prior to gas flow while this timeline supports a shorter notice for recalls it still preserves the application of the fullday contract entitlement and gas flow rights for both the releasing and the replacement shippers flowing day recalls though are a separate issue flowing day recalls could significantly increase the incidence of scheduling problems overruns imbalances and increased occurrences of operational flow orders because of the potentially disruptive nature of flowing day recalls pipelines cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards any move from daily increments of service to partialday increments of service must be undertaken in the context of all services offered on each pipeline system including firm services interruptible services and balancing and

two zero zero one the new york times page one column five c two zero zero one new york times company pacific gas and electric the giant california utility may have just made one of the largest bankruptcy filings in history but it has been a banner year for the rest of its parent company the pg e corporation in bethesda md far from the energy crisis in california another pg e subsidiary national energy group earned one six two million last year and ranked as the nations thirdlargest power trader compensation for the units executives soared many investors now believe that the subsidiary just a decade in the making is by itself worth more than its nine six yearold utility sibling how did national energy get so big so fast by using cash partly generated by its sister utility to buy unregulated power plants in the northeast expand tradingfloor operations and sell power across the country the exact numbers are in dispute but much of nationals energys profits last year came from california most other large utilities have done the same thing over the past decade building national or even global power companies from roots in local monopolies but nowhere is the success of these unregulated businesses more of an issue than in california where pg es investments may be challenged in bankruptcy court still such transfers of assets were fundamental to deregulation plans in two dozen states and they were encouraged by federal rules designed to build a new wholesale marketplace in electricity and today the offspring of the nations utilities dominate that market after industry leader enron eight of the nations one zero largest power marketers are affiliates or spinoffs of regulated utilities controlling about four two percent of power trading it is largely these unregulated power producers and traders whose sales of power in california have prompted accusations by state leaders of price gouging and demands for the price caps that federal regulators took their first halting steps toward embracing last week the profitability of the utilities unregulated operations is becoming clear as companies report earnings for the first three months of the year for example reliant energy reported that operating income at its unregulated wholesale energy business soared to two one six million in the first quarter or one six percent more than at its regulated utility which serves houston this week reliant expects to spin off its unregulated businesses through an initial public stock offering that would put a market value on the new company of as much as eight eight billion more than the rest of reliant a number of other major utility companies have spinoffs or trading and generation units that now earn nearly as much as or more than their core utility operations these include duke energy in charlotte nc sempra energy of san diego the southern company in atlanta the constellation energy group in baltimore and utilicorp united in kansas city mo in some places the growth of the unregulated businesses continues to raise questions of fairness particularly where utilities have been permitted to transfer plants to the new units at deep discounts to their market value critics say that ratepayers whose bills paid for the plants construction should benefit more when the plants are sold in florida a commission on energy deregulation formed by gov jeb bush has proposed permitting such transfers on the grounds that they are needed to create a new wholesale marketplace opponents including the florida municipal electric association which represents utilities owned by local governments say the plan would produce a nine billion windfall that should go to ratepayers in california some creditors of pacific gas and electric have signaled that they will want the bankruptcy court in san francisco to review parent pg es efforts to keep its unregulated businesses out of creditors reach and the california public utilities commission is investigating whether pg e and edison international whose southern california edison utility unit is also near insolvency have improperly transferred cash to their parents and to unregulated sister companies a recent audit ordered by the commission showed that pacific gas and electric transferred four one billion to pg e from one nine nine seven to one nine nine nine most of that went to dividends and stock repurchases but eight three eight million was invested in other subsidiaries primarily its national energy group unit southern california edison transferred four eight billion to its parent company between one nine nine six and november two zero zero zero a separate audit showed edison international invested two five billion in its unregulated mission group subsidiaries during the same period executives of the companies say the transfers were proper audits have shown that we followed the rules and didnt do anything wrong said pg es chief executive robert glynn we did not ask consumers in california to support any of the losses that occurred in those businesses when we started them up he said now forcing the unregulated units to support their ailing sister utility he said would be no different than calling up shareholders and saying the california electric bills are pretty high send some money in so we can give it back to them loretta lynch the president of the utilities commission took a different view should we look backward she asked and say hey wait a minute that corporate structure profited by all of our power payments to them in the past and they should participate in helping us through to get to a solution in the future the cornerstone deal of pg es unregulated energy business was struck four years ago when it acquired the hydroelectric and fossilfueled generation plants of new england electric system for one six billion pg e is now one of the largest generators in the northeast operating plants that can light up to five million averagesized homes while california officials say pacific gas and electrics woes have been caused at least in part by market manipulation by outofstate generators the justice department has been investigating possible market abuses involving pg e and two other companies in new england mr glynn said that pg e had done nothing wrong and that the company has responded to justice department requests for information overall pg es national energy group has three zero power plants in one zero states and others under development or construction that include one in athens ny that is expected to begin supplying electricity to new york city in two zero zero three it also operates an energy trading operation in bethesda and controls a natural gas pipeline into northern california to wall street the utility companies investments in unregulated businesses were a necessary survival tactic as investors demanded fastergrowing profits the stock market was going like gangbusters and the utilities returns of one one percent werent cutting it said richard cortright a utility analyst at standard and poors the bond rating agency moreover as deregulation loomed industry executives saw no choice but to make new investments it looked like the utility opportunity was going to start shrinking mr glynn said consumer groups question whether utilities would have invested more in improving basic service if they had not had the option of putting money elsewhere mike florio a lawyer with the utility reform network a consumer group in san francisco cited findings last year by state regulators that from one nine eight seven to one nine nine five pacific gas electric spent nearly five five zero million less on maintaining electric and gas facilities than had been factored into its rates separately in one nine nine nine the utility agreed to pay about two nine million to settle charges that consumers were endangered because it failed to trim trees near highvoltage power lines several hundred million dollars didnt get spent for maintenance and that ultimately falls to the bottom line as profit mr florio said mr glynn said the utility had always spent appropriate sums on maintenance coming within onehalf of one percent of the amount built into rates over a two zero year period in the big picture he said it was hard to see how pg e had been a winner in deregulation even before its utilitys humiliating bankruptcy if you look at what happened the net of it was a loss mr glynn said because the value leaked out on the regulated utility side faster than we were able to build it on the nonregulated side about this report this article is part of a joint reporting effort with the pbs series frontline which will broadcast a documentary about californias energy crisis

company shipping corporation of india sci has been attracting growing interest from analysts of late the main reasons include higher freight rates and the strong possibility of the government offloading its stake in sci this financial year the government holds eight zero per cent of sci stock and is aiming to divest upto four zero per cent indeed the plans for disinvesment are being viewed as a powerful trigger that can send its stock price soaring swinging fortunes the shipping industry holds all the promise and perils of a cyclical industry when it comes to growth prospects for shipping companies much hinges on the level of activity in world trade and shipping tonnage nearly nine four per cent of indias external trade moves by sea major products transported include crude oil petroleum products iron ore steel and grains mighty force with its army of nine nine ships in its fleet boasting four four eight million tonnes in dead weight tonnage dwt staterun sci represents a powerful force in the indian shipping industry it accounts for nearly four zero per cent of the countrys total operating tonnage sailing behind are private competitors like ge shipping essar and varun shipping ships can be broadly classified into tankers and bulk carriers tankers include crude carriers carrying crude oil product carriers for transporting other liquid cargo like petroleum products and chemicals carriers bulk cargo carriers move dry cargo like ores and grains as on april two zero zero zero crude carriers made up nearly four four per cent of scis gross registered tonnagegrt while product carriers accounted for around one one per cent bulk carriers took up nearly two zero per cent better times ahead after weathering stormy waters in the past few years the shipping industry seems ready to chart higher growth in calmer climate propelled by higher freight rates over the past year freight rates have climbed on an average five zero six zero per cent in the tankers market to around two four zero zero zero similarly in the dry bulk segment the baltic freight index the most widelywatched global indicator of spot dry bulk rates is still floating at one five zero zero levels after having peaked at one eight zero zero levels in september two zero zero zero while it has slipped from the one six zero zero levels a year ago analysts expect the index to remain perched around these levels for many these are signs of better fortunes for shipping companies like sci we expect freight rates to stay firm in two zero zero one zero two probably just marginally lower from current levels says pksrivastava chairman and managing director sci restructuring helps sci has also made some restructuring efforts it includes attempts to prune business segments seen to be a drag on company profits like the liners division over the past year the company has found buyers for one zero vessels half of them liners this definitely helps them improve profits and cash flows says deepak agrawal analyst at kotakstreetcom the selling of old ships however is a recurring theme in shipping operations these sales not only improve cash flows but also lift some burden off operating costs in scis case it accounts for nearly seven five per cent of the sales this cash can also be employed in the tanker business agarwal adds in another step sci is also thrashing out the details of a voluntary retirement scheme for employees it has more than one zero zero zero zero employees on its roster in addition heeding consulting house pricewaterhouse cooperspwc recommendations it is also turning to information technology to improve operational efficiency however pwcs suggestion that sci be split into three separate companies has been rejected by the government the restructuring moves are having a positive impact on the company says agarwal winds of change experts say that certain emerging global trends will also influence future operations of sci for one international maritime laws can lead to a supply dip in large carriers like tankers the international maritime organisation imo regulations could see the supply of tankers coming under slight pressure agrees agrawal the imo has asked the global shipping industry to gradually phase out single hull tankers and embrace newer double hull tankers seen as more environmentconscious as scrapping of old design tankers gathers pace the nature of shipbuilding will ensure that they wont be replaced immediately industry sources say that it takes roughly three years to build and operate large carriers like tankers the impending imbalance in tanker demand and supply also seems reason enough for some to believe that freight rates for the segment will remain pegged at higher levels besides production pattern changes in indias oil industry a major client for the shipping sector are also engineering changes in some segments improved oil refining capacity in the country is already signalling declining demand for product tankers carrying petroleum products on the other hand demand for crude tankers is slated to rise as demand for crude surges to feed increased refining capacity india imports nearly seven zero per cent of its total requirements of crude oil in one nine nine nine two zero zero zero sci was the countrys largest carrier of crude bringing in six one per cent of the total requirements of the staterun and joint venture oil companies there is also growing evidence that more consumers are shifting smaller breakbulk cargoes into containers industry watchers say that this rate of containerisation of cargo is set to quicken container shipping forms slightly more than half the worlds cargo shipping yet currently forms just under three per cent of scis grt it is a very important segment for us next only to the lng segment says srivastava howeverhe adds we are looking more at alliances in this segment and not additional capital expenditure here the brightest spot one opportunity that experts forecast will be a revenuegrosser for the indian shipping industry in the coming years is the budding demand for natural gas with demand expected to far outstrip local supplies the government is already considering legislation for the transportation and import of liquefied natural gaslng sci with its mitsui osk linesled consortium has already edged ahead of rivals in this arena by clinching a four

lrtwo tanker in cochin in fiscal two zero zero two we are looking at acquiring one zero one two ships says srivastava while the company has a stash of rs one three nine zero crore in reserves it often

regards to the dpc project are concerned there was unanimity among all the members the committees report notes the exact terms need to be agreed between the contracting parties but in the committees opinion unless the negotiations proceed on these broad guidelines and various parties make concessions of this magnitude the ultimate result is likely to be as infructuous as the earlier renegotiations in one nine nine five the concessions recommended by the committee include the seperation of the lng facility it is critical that the cost of this facility be distributed over its entire capacity and not just over the amount sold to the power plant the lng facility be seperated into a distinct facility whose capital costs are reflected in the fuel charge not as take or pay but only in proportion to the extent of fuel regasified for power generation compared to the total regasification capacity also recommended are renegotiation of the lng supply and shipping agreements

only does the wind industry supply about one three of denmarks power but danish companies currently control about five zero of the four five billion global windmill market and their share is increasing whats more the market itself has been growing by three zero to four zero a year since the late one nine nine zero s creating a tidy windfall for the manufacturers vestas for example has seen its stock rise twentyfold in three years revenues grew by three seven last year to seven three eight million and profits hit one zero three million wind is the great energy success story of the last decade says roderick bridge an analyst at hsbc investment bank in london flawed policy the us could have played a bigger role american companies began to build the first generation of truly modern windmills in the early one nine eight zero s armed with carterera tax credits aimed at promoting green energy the credits got the industry off the ground but the policy was flawed both the federal government and california offered tax credits only for the installation of windmills not for operating and maintaining them so when the windmills broke down they were often simply left to rust after energy prices fell and funding for wind programs under ronald reagan contracted the us gave up its lead in wind technology it was uncle sam that birthed the industry then lost it to the rest of the world laments james dehlsen founder of us turbine maker zond corp which was sold later to houstonbased enron corp denmarks public policy has been more consistent and was better conceived from the start the government chose to pay windmill owners abovemarket prices for their power subsidizing upkeep and investment in new technology the original california system encouraged doctors and dentists to buy wind turbines says vestas poulsen but our wind producers have much more of an incentive to care whether they work another difference from the beginning danish windmill makers knew they needed to export our small home market gives us no choice says per hornung pedersen chief financial officer at the secondlargest danish producer neg micon this early export focus gave the danes a leg up on big competitors in germany and spain wise technology choices helped the danes build on the generous government support while us manufacturers working with aerospace technology concentrated on lightweight materials that were efficient but fragile danish companies started off as heavyduty farm machinery makers the original danish turbines were more than twice the weight of comparable american turbines and proved much more durable recalls birger t madsen managing director of denmarkbased btm consult a leading wind power consultancy gradually the danes improved the efficiency of their devices where early models were outfitted with two two five kilowatt generators todays models can churn out as much as of two megawatts enough to power two zero zero zero homes larger two five and three megawatt machines are under developmentsome of them destined for offshore environments where the wind is reliable but storms waves and salty conditions demand unprecedented ruggedness and improvements in computerized control systems are helping turbines squeeze out more watts from the wind more efficiently the best windmills now can produce a kilowatthour of electricity for about four centshalf the cost of five years ago and approaching the price of power generated by gasfired plants still the wind business must overcome some giant hurdles starting with political risks in the us a tax credit for wind power comes up for congressional renewal this december at a time when president george w bush is pushing for a three zero cut in federal funding for renewable power and conservation programs and even though wind power is increasingly cost competitive many wouldbe windmill operators in both the us and europe still need subsidies to win longterm financing so if the tax credit isnt renewed the danes largest market could blow away little secret critics contend that the subsidies themselves are a problem they argue that wind power will never prove its merit until the artificial tax credits and price supports on both sides of the atlantic are removed the danish government pays more than three zero zero million to wind generators every year partly as a result of those high subsidies the danes pay the highest rates for electricity in the world argues brian oconnell author of a book critical of renewable energy policies skeptics have other objections as well birds sometimes get chopped in the turbines and people who live near wind farms often say they are an eyesore but the biggest problems are intrinsic windmills only produce when the wind is up and for now there is no way to store the surplus electricity until that issue is resolved btm consult figures wind systems could supply a maximum of about a third of global electricity demand thats much more than now but with solar and other renewables lagging far behind the difference would still have to be made up by fossil fuels at least some of winds liabilities may eventually be solved powerstorage technologies are in development in laboratories around the world and while the us has officially repudiated the one nine nine seven kyoto protocol which called for dramatic cuts in carbon emissions other governments are likely to encourage more wind power as part of the effort to reduce greenhouse gases the european union for one has set targets for a fivefold growth of renewable energy by two zero one zero worldwide the danes face growing competition from abb the giant swedishswiss power company recently announced a novel type of gearless windmill that converts turbine rotation to energy by means of a magnetrun transformerless highvoltage generator since the gearbox is often a source of trouble abbs gearless device could make a big splash in the market nevertheless many analysts believe the danes have a comfortable edge neg micon recently raised one zero zero million in fresh financing and is expected to report a profit for two zero zero zero its stock has more than tripled over the past year yielding a market cap up to one five billion vestas market cap is five five billion and privately held companies report soaring sales already the windmill business has revived rural jutlands economy which previously struggled along on shipbuilding fishing and farming when the shipyard in the town of ringkobing went broke in one nine nine nine vestas converted the facilities to make windmills now its expanding the site and has doubled its workforce to three zero zero zero in the past five years all the shipyard workers got jobs here says vestas welder thomas knudsen wind power may look like an anachronism but its gaining ground more quickly than other renewable sources it may well turn out to be the green power of choice for the two one st century photograph wind

seven two euone one copyright two zero zero one mcgrawhill inc when president bush discarded the kyoto protocolan international agreement to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other globalwarming gaseshe blamed the decision on a slowing us economy and an energy crisis the idea of placing caps on cotwo does not make economic sense for america bush said on mar two nine some of the worlds largest companies disagree dupont for example has already made substantial cuts in its greenhousegas emissions and says it will continue to do so despite the administrations reluctance the announcements around kyoto dont change our resolve says paul tebo corporate vicepresident for safety health and environment at dupont why because the companys environmental program pays off in enhanced shareholder value says tebo you cant measure this to the penny but it is very real corporate reputation is a very valuable part of our company good sense dupont is not alone on apr four the business roundtable proposed various solutions to the globalwarming problem in a report titled unleashing innovation the right approach to global climate change earnest w deavenport chairman and chief executive of eastman chemical co who chaired the business roundtables environment task force said the report represents the business communitys interest in being part of the solution to concerns about global climate change increasingly corporations are deciding to join efforts to curb global warming because the strategy makes good business sense others include bp amoco royal dutchshell ford and general motorsall companies that would be expected to fight limits on greenhousegas emissions until recently these four companies were members of the global climate coalition a group formed to oppose mandatory limits on greenhouse emissions all have pulled out bp and shell arent stopping with that gesture they have joined two dozen other companiesincluding alcoa enron georgiapacific and toyotain a new group called the pew center on global climate change the center brings companies together to search for solutions to the globalwarming problem i think they are convinced that at one time or another there will be regulation of greenhouse gases because this is a real problem says pew center president eileen claussen its difficult to know whether the companies will keep their resolve when the time comes to act on their pledges to cut emissions some of them however have already begun to act bp and shell for example have each established internal emissionstrading schemes the idea is to reduce emissions more than necessary where it is economical to do so creating emissions permits to be sold to other units within the company if emissions trading among companies becomes a reality bp and shell unlike their competitors will already know how to use it to their advantage the big three auto makers have likewise jumped ahead of regulators with a game of oneupsmanship to boost vehicle mileage ford motor co took the lead in two zero zero zero when it publicly promised to improve the fuel economy of all its suvs by two five over five years general motors corp promised to beat fords improvements and daimlerchrysler has just joined the game saying it will meet or beat any ford suv fueleconomy gains these moves represent a significant change in corporate behavior so far it has been mostly promises but if those promises arent kept environmental groups which are watching very closely will do their best to stage a public flogging the bush administration with its narrow view of the worlds energy problems sees boosts in oil exploration and production as nonnegotiable goals cheap energy is good for the economy and boosting supply is one way to help bring down prices but the administration has given no hint that it perceives global warming as a serious problem and such a stance carries a risk while some uncertainty remains about the consequences of global warming the overwhelming evidence suggests that the phenomenon is real the probusiness bush administration should listen a little more closely to what some businesses are actually saying news of the week energy

zero two zero zero one the wall street journal europe three two copyright c two zero zero one dow jones company inc six european institutions rank among the worlds five zero best business schools in a new wall street journal survey of corporate recruiters in a result thats sure to surprise many business schools and students alike esade of spain insead of france and imd of switzerland beat such elite american institutions as columbia university the university of california at los angeles and the massachusetts institute of technology the other european schools in the top five zero are london business school of the uk and instituto de empresa and iese of spain the tuck school at dartmouth college the worlds first graduate school of business ranks no one in the journals first survey of mba recruiters darmouth beat out such institutions as harvard university stanford university and the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania recruiters who rated the schools in an online survey praised dartmouths small collegial mba program for producing general managers who make loyal team players for more on dartmouth see the story on page three three close behind dartmouth in second and third place were two other small mba programs with fewer than five zero zero fulltime students carnegie mellon universitys graduate school of industrial administration and yale universitys school of management both received high marks for their students teamwork strengths and analytical and problemsolving skills the rankings are based on a survey conducted last fall by harris interactive inc in which one six zero zero recruiters rated schools they knew from firsthand experience the survey reached people in the field doing the actual recruiting the heads of business units line managers and others not just the humanresources executives stationed at corporate headquarters each school was ranked on two seven factors that influence a recruiters decision to visit a particular campus and hire a particular graduate such as the careerservices office the core curriculum and students leadership potential and teamwork skills in addition a schools final ranking took into account its mass appeal based on the number of recruiters who rated it theres no question that all of the schools in the study offer quality mba programs but the wall street journalharris interactive study of mba programs is the only major survey that focuses exclusively on the opinions of recruiters the buyers of mba talent consider it a consumers ranking of mba programs with results that differ considerably from those in other businessschool guides the mba programs outside the us made a strong showing in the survey representing nearly two zero of the ranked business schools thats especially impressive because eight three of the recruiters rated only us schools one zero selected nonus schools only and seven selected both american and nonus schools the mba degree an american creation is being offered by more universities and their graduates appeal to multinational companies seeking managers with a strong international perspective canada claims the highestranked nonus school the university of western ontario in two two nd place while the six european schools are joined by one in mexico and a second one in canada theres a very good showing of nonus schools in the survey says joy sever a senior vice president at harris interactive for some of the schools it may have been the first time they had been approached to participate in a ranking moreover she says peoples assumptions about whats best needs to be thought about in a different way given that several european schools outranked some american heavyweights indeed the one of the biggest surprises of the survey is the mixed reviews garnered by the big prestigious business schools some of the titans including northwestern the university of chicago and harvard ranked in the top one zero but wharton placed only one eight th and columbia university mit and stanford finished much further down in the rankings recruiters complained that graduates of some of the most prominent schools expect too much too soon in terms of salary and position and are difficult to retain for very long not a single school in the western us made it into the top two zero the toprated school in the west the haas school of business at the university of california berkeley placed two one st in fact recruiters say they have stopped visiting some of the california schools especially stanford because their graduates are simply unwilling to leave the sunshine and silicon valley behind business schools in california also lagged behind the other schools on students leadership potential their general management point of view and recruiter satisfaction with the careerservices office what school is best depends on the recruiters needs says recruiter laura barker morse at venturecapital firm atlas venture the bostonbased recruiting principal has recruited for earlystage technology companies in the us and europe for more than two zero years choosing students from harvard stanford mit berkeley wharton columbia and insead because they met certain needs we want to be helpful to our fast growing companies so for a strong technology and business orientation in europe we tend to go to insead which uses the casestudy method patterned after harvard ms barker morse says but for european companies we also go out of our way to get to know the europeans who attend us schools what set the top one zero schools apart from the rest for one thing they significantly outscored the others on five specific attributes teaching analytical and problemsolving skills recruiters past success with the quality of graduates hired from that school the schools preparation of students for the new economy graduates strategic thinking and chemistry or general good feelings about the school many of the topranked schools also received high scores for their graduates communication and interpersonal skills which nine out of one zero recruiters said they consider very important jeff puzas a manager at the consulting firm prtm in washington dc has recruited at both harvard and carnegie mellon and believes carnegie mellon has the edge in analytical and technical skills while graduates of harvard excel in interpersonal communication interpersonal skills are like a sixth sense and have been highly underrated as a differentiating factor for students says mr puzas a carnegie mellon graduate most of what i do every day as a management consultant has to do with interpersonal skills not my iq the need for companies to effectively communicate with clients means elena florez spanish recruiting coordinator for american management systems inc in madrid recruits mainly from iese the international graduate school of management in barcelona and instituto de empresa in madrid in spain not many people speak english so we need people who can understand the language and culture she says being small clearly was a virtue for many of the business schools in the survey half of the top one zero schools and one four of the top two five report fulltime mba enrollments of fewer than five zero zero students in general recruiters say they find graduates of small mba programs more collaborative and personable than their counterparts at large schools paolo raffaelli key account manager at guidant corp a us developer of cardiovascular products says smaller schools like switzerlands imd with a class size of around eight zero students offer a more intimate studying environment this allows faculty to observe each student more closely he says as one survey respondent remarks about switzerlands imd theres a real focus on getting students a great job that is a really good fit another respondent julie hamrick president of ignite sales a fouryearold internet marketing firm in dallas has visited business schools of all sizes but we find time and time again betterprepared students at the small schools theyre less theoretical more handson she says they also seem more teamoriented and its critically important that you can rely on every member of the team in a startup like mine adds a recruiter who has hired students from imd small is clearly stronger ms hamrick scouts for mba talent at her alma mater southern methodist university which ranked ninth in the survey and has a fulltime mba enrollment of two three six she also has recruited at dartmouth with three seven five fulltime students and found that in many ways it epitomizes the smallschool environment the studentfaculty ratio is seven to one team projects figure heavily in the curriculum and many students live in campus dorms and belong to school hockey teams and ski groups in remote snowy hanover new hampshire you have to get along at a small business school like tuck theres no place to hide says bill sones a consultant for a software company in boston who received his mba degree from yale in one nine nine eight the student and alumni networks are very closeknit at dartmouth and yale students arent out for no one as much you dont have to watch your back but a small class size can sometimes work against a school lucy barry head of recruitment for londonbased strategy consultants lek consulting recruits more people from fontainebleaubased insead than imd in lausanne its a numbers game says ms barry we are more likely to find a candidate at a school with a larger class size particularly if there are a large number of recruiters insead has nearly seven zero zero mba students in fontainebleau and singapore the businessschool survey included an academics section in which recruiters nominated schools they considered exceptional in certain fields of study three schools placed first in two different academic disciplines wharton for accounting and finance stanford for ecommerce and entrepreneurship and harvard for general management and strategy but academic reputation had surprisingly little bearing on recruiters overall rankings of the schools faculty and curriculum were among the leastsignificant factors in the survey that helps explain why some of the academic starts didnt dazzle recruiters and didnt necessarily receive a top ranking in the finer academic institutions virtually one zero zero of the faculty are phds says jack bragin of the recruiting firm michael page international inc but students can benefit from professors who are more streetwise and have more realworld experience many recruiters said they find it especially difficult to compete for graduates from some of the academic elite that may change amid the economic slowdown as the job market eases but at the time of the survey respondents complained that they often came away from the elite schools emptyhanded because of graduates unrealistic salary and career expectations they also criticized the graduates for having arrogant attitudes and said they find few team players at some of the prestigious schools recruiters are clearly ambivalent about schools like harvard which they overwhelmingly name as the mba program with the most competitive environment they see it as the gold standard of business schools but the largest number think of arrogance when asked what first comes to mind when they hear the harvard name even so when recruiters were asked which school they would choose to get an mba degree harvard ranked third in number of mentions harvard graduates i have interviewed are discernibly different from other ivy league graduates more wellrounded entrepreneurial and worldy says mr bragin but you have to deal with their excessive expectations about what their mba degree will get them some seem to expect to be ceo within two years kristin gandy associate recruiter for enron corp was disappointed with her visit to mit last year she recalls that about half the students on her interview schedule failed to show up and didnt bother to call or write a letter of apology we didnt have a good fall season at mit and werent at all pleased with the results ms gandy says but she adds the school seems to be changing for the better this year under its new careerdevelopment director indeed jackie wilbur the new director says mit students will now lose recruiting services if they miss interviews mits sloan school of management ranked three eight th in the survey and received its lowest scores for its careerservices office value for the money spent on the recruiting effort and companies success in retaining its graduates richard schmalensee the sloan schools dean is sympathetic to recruiters frustrations but he doesnt apologize for his students selectivity you can make the argument that our students are expensive and hard to keep mr schmalensee says but if they werent id have a problem with that people who like to take risks and are looking for challenging work are drawn to mit tim butler director of mba career development programs at harvard believes recruiters too quickly blame the schools for their low recruiting yield or their inability to retain the graduates they do hire the real issue often is the attractiveness of the company and its ability to develop their careers and keep them interested he says companies think only of pay as a way to keep employees they need to think more creatively of how to excite these top performers the rating criteria recruiters rated business schools and their students on these two seven attributes school attributes the careerservices office at that school the past success recruiters have had in terms of the number of graduates they have hired from that school the past success theyve had with the quality of graduates they have hired from that school the core curriculum a particular specialty that is offered at that school the faculty the students average number of years of work experience the willingness of the schools students to relocate to the job location recruiters require the longterm success recruiters have had with students hired from the school the success they have had retaining students hired from the

reporter associate paola hjelt zero four three zero two zero zero one fortune magazine time inc one four two copyright two zero zero one visit the folks at boeing these days and if theyre not too busy fending off chagrined seattleites theyll talk your ear off theres just a good chance that the conversation wont be about planes dont misinterpret this the past year has been kind to the one five thlargest company in the world revenues fell but earnings and operating margins were surprisingly strong and while every stock big and small seemed to crater boeings shares are up some four zero since april of last year but just building planes isnt doing it anymore at boeing demand for jets is slowing as airlines consolidate and competition from airbus is pressuring margins so whats got boeing execs really fired up lately you guessed it the internet whos going to buy a jet online you may ask who knows who cares respond boeing execs thats not why theyre consumed with the internet boeing doesnt want to be the amazoncom of the aerospace industry what boeing wants to do is rethink its business it needs to build planes faster and for less money more significant it needs to get into less cyclical highermargin businesses like aircraft maintenance the math here is pretty simple boeing earns nine margins building planes it can make more than two zero margins servicing them theoretically at least the internet will make doing all this easier in other cases it will make it possible whats happening at boeing is hardly new a handful of corporate executives like john chambers larry ellison kenneth lay michael dell and jack welch have understood the power of the internet for years its why virtually no paper changes hands at cisco its why oracle could even claim to have saved one billion a year its why enron has been able to transform itself from a lowmargin natural gas supplier to a highmargin energytrading firm its why dell has no stores and no inventory and its why ge can boast it will more than double pretax earnings in the next few years the difference today is that the stakes are much higher embracing the net when the economy was booming and few competitors understood the technology was one thing then failure could be repositioned as a learning experience now with recessionnot stock optionsthe dominant topic at cocktail parties there is little room to screw up investors are demanding fiscal discipline and so technology budgets are tightening expected to grow just four to six this year down from one two last year at the same time the pressure on corporations to develop a net game before their competitors do is only growing its a scary combination at a recent conference merrill lynch ceo david komansky said he couldnt remember a time at least in his business when there was such an enormous premium on being right the pressure isnt keeping them from trying even with tech spending slowing when it comes to using the web to make operations more efficient few ceos are scaling back according to chuck phillips a morgan stanley analyst who regularly surveys chief information officers ralph szygenda gms cio brags that hes cut gms tech spending by two zero in five years to three two billion and still made a one six billion investment in ebusiness for companies just now gearing up theyre lucky the net has been with us long enough that a handful of lessons are emerging looking at boeings internet strategy is particularly instructive it may be the most ambitious of any major corporation yet true ge and the automakers too are using the internet to run their core businesses better but talk to boeing execs and youll find that everything at the company is being reexamined from how it interacts with its customers and one five zero zero zero suppliers right down to whether plane making should be its core business the goal is to change the entire fabric of the company part of the reason for the overhaul is that for such a hightech operation boeing until recently was a pretty backward place sure the company liked to think it knew more about building planes than anyone in the world but good luck trying to get your hands on that information after the planes were built much of its extensive knowledge about aerospace design and manufacturing was locked in giant paper binders or in one of one eight incompatible procurement computer systems the only people who could find it were people who knew where to look even until the middle of last year suppliers could be making the same part for a handful of boeing divisions and because of the distinct procurement computers get one eight different contracts a big chunk of the work is finished but theres still more to do many small parts like brackets which connect overhead bins to the fuselage are still designed and manufactured from scratch every time right now if you wanted to look inside boeing to see if another division had manufactured a part with the specs you needed you cant do that says cio scott griffin digitizing the data is already helping to solve the problems even better its helping trim costs boeing generates a billion pages of paper a year building planes in two years griffin wants to have cut that by three zero to five zero there are costs in printing paper in managing it in shipping it he says none of this has anything to do with building a plane its evil he says like inventory the hope to run boeing as efficiently as cisco where memos invoices engineering drawingsvirtually everythinghappen over the net instead of on paper eventually as boeing goes down this road webifying the company will help ease entry into new lines of business and increase sales to compete in the maintenance market boeing is arming its crews with wireless devices that connect to the companys databases if a crew member wants to consult the manual while on the tarmac he can do so without having to drive back to the hangar this summer boeing is going to begin purchasing airplane production parts online from its suppliers standardizing and reducing the number of parts has helped boost margins on planebuilding to nine from five in one nine nine nine last month for the first time boeing conducted an online reverse auction for natural gas which it uses to heat many of its plants it got the gas one zero cheaper and sealed the deal in a few hours instead of several weeks and the company is increasingly giving its customers the easy access to boeing information they crave on myboeingfleetcom customers can now research design and maintenance issues for almost all of the airlines commercial fleet and order many of the parts they need the upshot online sales of boeing spare parts are up more than one zero and where boeing once retained some six zero employees just to handle faxes and phone calls from its customers it now does the same work with one two people the ultimate payoff for boeing could be huge but its strategy is fraught with risks think about it in maintenance one of boeings big competitorsgeis also one of its biggest customers more broadly boeing is spending millions of dollars to get its one nine eight zero zero zero employees to change the way they work and people dont like to change the way they do anything for griffin or any of boeings senior executives implementing all this isnt particularly glamorous work not like say buying or turning around companies webifying is an expensive disruptive unsexy management challenge when boeing started on its reengineering four years ago costs skyrocketed and at first productivity dropped its like fixing subway tracks a necessary evil that when completed goes largely unnoticed look at whats happened to nike last year the company decided to automate its entire supply chain so that when retailers ordered shoes they could do it on the nike site the hope was that the system would automatically take payments deliver the shoes and when supplies dropped notify the manufacturers in asia the reality was that nike wound up with too much inventory in some models and not enough in others earnings for the quarter ended feb two eight fell three three as a result analysts believe the problem will take the rest of the year at leastto correct this is what we get for our four zero zero million wondered nike chairman phil knight what makes boeings strategy even riskier is that theres no guarantee that success will lead to a lasting competitive advantage charles schwab is learning that right now it revolutionized the brokerage industry in early one nine nine eight when it started allowing clients to research buy and sell stocks online by midone nine nine nine that experiment had proven so successful that big brokerage firms were quaking for a few weeks schwabs market cap exceeded merrill lynchs even though schwab had onefifth its sales that isnt so anymore merrill and the other big firms launched their own electronic trading products soon after and today merrills offerings are as sophisticated as schwabs schwabs market capitalization is now less than half merrills so whats a big ol corporation to do here are four lessons one grab the lowhanging fruit first the conventional wisdom among consultants and other reengineering cognoscenti is that in order to truly leverage a business on the internet one has to follow boeings lead and rethink the business model from the top down otherwise says ray lane a partner at kleiner perkins and the former no two at oracle the process stalls as four zero yearold department heads who think they know everything get caught in turf battles he may be right but most companies dont have the stomach for that kind of risk indeed the nearbilliondollar cargo operations of united and american airlines are taking a different tack theyve started small teaming up with a new dallas company called nextjet to offer businesses and consumers doortodoor sameday package delivery on domestic flights a huge percentage of passenger planes cargo space goes unused airlines have long sold this excess space but it was up to the sender to get the package to the airport find the right flight and arrange to have the package picked up at the destination nextjet created software that trolled reservation systems figured out the quickest way to route packages and worked with couriers for delivery american and united simply rebranded nextjets system and stuck it on their websites the result united started offering the service in early march and says that in the first three weeks it scored three zero zero steady customers with zero marketing we had everyone from architects and lawyers needing to get documents across the country by days end to parents on vacation sending house keys to their lockedout teenage children says jim hartigan who runs the united cargo operation at two zero zero a pop each package is like having an extra passengerand you dont have to feed the cargo or give it legroom soon united will market the service more aggressively to corporate customers hartigan says he can see doubling the size of uniteds cargo business using the net but starting small helps his team understand the pitfalls of the business without too much risk two dont get fixated on the technology certainly the right hardware and software are important to be successful but they are catalysts not solutions says adrian slywotsky a consultant at mercer management in boston webifying a business is about getting employees to work more efficiently he says and that has everything to do with good management and little to do with technology not that many ceos get it to this day most start with the technology rather than the business issues he says lisa harris the cio at staff leasing a three one billion florida company that acts as the hr department for one zero seven zero zero small to medium sized businesses says her company learned that lesson the hard way it spent millions on an online system two years ago with the idea of using the net to offer customers two four hour selfservice hr support backed up by a call center to answer more complicated questions the only trouble was that operators in the call center were being evaluated based on how many calls they answered as a result they didnt encourage clients to use the website but rather to continue calling with their questions the solution staff leasing began evaluating callcenter operators not just on volume of calls answered but on errors generated in addition the company started handing operators bonuses for every account they moved to the web it was bf skinner meets the web operators could do things the old way make a mistake and get penalized or they could get a bonus for doing things the new way they quickly fell in line then another problem cropped up once customers became comfortable using the web to handle basic hr needs the only questions they had for the operators were questions most couldnt answer difficult dilemmas had previously been handled by specially trained hr consultants solution fire some callcenter operators retrain others and hire more consultants today with four zero of staff leasings customers using the web the company has cut two five million a year in expenses a good lesson says harris but one that took too long to figure out when we started the project it was strictly an infotech operation she says it wasnt until a year later that it became a project sponsored by the entire business three its not about cutting out the middleman two years ago the chief benefit of a web strategy was in allowing manufacturers to bypass distributors and reach out directly to customers but today middlemen seem if anything to be thriving most early attempts to eliminate distributors have failed what happened the internet enabled manufacturers to sell directly to customers but it didnt teach them how to sell it turned out that their distributors lengthy relationships with their customers werent easily broken in most markets middlemen are the basis of trust to do the transaction says michael nevens a consultant at mckinsey co in palo alto calif look at the resale market for semiconductors he says when manufacturers have excess chips they dont want to advertise that because it drives the price down but they still want to sell them meanwhile chip buyers want to be sure the chips they are getting are of good quality who solves that problem a middleman both parties trust in the computer hardware business for example there were a flood of online catalog companies like buycom which were convinced that the internet would quickly kill off the salesman and that the only way to compete was on price computer retailing giant cdw wasnt one of them instead it embraced its middleman status and made big investments in staff not just technology to pull it off in one nine nine eight cdw started bulking up growing from three zero zero salesmen to nearly one two zero zero by the end of last year the result a record year for revenue growth and earnings to make this strategy work cdw made sure that salesmen got a commission even when the sale went through the internet small and mediumsized businesses need efficiency but there also are certain situations where you just need to talk to someone says jim shanks cdws cio sure a large percentage of our business comes unassisted through the web but the majority of the business is one where a customer gets educated and then calls the account manager four dont reject plans with hardtomeasure results department store and advertising pioneer john wanamaker once noted that half his advertising was wasted he just didnt know which half its a cute way of saying that while advertising works its bottomline benefit is hard if not impossible to measure some internet initiatives are going to be like that too the smart companies will pursue them fidelity investments for example last year began offering web based four zero one k administration for small companies its been an instant hit the program added seven five zero companies last year historically its been hard for small companies to have four zero one k benefits because administrators charged too much or in fidelitys case didnt offer them at all because they were too expensive to operate whats in it for fidelity well the program was expensive to set up isnt profitable and doesnt generate big fees but efour zero one k isnt being measured by how much money it makes its about taking a small risk on a technology that might prove to be essentialboth to getting into a new market and to discovering new tools for existing customers i had this same discussion in the early one nine nine zero s when we went after the middle market says steve elterich president of fidelity ebusiness at that point no one was offering four zero one k services to them thats now our most profitable market segment why a lot of those companieslike microsofthave grown into very very big companies digesting all this change wont be easy the internet isnt just some passing management fad but a fundamental shift in the way americans and the world conduct business indeed some consultants like don tapscott still believe its impact will be as profound as the impact of the corporation itself more than a century ago it wont happen fast but it will happen for those whose first inclination is to bury their head in the sand at least until the economy picks up resist now is the time to look around and learn from those who have already made their mistakes reporter associate paola hjelt

investors that his eight five two billion acquisition of mobil corp on november three zero one nine nine nine was a good idea that bigger really is better raymond six two has weapons to make his case the marriage of exxon corp and mobil corp created a behemoth with one four nine billion in assets including oil and gas fields in two zero zero countries and territories on six continents four four refineries that sell about two zero zero million gallons of fuel a day in one one eight countries and four five zero zero zero service stations worldwide this should be his moment with internet and dotcom stocks in decline investors are looking harder at the value big oil companies provide theres an oilpatch veteran in the white house and those pesky environmentalists are in retreat stellar balance sheet raymond can point to a stellar balance sheet as well last year exxon mobil squeezed out of those formidable assets a profit of one seven seven billion which was more than double the year earlier and a record for a publicly traded company revenue increased two five percent to two three two seven billion also a record for the first quarter of this year revenue rose five nine percent to

trades at one six four times earnings chevron at one zero six times and texaco at one two eight twenty one of the two nine analysts who follow exxon mobil rate the company a buy investors question whether exxon mobil can sustain its performance if oil and gas prices fall about seven zero percent or one two four billion of exxon mobils two zero zero zero profits came from the sale of oil and gas prices of which rose six zero percent and four five percent respectively year over year refining business the companys refining business brought in three four billion its chemical business earned one two billion and the remainder came from such operations as mining some critics such as enron corp ceo jeff skilling say the company might be better off if it broke into its component parts investors seem to agree shares of houstonbased eog resources inc the former exploration and production arm of enron more than tripled last year and shares of san antoniobased refiner valero energy corp rose eight seven percent is it the best way to play energy no said charles white of avatar associates which manages a little more than three billion and counts exxon mobil shares as one of its largest holdings for instance if you wanted an exploration company and were willing to do the research and trade often youd be better off with eog apache corp or devon energy but if youre just looking for a big company exxon mobil is the bellwether other critics other critics including michael carpenter citigroup incs head of investment and corporate banking have labeled exxon mobils successful first full year a fluke the only companies in the world that make more money than we do today are a couple of oil companies that got lucky with high oil prices carpenter told analysts in january citigroup the biggest us financial services company earned one three five billion last year with such critical shots aimed at his company raymond often finds himself on the defensive he counters by pointing to the contributions that big projects like the hoover and diana fields will make down the line by two zero zero two the hoover diana operation could produce about one zero zero zero zero zero barrels of oil and three two five million cubic feet of gas a day at current prices that translates into more than one billion of sales a year protected from price fluctuations raymond also proclaims that his company will make money irrespective of prices the detractors or the critics can say weve benefited from high oil and gas prices and theres no question that is true but thats not really the way we analyze the business he said instead of saying given a price heres what were going to do we went to the other side and said lets accept that we cannot forecast the price so what can we do thats a much more challenging task oil and gas prices may actually have to fall for exxon mobil to prove itself when exxon agreed to buy mobil oil prices on the new york mercantile exchange were hovering around one zero a barrel the lowest levels seen since the great depression the merger was supposed to create a company with an inventory of projects large enough and efficient enough to withstand those types of prices three zero per barrel in its first full fiscal year as a company oil prices averaged more than three zero a barrel it hasnt been tested on the low side buying mobil was just one of many steps exxon has taken in the past decade or so to switch from focusing on growth to focusing on controlling costs raymond cites the cost savings that the company has reaped following the merger exxon mobil has raised its mergerrelated savings estimate six four percent to four six billion a year in part by intending to cut one nine zero zero zero jobs by two zero zero two new technology is integral to the costcutting effort raymond who used to be with exxons research group in houston often refers to exxon mobil as the nasa of the sea exxon mobil spends more than five zero zero million a year developing proprietary technology for everything from stronger steel so pipelines can take gas out of remote places like alaska to platform designs for fields deeper than hoover and diana deepwater fields because it can cost two zero million to five zero million to drill a single well at deepwater fields such as hoover and diana william drennan the companys head geosciences researcher focuses on ensuring that few dry holes get dug he spends much of his day standing in front of a seamless three two foot screen in a blackedout room in houston that looks like a miniaturized imax theater the auditorium contains stadiumstyle seats with large tables for note taking on the tables are three d glasses that when worn turn the image on the screen into a hologram drennan can then virtually walk through a map of an oil reservoir and working with his fellow scientists determine where wells should be drilled last year advances in drilling methods and reservoir mapping helped exxon mobil cut to six five cents its cost to find a barrel of oil down from one two zero in one nine nine nine selective investments raymond says cost cutting is important because it forces exxon mobil to be more selective in its investments than its peers are a bad investment decision could be around for more than two zero years he said in august he offered analysts a chart showing that from one nine nine zero to one nine nine nine bp wrote off nine four billion worth of projects shell wrote off two nine billion and exxon mobil wrote off none if you look around youll see all of our competitors have had massive writeoffs raymond said and what amazes me is that when that happens the investment community cheers and i kind of wonder were they cheering when those investments were made raymonds been applying his brand of frugality at exxon since joining the company as a production research engineer in tulsa oklahoma in one nine six three soon after receiving a phd in chemical engineering from the university of minnesota a native of watertown south dakota who attended the university of wisconsin as an undergraduate raymond moved up the ladder with exxon in the us venezuela and aruba exxon nuclear he became president of exxon nuclear co in one nine seven nine and moved to new york in one nine eight one when he was named executive vice president of exxon enterprises a company that had principal responsibility for exxons investments outside the areas of petroleum chemicals and minerals about that time oil companies cash rich from high prices and in the hopes of diversifying profits were making acquisitions in businesses they knew little about exxon sold office equipment mobil owned discount retailer montgomery ward the strategy reached the height of silliness when gulf corp later acquired by chevron considered buying ringling brothers and barnum bailey circus analysts werent much more impressed with exxons forays beyond oil they were especially turned off by exxons one two four billion purchase of reliance electric co a clevelandbased manufacturer of motors and electrical communications and weighing equipment in one nine seven nine energysaving device the company hoped to profit from technological developments contained in an energysaving device for electric motors the technology eventually proved to be commercially unfeasible by one nine eight three raymond had been named president and director of what was then called esso interamerica inc with responsibilities for exxons operations in the caribbean and central and south america so reliances downfall wasnt his problem he was named a senior vice president and director of the corporation in one nine eight four exxon sold reliance for one three five billion in one nine eight six in a leveraged buyout by a management group and what were then citicorp capital investors and prudentialbache securities inc that same year exxon sold exxon nuclear and its share of the companys rockefeller center headquarters in manhattan it would move to its current headquarters in irving texas in one nine nine zero one year later raymond became president of exxon corp he was named chairman and chief executive of exxon corp in april one nine nine three succeeding lawrence rawl who was about to reach the companys mandatory retirement age of six five dark suits white shirts raymond a man who favors dark suits white shirts and red ties has earned a reputation for handson management when he bought mobil for example he and now retired mobil head lucio lou noto hammered out most of the details on their own waiting until due diligence to call in advisers raymond said the ultimate lesson he learned in the three zero years before he took control of exxon is that efficiency is king for large companies if youre the most efficient competitor on a large scale then its axiomatic in my mind that youre going to end up over time with a very sound financial result and a very strong cash flow and a high return on capital employed which is what the objective of exxon mobil is raymond said return on capital exxon mobils return on capital employed an industry measure of how effectively a company manages its capital was two one percent last year the highest in the industry shells return was one nine five percent and bps was one six percent according to the companies from one nine nine zero to one nine nine nine exxon alone generated a return on capital employed of one two seven percent beating bp and shell which each returned nine four percent i believe they will continue to have the best returns on capital employed which ensures their premium valuation said denis walsh of bostonbased state street corp exxon mobils fourthlargest shareholder state street as of december held about seven zero million exxon mobil shares under raymond exxon mobil has focused on capital discipline it is one of just seven public corporations worldwide with aaa credit ratings by both standard poors ratings services and moodys investors service it can therefore borrow money at about six percent or less net debt at the end of two zero zero zero exxon mobil had six two billion in net debt which included one three two billion in debt and seven billion in cash thats about eight percent of its total capital compared with an average of one nine percent for the sp five zero zero two zero percent at other major oil companies and five zero percent for the oil industry analysts say in its entire one one nine year history exxon mobil has never been more able to deploy technology throughout its system say analysts thats because when exxon merged with mobil it also restructured the company instead of only rolling mobils assets into exxons existing corporate structure raymond and noto decided to set up an entirely new company organization changing from dozens of regionalbased business units into one one global businesses five divisions based in houston find and produce oil and gas chemical and coal operations are also based there and four divisions based in fairfax virginia make and sell fuels new ideas across old boundaries the new structure is designed to promote new ideas across old boundaries stephen hart who manages exxon mobils baytown texas refinery said one of the first steps in that process dubbed cold eyes involved sending mobil employees through his plants to see how they would do things differently the refinery north americas largest can process five zero eight zero zero zero barrels of crude oil daily it was like christmas being able to find out how each other did things hart said i know guys who have wanted to get into baytown for years sharing best practices doesnt always work during one of the coldeyes tours former mobil employees identified what they thought was a way to reduce the maintenance time on baytowns catalytic cracker a plant used to make gasoline to three five days from four five days hart says that due to unrelated issues they werent able to complete the maintenance that fast how to be attractive still the effort continues you have to be the lowestcost producer to be attractive in this business hart said one of the powers of exxon and mobil coming together is weve now got the best brains in chemistry refining engineering et cetera to figure out how to be the leader in every product we produce jim guerra an exxon employee for two two years said employees are linked by a former mobil tool called bestnet an intranet message system before the advent of bestnet if he had a problem with a catalytic cracking unit he was supposed to call a regional central engineer on the phone and ask for advice this could take up to a day if the engineer was in the field now guerra and employees like him use bestnet to post questions and instantly receive answers from colleagues around the world who have wide experience efficient deepwater drilling efficient deepwater drilling will be crucial to the companys financial future although oil and gas companies have begun to explore only half the known deepwater basins theyve already found the equivalent of more than four zero billion barrels of oil and over one zero zero billion more barrels remain to be found exxon mobil leads the industry in deepwater prospects with nearly eight zero zero blocks worldwide that cover more than one three five million acres an area the size of france next year the company plans to tap two fields near hoover and diana called marshall and madison that hold another four seven million barrels moving the company toward an ambitious goal of boosting worldwide production three percent a year through two zero zero five the company is also involved in nine other gulf of mexico discoveries in waters deeper than one three five zero feet that are currently producing or advancing toward development the companys geologists expect these fields to hold more than two seven billion barrels of oil and gas balance sheet in good shape because exxon mobils balance sheet is in good shape it can focus on finding other things besides debt reduction on which to spend the more than two zero billion in cash it generates annually generally the options include acquisitions capital spending stock buybacks and dividend increases analysts dont expect the company to make any sizable acquisitions until after the company sells off some of the assets it gained in the merger they will remain disciplined in their focus on return on capital employed and not spend their free cash flow unwisely said state streets walsh as of january exxon mobil planned to spend up to one three four billion on capital projects including developing oil fields and improving its refineries in two zero zero one up as much as two zero percent over last year though raymond wont say what exxon mobil plans to divest matthew warburton an analyst at ubs warburg in new york says the company will sell about one five billion of mobils old oil and gas fields annually sale of aera energy fadel gheit an analyst at fahnestock co says a prime candidate for sale is exxon mobils stake in aera energy llc a joint venture with shell in california that currently produces about two five zero zero zero zero barrels of oil and nine zero million cubic feet of gas a day exxon mobils share could be worth more than two billion investors will be surprised at the scope and size of the asset sales said gheit last year exxon mobil raised one seven three billion from asset sales required by federal regulators exxon mobil paid six one two billion in dividends or one seven six a common share up from five eight four billion or one six nine a year earlier the one eight th straight yearly increase that leaves stock repurchases for which the former exxon corp was famous from one nine eight three to one nine nine nine exxon repurchased more than one two billion of its common shares at a cost of about two six billion mobil purchased about seven seven million shares during that period for about three billion continuous buyback through the end of two zero zero zero exxon mobil purchased two six seven million shares at a cost of about two two three billion instead of announcing a level for buybacks like shells six billion goal exxon mobil buys continuously with shares as undervalued as they are ubs warburgs warburton said the company could repurchase one four billion of stock in two zero zero one because of the companys stature exxon mobil shares often serve as a proxy for the energy industry said michael labranche chairman and chief executive of labranche co as the companys specialist on the new york stock exchange labranche is responsible for raising the volume of exxon mobil shares traded on the exchange an average of about six three million of exxon mobils three five billion common shares outstanding change hands daily up from about five five million daily last year that kind of liquidity is good when a company is trying to attract large institutional investors fidelity and barclays exxon mobils two largest shareholders are fidelity investments and barclays global investors both of which sell many indexrelated funds many of these funds must own exxon mobil shares because the company makes up a large percentage of key indexes such as the sp five zero zero and the dow jones industrial average for example two seven three of every one zero zero invested in an sp five zero zero fund buys exxon mobil shares only general electric co at four one zero and microsoft corp at three zero seven get more of the investment exxon mobil shares make up five three two percent of the dow there are side effects to this status some investors use exxon mobils liquidity to treat the company like a bank buying the companys shares and holding them until their favorite stock starts to rise again this is something the company has to suffer through in part because of its status as a defensive or antitechnology stock exxon and the nasdaq when the nasdaq started to plummet in march one nine nine nine you could often use the indexs daily performance to track how exxon mobil shares traded for the day usually the relationship was an inverse one my wife has the view raymond said that when she looks at the stock market in the morning if she sees the nasdaq is up she says well im not even going to look at exxon mobil and if the nasdaq is down she goes hooray exxons up dont even need to look that may no longer be true as investors beaten down by the drop in the nasdaq so far this year search for companies that have earnings exxon mobil is the place to hide for the time being said allen ashcroft a portfolio manager with allied investment advisors inc this year exxon mobil is expected to earn four six zero a share or about one six billion according to first callthomson financial estimates range from three six five to five two seven a share or about one three billion to about one eight billion conventional wisdom the conventional wisdom is that exxons earnings last year were as good as it gets said fahnestock analyst gheit who used to be at mobil corp and who rates exxon mobil shares a buy but this old dog may have a few new tricks size doesnt always guarantee success for exxon mobil in march the company lost to bp a contract to build a liquefied natural gas terminal in china and the company after being slapped with a five billion judgment in its infamous valdez oil spill in one nine nine six has since become a magnet for other large judgments including a three five billion case related to natural gas royalties in alabama that the company has allegedly underpaid since one nine nine three raymond undaunted raymond remains undaunted putting mobil together with exxon gave us by far the largest asset base with more quality projects to do than anyone in our industry and you can be sure that were going to take advantage he said raymond has yet to convince many investors of that and he wont get the respect he craves on wall street until he proves that his enormous enterprise is smarter than its rivals not just bigger david wells in the new york newsroom two one two eight nine three three

natural gas by david buchan with prices for natural gas set to stay high lng seems to be back in fashion financial times apr three zero two zero zero one by david buchan if the us is a drag on the world oil market with its enormous imports placing strains on prices its newfound appetite for liquefied natural gas lng imports is wholly welcome in contrast to its effect on the oil market us demand is not raising the world price for gas because there is as yet no such thing but rather reflecting local north american hunger for gas at the same time us readiness to buy shortterm lng cargoes is adding flexibility and depth to a world market characterised by longterm contracts and an apparently rigid supply line of specialised tanker ships carrying frozen gas from one billiondollar terminal to another the us has introduced a new dynamic into the market says ron billings head of exxonmobils lng business but lng is an expensive business you need dollars one five bn to get going says dick de jong shells head of lng with dollars one bn needed to build one train or unit liquefying four m tonnes of gas a year and three tankers costing around dollars one seven zero m each to move the product and there have been false lng dawns before in the midone nine eight zero s when us importers of lng found the deregulated price of domestic natural gas slipping below that of lng they fought to wriggle out of their longterm lng contracts and mothballed their lng import terminals but with us natural gas prices double what they were a year ago and looking set to stay high the industry is scrambling to put the terminals back into operation the capacity of the largest at lake charles in louisiana is being expanded and bp and shell are buying capacity at cove point on the chesapeake bay which is due to start receiving lng next year after a gap of two decades bp chevron el paso phillips petroleum and enron are prospecting for sites for new import terminals on both coasts of the us the west coast has to rely on gas from the asiapacific region and the east coast on atlantic basin gas because most lng carriers are too big to pass through the panama canal right now lng only amounts to one per cent of total us demand says skip horvath president of the us natural gas supply association but it is very important to certain areas and it does not involve building extra pipelines which have become increasingly difficult to site in the us the us is also helping something like a spot market to develop in world lng of the three nine spot cargoes of lng traded last year many went to the us the upshot is that many companies are beginning to build a bit of spare capacity into their lng plants some companies such as bp are starting to order lng ships which are not tied to any specific lng contracts and which could therefore be available to carry spot cargoes contracts are also becoming more flexible as shown in bps recent contract to supply lng to the dominican republic at two zero years the contract was no shorter than the old norm but instead of pinning down the origin of the gas as is usual in lng contracts it allows bp to supply the gas from anywhere within its portfolio though the gas will probably come from bps plant in trinidad and tobago the export push of certain gasproducing countries is also conducive to the development of a more flexible market nigeria for example is very keen to abolish the flaring of gas that comes up with oil extraction and sees lng exports as the only feasible way of commercialising this gas its current lng gas is on longterm contract to europe but last year for instance the nigerian lng consortium of shell totalfinaelf and agip sold six spot cargoes to the us a consortium of us oil companies is looking at a second nigerian lng project egypt is another enthusiast for lng in the past six months it has signed three lng deals one with union fenosa of spain and two with angloitalian partnerships of bp and eni and of bg and edison like nigeria egypt appears to see the us especially with its current high prices as a useful supplement to its core european market but it is in asia that lng first started to overcome that regions long distances and lack of pipelines and it is still in asia that the big volumes of lng are traded whether the asian market becomes more flexible may depend on the balance in supply and demand in the asian region on the supply side large middle east lng producers notably qatar are making their presence felt alongside producers based in indonesia malaysia brunei and australias north west shelf qatars rasgas is rapidly expanding its capacity in conjunction with exxonmobil in particular to supply indias petronet with which it has the worlds largest lng contract of seven five m tonnes a year on the demand side india and china are clearly the big potential growth markets in a region where demand has been dominated by japan south korea and taiwan but they may prove difficult and slow to develop as enrons persistent payment problems in india have shown so the asian market may develop into the sort of buyers market that would allow for instance the big japanese utilities to negotiate the shorter and flexible contracts they want however there will be no revolution in lng says martin houston a vicepresident of bg though the share of lng traded short term could rise from eight to one two per cent by the end of the decade mr billings of exxonmobil concurs things are changing and maybe contracts will be shorter than two five years but when you look at the enormous

blocks bailout negotiations hit snag pge edison want end to price freeze if they sell transmission lines to state david lazarus chronicle staff writer wednesday march two one two zero zero one two zero zero one san francisco chronicle url httpwwwsfgatecomcgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchivetwo zero zero one zero three two one m none one four four five zero dtl californias nearbankrupt utilities are demanding that higher electric rates be a part of any deal to sell the state their power lines the chronicle has learned a rate increase perhaps of more than five zero percent according to earlier industry estimates would certainly draw a firestorm of protest from consumer groups and force gov gray davis to backtrack from earlier pledges that rates would remain unchanged nevertheless sources close to negotiations on the deal said pacific gas and electric co and southern california edison are attempting to make higher rates a condition for agreeing to a bailout scheme in which they would sell the state their transmission systems and some land the sources said the talks hit a new snag this week when state officials realized that fine print sought by the companies could require the public utilities commission to pass along all of the utilities costs to ratepayers the sources said this would end a rate freeze that shields consumers from runaway wholesale electricity prices the inclusion of potential rate increases in the talks reflects the growing complexity of a deal originally intended by davis to stabilize the finances of pge and edison so banks would resume loans to the cashstrapped utilities the negotiations subsequently have expanded to involve a state purchase of the utilities transmission networks and acquisition of utilityowned land including spectacular coastal property near pges diablo canyon nuclear power plant now they also have embraced further deregulation of californias dysfunctional electricity market clearly one of the terms being discussed is the regulatory environment said joseph fichera head of saber partners a new york investment bank that is advising davis in the talks the past situation has not worked well he added the utilities want some certainty about their future tentative deal with edison to date the governor has announced a tentative agreement with edison for the state to buy the utilitys power lines for almost three billion discussions with pge for a similar accord have dragged on for weeks an edison official asking that his name be withheld acknowledged yesterday that an end to the rate freeze is an expected result of the power line sale once the details of the pact are complete dominoes will fall the official said one of the dominoes is the rate freeze a pge spokesman declined to comment in fact both edison and pge have been aggressively seeking an end to the rate freeze for months the two utilities have a lawsuit pending in federal court demanding that the puc immediately raise rates so the utilities can recover almost one three billion in debt accrued as a result of the freeze they have been trying a lot of things to get the rate freeze ended in various forms said carl wood who sits on the puc adding it to the present talks is consistent with past behavior wall street has taken note that the negotiations no longer appear to be making progress paul patterson an energy industry analyst at credit suisse first boston told clients on monday that the discussions may have lost some momentum in recent days he did not give a reason for his part the governor sounded unusually cautious about the course of the talks when asked late last week if a breakthrough was imminent secret sticking points we are going to take the transmission systems and the land thats deeded and we will work out an agreement davis said at an appearance in san jose but there are a number of sticking points in the talks with pge that im not going to reveal one of those sticking points apparently is an insistence that the sale of utility assets include a longsought lifting of the rate freeze sources said lawyers from both pge and edison had inserted the related terms into draft accords affecting each utility and that the full impact of the additions was not realized by state officials until this week one source said the language was just convoluted enough to slip beneath the radar screen of state negotiators but the upshot once the words had been parsed was that the puc effectively would lose control over power rates creditworthiness on the table in edisons case the terms of the tentative deal include the governor asking the puc to support the creditworthiness of the utility this would ensure that future investments in both utility distribution and utility generation plants are provided fair returns of and on capital consistent with current authorized returns and capital structure provisions it says sources said the provision could be interpreted as a guarantee from the state that edison would be permitted to recoup all outstanding costs from ratepayers there may be some assumptions about this language that the rate freeze ends if it is adopted the edison official said adding that he saw no reason to disagree with such assumptions but fichera davis adviser in the talks insisted that nothing is set in stone and that the negotiations are proceeding without a hitch this is a very complex transaction he said god and the devil are in the details email david lazarus at dlazarussfchroniclecom two zero zero one san francisco chronicle pagea one,01:53:00,No

vote the customers were unwilling to give anymore on the enviroment issues and the democrats would similarly not back off their positions mid american then switched gears to pull out all the stops on getting labor support in order to trump the enviro supporters mid american put forward a proposal to the unionslegislators that they would commit to build two power plants in the state of iowa as opposed to developing in illinois over the next five years that would employ union labor mid american also had its top management making many visits this weekgreg abel and i believe also david sokol no warren buffet sightings yetthis offer created a flurry of activity on both sides but at the end of the day thursday the state ibew group let it be known that they would still not support the bill even with the mid am proposal mid american believes that the republicans now have a hook to force the democrats into voting for the de reg bill by saying that if they dont vote affirmative they are not for economic development in the ruralstruggling areas of the state where the power plants would be built while i may not share mid americans positive assessment the proponents group continues its

time but the general sense is that it will not be brought back up without at least two democrat votes guaranteed as is often the case in these debates the proponents continue to try many strategies but all of us agree that without direct intervention from governor vilsack the democrats will not come around as stated in my earlier message i am not optimistic about passage tempers are running very

reichelderferdubeesees subject iowa de reg update the iowa customer choice bill has run into some significant roadblacks the last few days due to the political maneuvering of the democrats as you will recall the house republicans have always stated that they needed democrat votes in order to bring the matter to the floor for a vote despite governor vilsacks stated support for the measure last week as well as last weekend the house democrat leadership is unwilling to push their members as they want to use this bill against the republicans in the house races this fall the tactic they will take is that residential rates will rise in the southeastern part of the state due to the republicans passing the bill the primary issue that the dems are using as a reason not to vote for the bill is that the enviromental protectionsfunds are not high enough the republicans are unhappy about the exhorbitant amount of funds and the rps that are already in the bill and are not willing to vote for an amended bill that the dems are pushing for the enviros and the unions are as they have been for the last six months the dividing force in this debate therefore the proponents coalition moved their efforts to the senate with the hope of getting a vote out this week and then move it back over to the house while we had a good commitment from senate leadership both dems and republicans on monday that support has eroded as of this morning we are trying a number of tactics and hope that there will be some positive movement today and tomorrow without the governor stepping up to the plate and encouraging the democrats to gather the number of democrat votes neccessary this week i am not optimistic about passage there are still twothree weeks of session left so this debate could rage until then but my sense is that if we dont get something out of the senate by the end of this week or early next week well be dead call if you have any questions six one two three three nine four five nine

houstonbusiness wirejan three zero two zero zero two the following is an advisory by industrialinfocom industrial information resources inc houston the rehabilitation of nuclear power generation plants which could represent part of the answer to worlds power generation needs over the next three zero years has taken a few steps forward in the consciousness of governments and industry in the past six months however nuclear power still has a way to go among environmental groups and those involved with postchernobyl public health concerns the pebble bed modular reactor pbmr from eskom in south africa continues to claim the attention of both the large power hungry regions and the capital conscious development areas to which the modular and smaller output plant could be both affordable and appropriate stakeholders in the project include the us company exelon with one two five eskom with three zero british nuclear fuels with two two five industrial development corporation of sa with two five and black empowerment at one zero currently exelon is negotiating for the possible purchase of four zero pbmrs at a price of around six billion usd early in two zero zero one the company requested the us national regulatory commission to start laying the groundwork for pbmr licensing exelon would like to see the three zero zero million demonstration unit which is planned by eskom in south africa as a proven model to show that all technical matters have been resolved and that safety efficiency and viability are proven enough for us regulatory agencies to proceed forward with licensing the plant is to be built alongside the existing nuclear power station at koeberg in the cape province of south africa with work commencing in two zero zero three if approved exelon may then start concurrent construction of us sites to bring pbmrgenerated power to market at the earliest possible date and at the best price specifications and claims by eskom who purchased the technology after a two one year development and proving period in germany present the pbmr as small safe clean cost efficient inexpensive and adaptable the pbmr uses multiple coated uranium particles encased in graphite to form a fuel sphere six zero mm in diameter the pbmr design makes use of helium as the coolant and energy transfer medium to a closed cycle gas turbine and generator the design differences between the pbmr and pressurized water reactors result in the pbmr being a safe and economical power plant the annual world market for power generation is estimated at seven zero billion the pbmr if it comes through its regulatory trials would be in a position to capture a tasty slice of this power action with one zero of the shareholding in the pbmr project reserved for new black empowerment shareholders one zero plant export orders a year could contribute nearly one billion a year to south africas gross domestic product and another one billion in export income an estimated five seven zero zero zero direct and indirect jobs would be created these figures would double and triple for two zero or three zero orders annually if the demo plant achieves its targets eskom will place an order for one zero modules with the exelon order hopefully kicking in immediately for a possible date for the first us plant in two zero zero seven eskom will sell pbmrs as a manufactured item with no rights given eighty percent of the costs will be made up of the manufactured reactor and two zero site construction related the aim is for four zero of the sourcing to come from south africa taxpayers money approximately five zero million so far is being spent by the south african authorities in giving all due diligence to the studies and to public feedback on the project before the go decision is given with this right and proper concern and the considerable market presence of eskom and exelon the one three zero mw modules will no doubt play a crucial role in the future of nuclear power generation the project managers are indicating growing confidence in their ability to bring the product to market and have recently made a significant move a contract has been placed in midjanuary two zero zero two with the us company stone webster and south african construction company murray roberts and black empowerment contractor proman management services to provide consulting services to the pbmr project in engineering procurement construction management and project management following this development the pbmr management at eskom have gone on record to state that with the multinational

edition copyright two zero zero zero the times mirror company by james flanigan lets be clear the fact that the state botched the job of deregulation to begin with is one reason californias electricity market is such a mess but failure to build a single new power plant in the state even as californias economy expanded its use of electricity is the basic cause of todays shortages and soaring prices in san diego orange county and other areas still some simple steps can be taken by regulators legislators and gov gray davis to provide immediate relief the states major utilities should be free to buy power wherever they can get it they should not have to buy exclusively from the power exchange the pasadenabased power pool that was set up by the one nine nine eight deregulation to achieve auctionbased prices for roughly eight zero of the states electricity approval should be expedited for adding smaller generating plants that supply power at times of peak demand that could alleviate a tight supplydemand situation over the next year or two while larger plants are built long term the state needs to speed up the approval process for building new electricity plants the state also should force utilities to invest in the stillregulated system of power transmission lines which now has weaknesses in the san diego and san francisco areas perhaps the most glaring fact about californias electricity problem is how few companies have stepped up to supply power to this enormous market the nations biggest only one five or so suppliers including federal agencies the states own utilities municipal companies and private generating firms supply power to californias system by contrast pennsylvania which has an electricity market less than one two the size of californias has one three zero separate suppliers of electricity today reports john quain chairman of that states public utility commission its no coincidence that pennsylvania has seen monthly electric bills drop three on average since deregulation its worked out terrifically quain says what did california do wrong it allowed the states major utilitiespacific gas electric southern california edison and san diego gas electricto recover one zero zero of their unrecovered or stranded costs for nuclear and hydroelectric plants and for past power purchase schemes mandated by the california legislature to encourage alternative sources of energy then californias legislators told the utilities to sell their conventional power plants to private generating companies all of which would sell their power to a central power exchange the california scheme was flawed at once overregulated and yet commercially clueless in not foreseeing trouble from a single power pool fed by only a handful of suppliers how did pennsylvania do it it allowed the states utilities to recover no more than six seven of their stranded costs for nuclear plantsreasoning that company shareholders should accept some of the risk of their investments and rather than set up a central power exchange the state allowed its utilities and newcomers to the states electric system to compete for business competition after all is what deregulation is supposed to encourage and competition is not happening in california it should be noted that the summer is relatively cool in the east this year and extraordinarily hot throughout the west all the western states are suffering electricity problems thats another reason for californias trouble normally two eight of californias electricity comes from us and canadian government systems and from utilities in oregon and washington nevada and arizona but this year because of lower hydroelectric supplies and higher demand from booming economies in those other states power for california is in shorter supply and more expensive when the state can get it now there are accusations that some suppliers to california have taken advantage of their market leverage to extract premium prices for power theres nothing illegal in angling for a better price or in using futures markets and other trading techniques as some generators may have done if any stepped over the line to illegal collusion federal and other investigations will determine the facts but who gave the generators the market leverage to exploit us the california regulators legislators and utilities did told to sell their generating plants in one nine nine eight the utilities sold dozens of plants in package deals of two and three to single buyers they received premium prices from buyers such as aes corp duke energy southern co reliant energy dynegy and nrg the premiums were paid for the market leverage that multiple plants afforded the buyers nobody in the utilities reckoned that they were handing market leverage to potential commercial adversaries nobody in the legislature or the regulatory staffs reckoned that the central power exchange could be held

after the recent big runup had pushed the market into oversold territory i would not be surprised to see more of a downside correction soon prices pushed to a fresh fourmonth high tuesday resistance

took a rest after they hit a new contract high tuesday feeders are still overextended on a shortterm technical basis a bull flag looks to be forming on the daily bar chart as this week we saw an upside breakout from that pattern first resistance is seen at nine two zero zero looking at the weekly continuation chart for nearby futures the next upside objective for the bulls is resistance just above nine two zero zero first support is seen at nine one zero zero august lean hogs closed up one six five today at six three three five prices closed near the session high the strong rebound continued today after limitup gains seen tuesday the market just got too extended on the downside especially in the wake fridays bullish usda hogs pigs report fund buying was featured today sources said prices today broke out above and negated a steep fiveweekold downtrend the bulls now have the nearterm edge however i would not be surprised to see some sideways consolidation in the coming sessions next resistance lies at six four zero zero first support is located at the six two zero zero level grains july corn futures closed up three four cent at one nine zero today it was a quiet rest day today after prices tuesday scored another fresh contract low funds have loaded up on the short side now good growing weather in the midwest and no threatening weather patterns in the forecast continue this market has no summertime weather premium built into it which will make it very susceptible to an upside spurt even with a minor weather scare i dont think there is much downside left in corn but i dont want to be a bottompicker eithertempting as it may be at these low prices next support is seen at one eight seven three four next resistance is seen at one nine five july soybeans closed one three four cents lower at four three seven one two today technical damage occurred in the market this week as a fiveweekold uptrend line on the daily bar chart was penetrated on the downside and negated now it also looks like a minor doubletop reversal pattern could be playing out on the daily bar chart good growing weather and no weather threats on the horizon have allowed the bears to take control of this market funds have been good sellers in the bean pit this week still more downside action this week would not surprise me first support is seen at the four three five area first resistance is now seen at four four five level july soybean meal closed off one six zero at one six zero two zero today another down day today negates a fiveweekold uptrend line on the daily bar chart bears are gaining steam now after prices pushed to a fresh fourmonth high friday they have seen a solid downside correction this week bulls need to stop the bleeding soon or this weakness will quickly become more than a downside correction next support comes in at the one five eight zero zero area first resistance is seen at one six two six zero todays high july bean oil closed six points higher at one four eight zero cents today todays followthrough buying has confirmed a key reversal up after prices pushed to a fresh contract low on tuesday and then staged a strong rebound this week spreaders are unwinding short oil and long meal positions oil is still technically much weaker than beans or meal but i would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil next resistance comes in at one five zero zero cents next support is seen at one four six zero cents july chicago wheat closed three four cents lower at two six four today prices closed near the session low as traders looked at slack demand prospects earlier in the session prices were boosted by heavy storms that hit kansas and oklahoma the past two four hours first support lies at the two five eight one two levelthe contract low next resistance is seen at two seven zero kc july hrw wheat closed up one cent at three two zero one four today prices gapped higher today in the wake of the heavy storms that hit parts of the plains the past two four hours however prices closed on the session low still the upside gap was not filled with the late retreat also there was followthrough buying today and a key reversal up on the daily bar chart was confirmed recently this market has seen a series of v reversalsboth up and down trading remains volatile next resistance is seen at the three two five level next support is seen at three two zero july oats closed up one two cent at one one two one four today prices closed near the session low today as did wheat the choppy activity at lower price levels also favors the bulls the past three weeks have seen another minor uptrend develop on the daily bar chart oats will continue to look to corn and wheat for direction next resistance comes in at the one one four level first support now comes in at one one zero softs july ny sugar closed one five points lower at eight five nine cents today prices today dropped to another fresh fourweek low as the recent higher volatility at higher price levels has proven bearish also the rare and usually bearish broadening formation continues to play out on the daily bar chart bears have the technical edge at present however the market is overdone on the downside at present on a technical basis next support comes in at eight four zero centstodays low first resistance is now seen at seven seven two centstodays high july ny coffee closed six five points lower at five nine one five cents today prices today came within one zero points of the contract low set in april bears rule bulls can only hope for a strong rebound from the present price level which would signal a big doublebottom reversal still given the upcoming frost season in south america i suspect the downside from present levels will be limited in the coffee market speculative shortplayers wont want to get too brave at this time of year first support comes in at the contract low of five eight eight zero cents first resistance is now seen at six three zero zero cents july ny cocoa closed three nine lower today at nine six four more technical damage was inflicted by the bears today as prices hit another fresh threeweek low as there was followthrough selling from fridays gaplower trade the bears are in control but the market is shortterm overdone on the downside at present next support comes in at nine five five first resistance is now seen at one zero zero nine todays high july cotton closed three two points lower at four zero seven two cents today prices hit a fresh contract low just yesterday in the wake of a bearish usda cotton consumption report last friday cotton is in a strong bear market and any rebounds will be selling opportunities for the bearsfor now my bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming process next support lies at three nine nine five centsthe contract low first resistance is seen around four two zero zero cents recently i put december new york cotton futures on my radar screen for a potential longside trade in the coming weeks but first and importantly this market has to me show solid strength including some basing activity at these lower levels july orange juice futures closed nine zero points higher today at eight zero four zero cents trading has turned volatile lately but it still favors the bullish camp bulls pushed prices to a fresh threemonth high just last friday prices are still in an uptrend on the daily bar chartalbeit a choppy one next resistance is now seen at eight two zero zero cents next support now comes in at seven nine zero zero cents july lumber futures closed the limit of one zero zero zero lower today at three two two three zero what goes up must come down a vtop reversal is playing out in lumber i still would be surprised if the upside fireworks are over the market was way overdone on the upside and this still could be just a big correction before stillhigher highs are scored expect more volatility in the near termon the upside and downside the next upside objective for the bulls is the three five zero zero zero level first support is seen at three one five zero zero metals august comex gold futures plummeted by seven seven zero to four two six seven four zero an ounce heavy long liquidation and stoploss selling were featured in the pit the recent commitments of traders report showed the small speculators had loaded up on the long side of gold futures recently today those weak longs were coughing up their positions news wire reports could offer no fundamental reason for the collapse in prices technically once gold dropped to near the two seven zero level basis august comex futures the door was open for stoploss selling and general long liquidation a big vtop reversal has now formed and played out on the daily bar chart pit reports said there was not much fresh short selling interest wednesday once again the gold bulls mustered the strength to show an impressive upside move only to be kicked in the teeth when a lack of followthrough buying interest at higher levels prompted a price vacuum on the downside there is a support level around the two six four area basis august futures if that level gives way then the next support comes in at the two six zero area this market is now shortterm oversold on a technical basis next resistance on the upside is seen at the two seven five area for bulls to really get back on their feet they must push prices back above the two nine zero level if volatility persists it will favor the bulls july silver closed off zero zero nine five today at four four four five an ounce like gold long liquidation and stoploss selling hit silver today and it was prompted by the sell of in gold prices have now backed well off last weeks high and could be forming a vtop reversal on the daily bar chart bulls today lost much of their momentum they had gained that saw prices push to a threemonth high still the recent increase in volatility is suggestive of a bottoming process in silver next support is seen at four four zero first resistance is now seen at four five zero july ny copper closed off four five points today at seven six two five cents the sell off in the precious metals has impacted copper this week while this deals the bulls a nearterm setback the higher volatility at lower levels does favor the bulls my bias is still that the lows are in place for copper next support is seen at seven five zero zero cents next resistance is seen at seven nine zero zero cents energies july crude closed off zero one four at two eight five two today prices this week are correcting from the big beating they took late last week bears still have the edge and in fact a bearish flag or pennant pattern may be forming on the daily bar chart next resistance is seen at two nine five zero next support lies at two eight zero zero july heating oil closed two points lower today at seven seven eight four prices are still correcting downward after they last week hit a fresh eightmonth high bulls still have the edge next resistance is seen at eight zero zero zero cents next support is seen at seven seven zero zero cents july unleaded gasoline closed one three nine points lower at nine four five zero today prices closed near the session low as the bears gain confidence a rare and usually bearish broadening formation is developing on the daily bar chart this increase in volatility at higher price levels suggests a topping process in the market next resistance is seen at one zero zero first support is seen at nine three zero zero july natural gas closed two zero cents higher at four zero one today prices today saw a decent rebound from a technically oversold condition the market is still oversold on a shortterm technical basis prices hit a fresh ninemonth low just tuesday bears still have the big advantage next support is seen at three six seven todays low first resistance is seen at four two five stocks financials currencies the june euro currency closed one zero points higher at eight five six seven today bears are in control as prices hover near the recent forthemove low in fact a bearish pennant pattern may be forming on the daily bar chart measuring implications of that pattern should a downside breakout occur point to losses to the eight three zero zero area bulls only hope is that last weeks low of eight five zero two can hold the losses next support is now seen at eight five zero two next resistance is seen at eight six five zero the june japanese yen closed one nine points lower at eight three two eight today prices pushed to a fresh twomonth high last thursday and are this week consolidating those recent gains the recent push higher moved prices out above the congestion area that had trapped prices for about two and onehalf months bulls still need to show some more upside strength before i am confident in calling this an upside breakout next resistance now lies at the eight four three three level first support is now seen at the eight two zero zero level the june swiss franc closed eight points higher at five six two five today like the euro bulls want to see last weeks low hold up before they can gain any momentum at all and like the euro a bearish pennant pattern could be forming on the daily bar chart measuring implications on a confirmation of the pattern point to losses to the five four zero zero area a five monthold accelerating downtrend line is in place on the daily bar chart next support is seen at the five five eight eight levellast weeks low first resistance comes in at the five seven zero zero level the june australian dollar futures closed four five points lower at five one two four today prices pushed to a fresh three month high last week and bulls can argue we are seeing corrective consolidation this week still downside price action last week penetrated on the downside and negated a sevenweekold uptrend line on the daily bar chart bulls should be worried about this they need to show some fresh momentum soon first support is seen at five zero six nine first resistance is now seen at five two two five the june canadian dollar closed three three points lower today at six four six nine prices closed near the session low if prices drop below the may low of six four two five then bears will be on a level playing field with the bulls this currency had been near recent historic lows and i do not think there is much more downside in fact a wedge pattern may be forming on the daily bar chart that if confirmed would likely favor the bulls next resistance is seen at the six five three five level first support is now seen at the six four five zero level the june british pound closed four two points higher at one four two six four prices are rebounding after last thursday prices fell below the early april low of one four one one two if there would have been followthrough selling then the door would have been open to steeper losses if the losses can be contained and prices rebound one could still argue that price action the past few weeks has been a basing before prices eventually turn north next resistance is seen at the one four three zero zero level next support now comes in at the one four one five zero level the june us dollar index closed three points higher at one one eight three one today bulls are still in firm control in fact a bullish pennant pattern could be forming on the daily bar chart the index last week pushed to a fresh multimonth high if bulls can push prices above and have a close above the one one nine zero zero level then there is likely significantly more upside potential to this rally even though the index is still a bit shortterm overbought technically there is stiff resistance basis the longerterm charts at the one one nine zero zero area next resistance lies at the one one nine zero zero area first support is seen at the one one seven five zero area september us tbonds closed seven three two higher today at nine eight two zero three two the market is consolidating at lower levels bears still rule the next upside objective for the bulls is the par levelone zero zero even but any nearterm rebound

the western energy markets are currently in a pricing crisis power supply shortages and threats of system blackouts have resurfaced this winter in california and spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy headache for the west gas prices along the pacific corridor from kingsgate in the north to topock in the south have jumped to over four zero zero zero per mmbtu during december after averaging over one five zero zero per mmbtu through the second half of november extreme weather strong power demand for gas and unusually low gas storage levels have combined to intensify the demand for pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity bottleneck in bringing gas to this far western corridor the result is prices that dramatically disconnected from the rest of the north american gas market in a way that is more typical of northeast markets during the winter the vulnerability to additional spikes will endure as the demand drivers combined with weakened storage inventories will maintain price pressure on western price points throughout the winter however the recent jumps in western gas market differentialsto more than a one zero per mmbtu premium to the henry hubshould ease somewhat with a break in the weather under any weather scenario spikes up into the one five zero zero two zero zero zero per mmbtu range will be a feature of winter markets along the west coast on balance we expect west coast price differentials to average at a four zero zero eight zero zero per mmbtu premium through winter the spring hydroelectric runoff season should offer the first opportunity for a break in differentials that could drop back to more typical levels of less than one zero zero per mmbtu over the long term increased pipeline capacity and additional gas supply are needed to break the vulnerability to future west coast price spikes however significant new capacity additions are still one two to two four months away in the meantimeparticularly this wintersustained high and volatile price differentials and extremely high absolute prices at western points are likely to draw the increased attention of state regulators and the ferc as winter heating demand exposes residential customers to the direct cost of the crisis building up to the price spike the first signs of natural gas price spikes and disconnects emerged this summer as sharp yearoveryear increases in demand pushed pipeline utilization rates to new highs as pipeline capacity constraints into california became evident differentials in southern california moved up to a one zero zero per mmbtu premium to the henry hub these extremely high prices as well as low forward spreads discouraged storage injections through the summer as a result a strong storage position early in the summer deteriorated rapidly from may through july in august a lateral on el pasos southern system exploded the accident further limited pipeline capacity into california for a twoweek period during that time the market drew heavily on storage inventories and further weakened storage positions as hydroelectric generation declined through the summer the price strength extended into northern california malin which had been pricing near parity with the henry hub in the summer began trading at a zero five zero per mmbtu premium to the henry hub in september the summer and early fall market set the stage for continued and more intense spikes this winter the following factors are now driving this market continuing surges in gas demand gas demand levels have remained high since early summer driven by higher overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric output demand levels for the third quarter in the us west averaged one zero seven billion cubic feet bcf per day up from eight seven bcf per day during the third quarter one nine nine nine persistently strong gasfired generation production through the fall months diverted gas to power production frustrating efforts to fill storage this pressure will continue the yearoveryear demand increases from the power sector will be compounded as evidenced in november by swings upward in residential and commercial heating demand of eight zero zero million cubic feet mmcf per day overall cera expects nearly one six bcf per day of increased demand in the west this winter with the critical california and pacific northwest regions showing one two bcf per day of increased demand key power sector drivers including the strong economy colder weather and lower hydroelectric generation will continue to push gasfired generation pipeline utilization nears capacity strong western demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western pipes to high levels flows from british columbia into the northwest pipeline have remained at high levels since summer while flows from the rockies on northwest have remained at pipeline capacity flows on pgt into kingsgate have remained at or near capacity although approximately three zero zero mmcf per day of excess capacity exists on pgt into california at malin likewise flows out of the rockies on kern river pipeline have consistently remained at capacity the only slack pipeline capacity remaining for west coast gas markets has been on southwest pipes during the past few months these pipelines have operated at their highest utilization rates since the addition of capacity from canada early last decade the high utilization of western pipeline capacityreminiscent of power plant capacity constraints that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the west this summerleaves very little slack capacity to provide a relief valve for demand spikes and that is exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks see figure one given the level of storage inventories and expected gas demand flows on the el paso and transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher flow levels from december through march than they have averaged through november deteriorating storage position at the start of november california storage inventories held at one five four bcf a full three two bcf below the fiveyear average inventory level the strong instate withdrawals during november weakened that position to one two eight bcf the deficit swelled to six two bcf inventories in california have never fallen below six zero bcf so deliverability through the end of winter is likely less than seven zero zero mmcf per day storage inventories in california are so low that utilities ability to balance withdrawals from storage with purchases from demandsensitive price points is severely limited if the cold weather blast anticipated for mid december materializes this effort at balance will be even further compromised for the remainder of winter see figure two shortterm contracting a significant amount of western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market a shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline capacity to spot transactionsin many cases in response to gas and power industry deregulationhas left the west much more exposed to spot market volatility in other areas of the country utilities have significant firm pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the citygate andor have forward purchased gas at previous and lower prices for at least some portion of their winter supplies as a result unlike in eastern markets a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of california utilities will be exposed to the current price spikes no alternatives a lack of fuelswitching capability prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas prices power prices continue to move in lockstep with the increase in gas prices not surprisingly gas prices pushed the cost of gasfired generation beyond the federal energy regulatory commissions fercs proposed price cap of one five zero per megawatthour setting the stage for a reassessment of this price limit a small and declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel capable significantly air emissions restrictions already plaguing power markets with much higher emissions credit costs this yearwill make any further switching to liquid fuels in the crucial california market highly unlikely this winter a recent meeting of the south coast air quality management district which has jurisdiction over the los angeles area concluded with no relief granted to generators running short of emissions credits market forces unite for price spikes during november the first cold weatherrelated demand spike demonstrated the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability of the western markets a cold weather system in mid november brought temperatures averaging four seven percent colder than normalthe temperatures actually averaged one four percent colder than a normal january weekand provided the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery systems on the west coast capacity constraints on moving gas into california that appeared during the summer extended north into the pacific northwest as heating loads climbed this core demand compounded the effects of continued strong demand for gas for power generation the high power demand was the result of the intersection of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power plant outages gas demand in the us west during the last two weeks of november was boosted to approximately one five five bcf per day driven by heating demand increases of two eight bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage related demand increases of one zero bcf per day these demand spikes caused buyersalready dependent on the spot marketto bid citygate prices to record high levels through the last two weeks of november and into december since demand outstripped supply prices rose dramatically at all western price points and flows of natural gas to western markets increased over high summer levels citygate prices surged beyond four zero zero zero per mmbtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly one five zero zero per mmbtu for december bidweek at topock daily spot gas prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many western market regions west coast to remain disconnected through the winter although the week of november one three could prove to be the peak demand week in the west this winter cera does not expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the west coast any time soon storage inventories are so low that the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities generators which already rely heavily on the spot market for supplies are faced with a bidding war for scarce supplies colderthannormal weather would likely keep west coast prices in the two zero zero zero four zero zero zero per mmbtu range more normal weather would allow a slow decline from current levels of over two zero zero zero per mmbtu down into the one five zero zero two zero zero zero per mmbtu range however the storage situation and underlying demand strength mean that any return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early january this winter will prove a critical test for western gas markets and the end of the heating season will likely provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in the west coast market as heating loads diminish significantly in march and storage deliverability is no longer a critical issue premiums should retreat back into the one zero zero two zero zero per mmbtu range as hydroelectric generation begins to increase the pressure could subside even further but storage injections during the spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines even during the spring the unique vulnerability of the pacific northwest the west coast price pressure is not limited to california high demand in the pacific northwest and more indirectly in california will keep upward pressure on prices from sumas to stanfield northwest pipeline capacity from the rockies was already fully utilized at the onset of the cold weather and even so can only provide gas so far into the pacific northwest the combined california and pacific northwest demand pushed stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are bidirectional there the only supply source for the load centers in southern british columbia and even more so in northern pacific northwest such as seattle are from westcoast at sumas the westcoast mainline from the producing fields in northeast british columbia has also been operating at capacity the same bidding forces felt in california have been evident at these western canadian price points pushing sumas prices into the two zero s per mmbtu these forces will persist keeping sumas at a premium to aeco over the winterand in much closer relationship to california prices customer response another log on the backlash bonfire with power plants and gas utilities paying the current high spot prices consumers bills from vancouver to san diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity prices the gas industry has been preparing for rate shock this winter warning regulators and customers alike however the price spikes in the west and the sustained premiums in western markets move beyond alarming capacity holders are reaping significant rewards for their investments in capacity positions resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from consumers to capacity holders market power and market gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will find easy application in their gas market counterpart no matter what their merits some level of investigation into the natural gas markets during or following this challenging winter should be expected as has occurred in the power markets this will now turn attention to gas purchasing practices particularly in california the likely outcome of this process will be a shift away from the heavy reliance on spot purchases toward a more flexible portfolio approach end follow url for pdf version of this alert with associated graphics come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweektwo zero zero one
