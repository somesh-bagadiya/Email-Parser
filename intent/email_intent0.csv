material has yet to be finalized our expectations are detailed within one cautioning investors to avoid stocks with california exposure until a more longer term solution is decided upon however the lowest risk is likely in the cheapest stocks and duk may be the best bet over the week or so dyn in the midthree zero s and ene in the midsix zero s are also attractive two duke energy conference call reiterated that about nine zero of california portfolio is hedged forward with nonutilities or in transactions outside of the independent system operator iso or power exchange px we estimate dukes financial exposure is less than zero zero four per share annually discussionthoughts on california and brief comments on the duke energy conference call key representatives of the california utilities power generators marketers have been in meetings in washington dc with the ferc chairman secretary of energy us treasurer and members of the clinton staff we have the following comments on what we believe may be and should be longterm solutions to the california energy crisis what we think will come out of washington meetings one power generators will agree to selling power under longterm up to one zero year contracts at the capped retail rates six five seven five megawatt hour mwh assuming that they can buy gas supply forward however that market is very illiquid and can take weeks to secure a transaction two politicianslegislators want to avoid bankruptcies but we still think there is a five zero five zero probability three utilities likely to be able to buysell electricity in forward market four california is likely to eliminate the power exchange px and replace with negotiated buysell market five forbearance brings up issues of whether the utility can defer payments for power supply for a number of periods or whether the state will pick up the bills the impact on the receivables of the power generatorsmarketers and lenders is uncertain six we believe actual seizure of power plants from the unregulated suppliers by the state is unlikely as is the removal of emissions credits also we understand nox emissions credits can be as high as four six megawatt hour in california seven resignation of reigning ferc commissioner jim hoecker on one one eight zero one allows for bushappointed commissioner to step in most likely to be republican curt hebert herbert has been vehemently opposed to price caps and supports competitive markets eight under a new ferc we think there is a low risk of retroactive repercussions on generators to give back past profits on electricity sold in california last summer and also that a windfall profits tax on generatorsmarketers is unlikely nine companies such as duk dyn and ene all appear to have less than zero zero five per share of annual earnings exposure to california generationmarketing sales net of risk mitigation however recent conversations with reliant energy have revealed that it has not hedged its receivables risk with the utilities in california typical monthly receivable balances range from five two seven zero million or up to zero six zero of earnings exposure rei is betting on the risk of bankruptcy of pge and edison is unlikely and therefore the cost to set of credit reserves at this point would more than outweigh potential earnings exposure one zero while these stocks in addition to rei appear oversold the stock performance is likely to be volatile until a solution to the ca energy crisis is introduced in our view the california market solutions fall short of the big picture i have been cautioning investors to avoid the abovementioned stocks until a more longerterm solution is decided upon however the lowest risk is likely in the cheapest stocks and duk may be the best bet over the week or so still dyn in the midthree zero s and ene in the midsix zero s are also attractive in our view one one we expect dyn duk ene and rei to all report positive four qzero one earnings surprises of at least a penny or so but to the extent that the surprise is related to power generation the stocks may not react favorably what we think will solve the california problem one eliminate all retail rate freezes and let the market forces balance supply and demand higher electricity prices to the consumer will encourage less use and the purchase of more efficient energy equipment and will also encourage independent generators to build new facilities two we agree with the allowance of forward sales and a free spot market for unregulated electricity transactions three a word on the hydroelectric generators most are governmentowned facilities that virtually generate electricity for free it would stand to reason that the hydroelectric generators aka the federal government has been financial benefiting from selling free power into a market that has been marginally priced off of highpriced natural gas shouldnt the government also be asked to share the pain following highlights from duk call one duke controls or owns three three zero zero megawatts of electric generating capacity out of a portfolio of about six zero zero zero megawatts about nine zero of its california portfolio is hedged forward with third parties that are not utilities or in transactions involving the independent system operator or power exchange two dukes receivables at risk are not material financially or operationally according to the company duke pointed out that just over one zero of ebit is generated from its wholesale energy business although we estimate it is closer to one five three duke has a minimal number of contracts with pge and socal ed eix subsidiary four nothing material has been agreed upon in the washington meetings between industry representatives legislators and feds but the likelihood of power plant seizures and retroactive penalties appear unlikely five we estimate duks annual financial exposure net of forward sales is less than zero zero four per share

httpwwwthestreetcom_yahoocommentdetoxone four two two seven eight one html why one firm thinks enron is running out of gas by peter eavis senior columnist originally posted at five two three pm et five nine zero one on realmoneycom a small research boutique with a reputation for rigorous analysis is telling clients to quickly dump enron enenyse news believing that the energy trading giants two zero zero one earnings will fall well short of wall streets forecasts cambridge massbased off wall street led by analyst mark roberts thinks enrons two zero zero one earnings will fall six cents short of the consensus estimate of one seven nine the firm also believes enron stock should trade around three zero nearly five zero below wednesdays five nine two zero the firms two six page report published may six highlights enrons declining profitability and increasing leverage and suggests that the company should trade on the same sort of multiple as a trading firm like goldman sachs gs nyse news which has a two zero zero one pricetoearnings ratio about half of enrons three three times ows also alleges that enrons earnings quality is poor and that key parts of its financial statements are confusing and opaque houstonbased enron didnt comment by publication time on elements of the report that detox sent the company an energy analyst who is bullish on enrons outlook says the ows report contains fundamental misunderstandings about the energy market and enrons business model but he says the report does include some groundbreaking and valid insights the analysts firm doesnt give stock recommendations economies of scale why care what off wall street writes compared with say analysts at merrill lynch mernyse news for one ows has an excellent track record particularly sweet was two zero zero zero when the tech stocks it had bashed came crashing down it has also shown itself to be well ahead of the curve recommending that clients sell etailer pricelinecom pclnnasdaq news in june one nine nine nine when faith in internet stocks was at its blindest and their prices at their most insane pulling back enron retreats after long rally enron with its domination of a burgeoning energy market annual revenue of over one zero zero billion and impressive earnings growth can hardly be ranked alongside the likes of priceline but ows thinks enron is set for a precipitous drop nonetheless why owss main beef is that key profitability measures are in decline margins on enrons pretax operating earnings which the companys earnings releases call ibit or income before interest taxes and other items are falling total ibit of seven nine five million in the first quarter amounted to only one five nine of the five zero billion in revenue for the period compared with a two zero eight margin in the fourth quarter and four seven five in the yearearlier period revenue in the first quarter was nearly quadrupled from the yearearlier period yet ibit rose only two seven this shrinkage is due to lowermargin trading income making up an increasingly large share of enrons revenue base ows thus calculates that for the remainder of two zero zero one enron needs to generate an extra two one billion in revenue for each additional penny it makes over its two zero zero zero eps of one four seven to reach analysts expectation of one seven nine the energy analyst counters that ows apparently hasnt grasped how enron can continue to increase earnings even when margins shrink it does so simply by increasing volumes as the energy market balloons in size in other words margins may decline but since revenues are so much higher earnings still go up illustrating this firstquarter two zero zero one eps of four nine cents was two three ahead of the yearago figure even though the ibit margin shrank by three two percentage points the analyst thinks enron will make one eight two per share in two zero zero one growing on you in addition the huge growth in the energy market that has so helped enron is likely to continue for several years according to the analyst he notes that roughly seven five of the electricity available in the us still isnt traded in a market eventually it will be part of a competitive environment but itll take five to one zero years says the analyst and he believes the extreme volatility in energyrelated commodities that has also benefited enron will exist for longer than ows projects still owss point on profitability is bolstered by other profit measures return on capital net income as a percentage of equity plus debt was six six in two zero zero zero down on one nine nine nine s six nine and well below the two zero zero zero returns on capital at duke duknyse news one one eight dynegy dynnyse news one two one and even goldman eight nine even enron bulls will admit that its financials are hard to follow for example it doesnt give a gross margin number for its wholesale services or trading business which accounts for nine six of revenue but one area of the companys financial statements registered with the securities and exchange commission that consistently bugs analysts is the part that describes enrons related party transactions which are the deals it does with entities that have some sort of link to the firm in fact one of the related entities that enron has traded with is headed by enrons cfo andrew fastow the energy analyst comments why are they doing this its just inappropriate the reason for maintaining these hardtofollow related party deals has been a source of speculation but ows analysis shows how a sales of optical fiber to a related party may have been used to goose earnings in the second quarter of two zero zero zero estimated profits from the socalled dark fiber optical cable without the gear to send data over it transaction allowed enron to beat analysts secondearnings earnings estimate by two cents a share rather than missing by two cents how soon before wall street follows off wall street on

dallasnewscoms colleges sitetwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine chip shotstwo zero zero nine two zero zero nine zero nine after listening to oklahoma coach bob stoops news conference on tuesday two zero here are some selected quotes i thought readers might find interestingtwo zero zero nine zero nine on the season so far and how the team has changed from last yeartwo zero zero nine zero nine were excited about the position were in being four zero and were a confi denttwo zero team going down to dallas we are more mature we understand more we play two zero harder and are better conditioned and stronger than a year agotwo zero zero nine zero nine on having four turnovers in last years game with uttwo zero zero nine zero nine turnovers were a major factor we had two interceptions that hit us ri ghttwo zero in the chest and we drop both of those interceptions led to scores fortwo zero themtwo zero zero nine zero nine on uts quarterback rotationtwo zero zero nine zero nine i dont bother to speculate why they do something or not they run the sametwo zero offense with both major applewhite and chris simms im sure well see atwo zero good part of applewhite i know who our starting quarterback will be and two zero hell be in there the whole go unless something happenstwo zero zero nine zero nine on ous running gametwo zero zero nine zero nine i hope our running game is a factor in this game were quite a bit mo retwo zero confident in our running game because weve emphasized ittwo zero zero nine zero nine on going up one seven zero in the first quarter and then losing last years gam etwo zero three eight two eight two zero zero nine zero nine we set the tone early last year and didnt finish the tone theres no two zero protecting a lead for three quarters and major applewhite made some throws two zero you watch on film that you cant believetwo zero zero nine zero nine on ou having lost three straight to texastwo zero zero nine zero nine we get emails and letters we know what the situation is and we need totwo zero win two zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine two zero zero nine longhorn q atwo zero zero nine q i heard rumors that the royalmemorial stadium will one day be the two zero largest stadium in terms of seating capacity in the country seating some two zero one one four zero zero zero folks whats the chance of this happening in the near term two zero zero nine waxer dallastwo zero zero nine zero nine brown well former ut regent tom hicks owner of the dallas stars and two zero texas rangers wants it done and is willing to help pay for it so there is atwo zero good chance some movement on this could happen in the next few years uttwo zero would start by expanding and closing in the north end of royalmemorial th entwo zero the focus would turn to the south endtwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine imagetwo zero zero nine kalen thornton two zero zero nine zero nine q what happened to adam doirontwo zero zero nine morris w collie houstontwo zero zero nine zero nine brown adam doiron was initially projected by ut defensive coordinator carltwo zero reese to be the top defensive end of the freshman class he thought doiron two zero would be the best run stopper of the bunch and since thats an area texas two zero wants to improve reese figured doiron might play early on but de kalentwo zero thornton moved ahead of doiron during the preseason and now reese istwo zero considering redshirting doiron doiron recently started working at defensiv etwo zero tackle and if any more players go down at that position doiron could see two zero playing time the coaches like him but might want to build for the future bytwo zero holding him out this seasontwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q i was very happy to see some positive things from our offense in the two zero second half especially the running of kenny hayter but i have a question two zero about the punt teamtwo zero zero nine zero nine its obvious that opposing teams philosophy is to not call fair catch itwo zero first noticed this against nebraska last year and i certainly think that two zero making an early tackle by invading the halo and receiving a five yard penal tytwo zero is much better than sitting back and possibly allowing a big return zero nine zero nine but if were going to get the penalty why not lay our ears back and po p thetwo zero receiver in the mouth whether hes caught the ball or not a big hit would two zero make that penalty a little easier to swallow dont you thinktwo zero zero nine cody anderson houston texastwo zero zero nine zero nine brown no question about it first you want to try to avoid getting t hetwo zero penalty but if you are going to get the penalty then get your moneys wor thtwo zero and give that returner something to remember for next timetwo zero zero nine zero nine i hate this rule colorado coach gary barnett went so far as to say that two zero against a team with great returners such as kansas state who has davidtwo zero allen its better to violate the halo rule and tackle these guys take the two zero five yard penalty and keep them from breaking one six zero or seven zero yards for a score two zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q it seems like ive been waiting forever for the offensive line to cl icktwo zero did something come together finally or have i not been paying attention i two zero am out of state and am limited to tv and had to miss one gametwo zero zero nine jerry secretstwo zero zero nine zero nine brown no things did click in the second half of the oklahoma state g ametwo zero the running game used a gapblocking scheme that focuses more on blocking two zero angles than individual players on running plays the guard opposite the pl aytwo zero side was pulling and creating some room for cutbacks mack brown said the two zero team had used the gap scheme in the past and it just didnt work but last two zero saturday it didtwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q will sean rogers play on saturdaytwo zero zero nine rick bush dallastwo zero zero nine zero nine brown i think its doubtful rogers didnt practice tuesday and was s tilltwo zero seen with his walking boot on to protect his sprained ankle but im sure h etwo zero and the coaches will evaluate his status right up until game time those hi ghtwo zero ankle sprains can be a nightmare if they dont heal properly however no o netwo zero wants to rush him back and then lose him for the season because his return two zero was prematuretwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine imagetwo zero zero nine josh heupel two zero zero nine zero nine q ou has a great passing attack do you feel that texas young secondar y cantwo zero answer the call two zero zero nine marty wagnertwo zero zero nine zero nine brown this is the battle of the game in my opinion ous receivers v stwo zero uts secondary if ou quarterback josh heupel goes unpressured the uttwo zero secondary might need therapy after this game but rod two zero zero nine zero nine babers and quentin jammer have made progress each game if lee jackson i stwo zero back hell play strong safety and greg brown would move from ss back to two zero free safety that means dakarai pearson goes back to the nickel back which two zero in this game is good news for ut you need pearson in the game as much as two zero possible in my opinion he breaks on the ball better than most of utstwo zero dbackstwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q how do you see the texasoklahoma game shaping up what will be the keystwo zero zero nine sara wilsontwo zero zero nine zero nine brown i think the offenses are equal so it will come down to who pla ystwo zero the best defense i think texas has the better defense even without shaun two zero rogers so i see texas winning two four two zero turnovers will change the complexion two zero of the game of course but i think ut is catching ou at the right time aft ertwo zero picking up some muchneeded confidence on offense against oklahoma state two zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q now that the quarterback experiment should be officially over at tex astwo zero do you expect major applewhite to start and play the entire game against ou two zero also looking ahead to next year because this year it is no longer an issue two zero do you think major applewhite would be a legitimate heisman trophy candidat etwo zero if he were to start every game and take nine zero percent of the snapstwo zero zero nine zero nine my two cents i think the texas coaches better start treating major two zero applewhite like one of the best college quarterbacks in the country which hetwo zero obviously is and start treating chris simms like the secondbest quarterba cktwo zero at the university of texas which he might be i say might because i haven ttwo zero seen chance mock play in a game he might be better than simmstwo zero zero nine clint mickeytwo zero zero nine zero nine brown major applewhite will start against oklahoma based on repetiti onstwo zero with the first team in practice this week and i would be shocked if hetwo zero doesnt play most or all of this game in fact i think major will play mos ttwo zero or all of the next two gamestwo zero zero nine zero nine if ut beats ou the colorado game will be one of those nightmare games two zero because ut will be fighting a letdown and the buffaloes will probably still two zero be winless the bufs play at azero two this week so these next two games are alltwo zero about experience but i think simms will be back in action when ut takes on two zero missouri on oct two one because the coaches are sticking with the notion oftwo zero having two starting quarterbackstwo zero zero nine zero nine i think applewhite would be a heisman trophy candidate this season if he hadtwo zero been the lone starter its just impossible to think of yourself as the bes ttwo zero player in the nation i would think when your coaches dont think youre t hetwo zero best qb on your own teamtwo zero zero nine zero nine as far as next year you would have to think the coaches are going totwo zero continue this rotation because they have not backed off of it much thistwo zero season well see mock is still two years away unless applewhite or simms two zero gets injuredtwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine imagetwo zero zero nine major applewhite two zero zero nine zero nine q its become obvious to everyone outside mackworld that major applewhi tetwo zero has established himself as the one and only starting quarterback at texas ittwo zero has become ridiculous to call both quarterbacks starters and insist ontwo zero token starts for chris simmstwo zero zero nine zero nine it seems to me it would be less demeaning to simms to name applewhite as thetwo zero starter and bring simms in for quality playing time during the game instead two zero of allowing him two series then yanking him in favor of the real starter w hotwo zero then plays the rest of the game the current charade hasnt fooled anyone astwo zero fine as simms two zero zero nine zero nine talent appears to be this is majors team any comments two zero zero nine rowell rogers dentontwo zero zero nine zero nine brown i talked to major oneonone on monday and he said he didnt two zero realize how much confidence he had lost this season until he got the infusi ontwo zero of confidence by leading texas on five straight scoring drives of the secon dtwo zero half against oklahoma state if the coaches are insistent about thistwo zero rotation it will be interesting to see if applewhite can continue totwo zero maintain or build on the confidence he seized in the osu game two zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q what is happening with special teams i know they have had some rece nttwo zero success after missed tackles and have improved but what i cannot understan dtwo zero is why the opposing team can get so close to kris stockton and ut withtwo zero superior recruiting and athletes can not even get close this has really two zero hurt us how is our blocking so different why does this problem persist two zero zero nine chad dieterichstwo zero zero nine zero nine brown it sure appears to me that the players on the line are giving w aytwo zero too much ground after the snap almost every punt this season has been atwo zero matter of can stockton get the punt off before the opposing team collapses two zero onto stocktons pockettwo zero zero nine zero nine mack brown gets very upset with questions about the punt team he says t hattwo zero they use the same formation that every nfl team uses and that special teams two zero are prone to breakdowns because there arent enough scholarships to recruit two zero special teams players and he says young players have to be used becausetwo zero veterans get tired playing offense and defensetwo zero zero nine zero nine i asked mack if he thought that members of the punt team were starting t otwo zero have a mental block now that two punts have been blocked this season he two zero said he didnt know he said the latest punt block against oklahoma state w astwo zero the result of osu players twisting and a ut player failing to pick up the two zero assignment at least this time the punt blocker didnt run untouched throu ghtwo zero the middle of the linetwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine q i think people get too caught up in whats happening right now to re alizetwo zero what this team will be in a year or two all weve heard about is howtwo zero wonderful macks recruiting has been and how loaded we are yet how thetwo zero oline is less than impressive and how the qb situation is hurting ustwo zero zero nine zero nine guess what most of these great players are only one eight remember ricky as atwo zero freshman didnt think so think about how solid we will be in two years wi thtwo zero current players and the new recruits coming in so if we lose another game ortwo zero two this season and end up in the poulan weed eater independence bowl no two zero biggietwo zero zero nine zero nine in a year or two well be right in there so heres my question what w illtwo zero it take for texas to be consistently rated up there with the great college two zero programs right now as a friend of mine would say we have a good team and two zero were building a good program it seems that texas is heading in thattwo zero direction but we have a little way yet to go what does texas need to be a two zero true top one zero team is it personnelbased or is it about chemistry two zero zero nine alex kephart dallastwo zero zero nine zero nine brown i think it has to do with chemistry and experience at this poin ttwo zero the talent is there mack brown is recruiting winners but each of the line stwo zero has to have experience and there have to be some bravehearttype leaders two zero on the teamtwo zero zero nine zero nine right now the offensive line is still growing even though it has two two zero seniors the defensive line has great senior tackles but the ends are raw two zero so the defensive line probably wont be great again after this year for a two zero couple years if you believe that you need senior lines to win a national two zero championshiptwo zero zero nine zero nine but i agree with you texas has all the makings of being a powerhouse in steadtwo zero of just a good team in the next two to three years everyone will put the two zero longhorns back up in the top five next year because of their schedule but tex astwo zero will be a veteran team with great depth in the next two to three yearstwo zero zero nine zero nine right now texas and its fans and even the media have been guilty metwo zero included of holding texas to the same standard as nebaraska and floridatwo zero state but thats probably not fair just yet the stud players brown istwo zero recruiting need time to settle into the system and get some experience in two zero the next couple years texas will justifiably be held to the same standard astwo zero the perennial powerstwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q i have two questions for you chip a does the university still ha vetwo zero the longest scoring streak in ncaa football b if i find myself looking at two zero next years schedule after a payback loss at stanford do i need profession altwo zero help ps you may also want to remind your readers we should never feel two zero guilty about running up the score against u of htwo zero zero nine arland bishoptwo zero zero nine zero nine brown texas has scored in a big one two record two three one straight games dating backtwo zero to a one six zero loss at baylor in one nine eight zero that is the secondlongest active streak intwo zero the nation byu holds the longest scoring streak three one eight gamestwo zero zero nine zero nine next years schedule is even more appetizing than this years schedule thetwo zero only nonconference road game is at houston the nonconference home games two zero are new mexico state and north carolina and the big one two schedule has colora dotwo zero in austin ut will have oklahoma in dallas as usual and texas azero two at kyl etwo zero fieldtwo zero zero nine zero nine so no you dont need therapy if anything next years schedule should betwo zero another reason to have patience with this years team good times aretwo zero obviously on the horizontwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q i know the subject has been worn into the ground but i havent hear dtwo zero this view from anyone so in the midnine zero s florida state was struggling two zero early in the season with a young talented qb named charlie ward of course two zero they were winning the early games against lesstalented teams but justtwo zero barely then they finally put ward in the shotgun on virtually every down two zero and let him do his magictwo zero zero nine zero nine it was like night and day basically what they did was abandon their m oretwo zero balanced attack and did what their talent dictated they could do pass ear lytwo zero and often the run was still used but it was more to complement the pass two zero zero nine zero nine i know ut is not in the exact situation but this may make sense for the mtwo zero the only time i thought the ut offense looked really good this year was rig httwo zero when major applewhite first came in against louisianalafayette and drove two zero straight down the field and major took almost every snap in the shotgun attwo zero least the first drive i know it was against an inferior opponent that was two zero probably taken by surprise but they showed more on those drives with major two zero in the first and second quarter than they have the rest of the season so two zero fartwo zero zero nine zero nine i believe you can win in college football with an unbalanced attack fsu hastwo zero done it with primarily passing and i cant begin to name all the ou andtwo zero nebraskatype teams that have won conferencenational titles withtwo zero onedimensional offenses also the shotgun helps majors biggest liability two zero his mobility personally i dont care which qb is used this season in th etwo zero shotgun or not but i really wish mack brown would just choose one and stic ktwo zero with him two zero zero nine aaron ruhnowtwo zero zero nine zero nine brown i think you will continue to see the shotgun used only in speci fictwo zero situations the texas coaches are too committed to being a balanced offense two zero that can run out of multiple sets i do like the shotgun the buffalo bills two zero used it all the time while they were going to all those super bowls you ca ntwo zero do a lot with it but it probably wont become a fixture in austintwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q do you think that the pressure and expectations of texas fans are go ingtwo zero to be too much for mack brown to handle it appears he is already crumbling two zero if he thinks people are hammering him now what will it be like if he drops two zero this years game to azero two and suffers four lossestwo zero zero nine mike mcdonaldtwo zero zero nine zero nine brown i hope it wont be too much for mack brown hes a good perso n andtwo zero works really hard i think he needs to just let some of this stuff wash ove rtwo zero him and forget about it i think he has gotten into a rut lately where he two zero senses that every question has negative overtones so now he is answering two zero every question by acknowledging his critics with some kind of remarktwo zero zero nine zero nine he has done more for texas than ut will ever know he has reshaped the two zero mindset of the university with the positive outlook he has brought to the two zero football team games are selling out players are coming to austin the kid stwo zero for the most part are good kidstwo zero zero nine zero nine theres no need for mack to draw a line in the sand and allow a few nega tivetwo zero voices to bring him down or cast a shadow over all the progress he has made two zero if he moves on the media and the critics will move on too if he harps on two zero criticism and keeps bringing it up in his answers the media has notwo zero alternative but to report it it becomes a wicked circletwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q david aaron was a receiver that came out of marshall a few years bac k itwo zero know he also went to ut for track but he was a great receiver in high schoo ltwo zero i saw him on the sidelines a few times but he never got much playing time itwo zero was thinking he should be a senior this year do you know what ever happene dtwo zero to himtwo zero zero nine jeff marshall texastwo zero zero nine zero nine brown aaron is just running track this year he has left the football two zero teamtwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q is it just me or does the football field look a little bit torn up ittwo zero just looks really dry and during the game a lot of turf gets thrown uptwo zero zero nine mark vtwo zero zero nine zero nine brown ut officials say its the drought and the fact that the ut team two zero practices on the field on thursdays but i agree i think the field looks two zero worse this season than it did last season and we had a drought and the tea mtwo zero practiced on it last year tootwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q what is up with all the negative press that mack brown and the horns havetwo zero been getting lately from exercising their right to buy out of the hawaii two zero game to losing their chance at a national title to running up the score in two zero the u of h game and finally to wanting the u of h game moved from a high two zero school stadium to a real college stadium where real fans can see a football two zero game zero nine zero nine im not sure about dallas but here in houston mack and co have been ge ttingtwo zero drilled for everything i listed above and more qb rotation it just seems two zero like everyone in the media and even some our own fans want to findtwo zero something negative to heap on the program zero nine zero nine in my opinion mack and the rest of the team do not deserve this mack histwo zero coaches and the players have been nothing short of genuine and upfront wit htwo zero the media and the public they have expressed confidence but never boasted two zero about their greatness in fact they have been the epitome of humility do two zero you have any thoughts as to why this is occurring hook em two zero zero nine marty murray class of eight two baytown texastwo zero zero nine zero nine brown it does seem to be a ridiculous truth that when we build someth ingtwo zero up we inevitably end up tearing it down maybe the sense is that thetwo zero storybook season of one nine nine eight and the victory over nebraska last year built up t ootwo zero big of expectations the three losses at the end of last year did nothing t otwo zero burst the bubble and then when ut comes out flat this year everyonetwo zero reevaluated and said wait they really arent that good zero nine zero nine mack brown had been telling people to reduce their expectations but whe n thetwo zero star falls people want to be the first to say its falling then they wan ttwo zero to add their own wrinkle as to why its falling so people look for cracks intwo zero the foundation to bring uptwo zero zero nine zero nine its like in political campaigns the media tends to build up a candidat e andtwo zero then when the first negative story comes out they reevaluate and if some two zero bad trends continue that candidate gets torn to shreds it all feeds ontwo zero itself but inevitably there is a settling period zero nine zero nine i think the people who are quick to say that texas isnt as good as we two zero believed will calm down and there will be another story to cover plus tex astwo zero may get hot win all of its games and then this brief bout of criticism wi lltwo zero have been for naught but sometimes criticism can be good for a coach and h istwo zero team he can use it as bulletin board material to get the team going well two zero see how mack brown and the vocal minority of critics handle things fromtwo zero here two zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q do you think chris simms would have benefited from a redshirt year itwo zero realize we were thin at quarterback last year and it was probably not antwo zero option but i look back at major applewhite and it appears to me he benefit edtwo zero from a redshirt year in which his only responsibility was to learn thetwo zero system when he came in as a redshirt freshman he was ready to go thanks two zero for your insightful newsletter two zero zero nine michael r johnson houston texas two zero zero nine zero nine brown sure i think most players benefit from a redshirt year unless theytwo zero are michael vick there was no way a redshirt season was going to happen fo rtwo zero simms however simms wants to spend just four years in college and uttwo zero coaches needed a backup for applewhite there is no question applewhitetwo zero benefited from his redshirt seasontwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q im really sick of all this negative stuff from a vocal minority of two zero fairweather fans they sound like a bunch of whining aggiestwo zero zero nine zero nine having said that i still cant help but wonder if we dont have a probl emtwo zero with our offensive line coach according to the ut media guide coach tim two zero nunez has had very little experience as an offensive line coach prior totwo zero coming here he didnt play that position either there is no track record oftwo zero having actually developed a line since he inherited experienced lines at two zero both marshall and uttwo zero zero nine zero nine this group clearly hasnt improved even though it was a major source of two zero concern after last season nunez may be a fine coach and a great recruiter two zero but does anyone think that he is one of the top oline coaches in thetwo zero country is he the one who we want developing the fine group of incoming li netwo zero recruits we have committed for next yeartwo zero zero nine zero nine brown patience dont fire a coach before it gets to midseason if t hetwo zero offensive line doesnt show any progress by the end of the year then its two zero time to talk about whether coaches have done their jobs nunez was coaching two zero this line when it beat nebraska last year so lets give him some time to two zero work with these guystwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q whats the scoop on playing uh at robertson stadium next year can t exastwo zero a la hawaii threaten to cancel the game with houston unless it is played intwo zero the astrodome or rice stadium also how can either school afford to give u ptwo zero the lost revenue that would result from a robertson stadium game even if two zero they do put in an extra one zero zero zero zero temporary seatstwo zero zero nine chris barbee el campo texas two zero zero nine zero nine brown this is a price texas will pay for trying to rekindle some semb lancetwo zero of an old southwest conference matchup after ut canceled the hawaii game itwo zero doubt they will actively seek to change next years schedule it will be an two zero intimate setting shall we saytwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q i live in odessa and i use to see roy williams do punt returns why nottwo zero let him return some puntstwo zero zero nine zero nine brown mack brown doesnt like to put freshmen back on punt returns un tiltwo zero at least midseason after midseason he argues that freshmen arenttwo zero freshmen anymore so perhaps after midseason if ut is not making anytwo zero progress on punt returns well see some new faces back there i would love two zero to see what williams can do although i doubt that coaches would put him ba cktwo zero there and i would really like to see nathan vasher back there heck i wou ldtwo zero like to see nathan vasher everywhere from what i have seen the kid istwo zero fearless with tons of confidence well seetwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q before the utoklahoma state game i thought that mack brown would s tarttwo zero shuffling the quarterbacks less often giving them a quarter or two instea dtwo zero of two or three series each in order to begin to establish some sort of two zero consistency in your sept two five column you also said this should happen i ntwo zero the game chris simms started but was pulled early after an interception two zero and applewhite played until well into the fourth quarter the tv announcers two zero even wondered aloud if simms was hurt in some way since he didnt get back two zero in until late in the gametwo zero zero nine zero nine my question is was this a message to simms in some way due to his poor two zero early performance or was this somewhat scripted in advance in order to giv etwo zero applewhite the reigns it certainly appears that the coaches have moretwo zero confidence in applewhite based on the situations they put him in two zero zero nine rick highfill naperville illtwo zero zero nine zero nine brown i sincerely think that the coaches have been trying to give sim mstwo zero every chance to thrive and possibly win the job after four games its cle artwo zero he hasnt won the job outright now coaches have to decide if this rotatio ntwo zero is really the best thing for the team and its leadership i think they will two zero rely more on applewhite in the next two games and thus kind of disprove the irtwo zero own theories about having two starterstwo zero zero nine zero nine the hard part about the public relations in this situation is that once youtwo zero say you have two starters its a real blow to one once you say that you no wtwo zero only have one starter i think the coaches will continue to say they have t wotwo zero starters and play simms out of fear of an injury affecting applewhite itwo zero dont know if thats the right answer applewhite grew on the job without a nytwo zero game training before richard walton went down in one nine nine eight so who knowstwo zero zero nine zero nine i would think the coaches will again rotate after the ou and colorado ga mestwo zero because they will face teams missouri baylor texas tech and kansas that two zero they will probably be favored to beat at that point if youre ut you jus ttwo zero hope that the rotation doesnt hurt the teams offensive progress heading two zero into the azero two game and postseasontwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q is there a start time for the colorado game and will it be on tv two zero zero nine marcus phillipstwo zero zero nine zero nine brown the colorado game will be at two three zero pm central time on oct one four buttwo zero the game will not be on tv not even on payperview if you want to see th istwo zero one you gotta get out to bouldertwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine

six five nine pm subject bea enron nondisclosure agreementletter mark thanks for the feedback i think that the only open issue is the section five nonsolicitation provision bea has a corporate policy against nonsolicitation commitments primarily because of the administrative burden in keeping track of such obligations of course it would be extremely short sighted of bea to target a customers employees the only way that bea could consider any such commitment would be to make the provisions mutual as a practical matter bea is more at risk of having a customer solicit its employees who are experts with the bea software in which a customer is interested than is our customer whose employees are experts at the customers business in which bea is not engaged i have attached a revised draft of the nda letter in which i have incorporated your feedback and added in a mutual nonsolicitation provision does this work for you regards steve markgreenbergenroncom wrote steve thanks for the comments here are my responses one introductory paragraph section a is unacceptable as this places an administrative burden on enron that currently does not exist section b is acceptable two paragraph three changes are acceptable three paragraph four changes in this section are acceptable however it is enrons strong preference that no indemnity language be included four paragraph five deletion of this provision is unacceptable five paragraph six this deletion is fine six paragraph seven this change is acceptable seven paragraph nine this change is acceptable if we still need to discuss the

right to choose a new power provider may disappear today by robert t garrett the pressenterprise sacramento only a year or two after california lunged to the head of the pack in deregulating electricity the state now seems headed in virtually the opposite direction government is in the drivers seat by summers end the state may end up with more control of the electric industry than was true for several decades before a flawed deregulation plan was passed in one nine nine six today for example the state public utilities commission is expected to put an end to what was supposed to be a hallmark of the one nine nine six law the ability of residential and business customers to shop for a new electricity provider in august a new state consumer power and conservation financing authority comes into being it will be able to borrow five billion to build or subsidize new power plants make old ones cleaner and more efficient and help homeowners and small businesses take energysaving steps at a senate hearing wednesday on the future shape of the electricity market democratic lawmakers aides to gov davis and consumer advocates spoke favorably of a strong state role in planning and coordinating the generation and transmission of electricity never again will we embrace the free market said david freeman davis leading energy adviser we want something of a hybrid with government restraints on market forces but state chamber of commerce lobbyist dominic demare said businesses fear policymakers are about to trample innovation and consumer choice also the chambers members want the state out of the business of procuring electricity he said in january the state began buying power for customers of californias three investorowned utilities which had been caught between soaring wholesale prices and capped retail prices the state has signed four three billion in longterm contracts but many witnesses at the senate energy committee hearing extolled a greater role for the state than simply the buyer of last resort lenny goldberg a lobbyist for the utility reform network a consumer group said the state should work toward permanent price caps on wholesale power public ownership of all transmission lines and regulation of retail prices that shields residents and small businesses from gyrating prices freeman a longtime advocate of public power said the longterm contracts and new state authority will help ensure a comfortable cushion of supply then we can permit market forces to play a vigorous role he said sen debra bowen dmarina del rey suggested the state should make sure its electricity supply always exceeds demand by one five percent or more bowen said the price of building the extra generation could be considered insurance against blackouts and be spread across all customers in the state the chambers demare said he would prefer to leave decisions about new generation to the free market but are you willing to live with the results if the market does not come up with adequate supply bowen asked you cant have it both ways stuart wilson assistant executive director of the california municipal utilities association warned that the state may bite off more than it can handle in trying to be a major power buyer a regulator and a subsidizer of new power plants its pretty complicated right now and its getting more

bradford is our teams most valuable player hes one of the those guys who turns the field over he really changes field position bradford told me he has always wanted to play for the longhorns he was a full qualifier out of lufkin high school and said he will transfer to texas in january so he can go through spring training with the longhorns he is the longhorns one seven th commitment but he can be counted against last years class because he will enroll at midyear coach mack brown said monday the longhorn coaches are going to look at personnel across the board to try to find players who can help get the team back on the winning track brown said the six three one four loss to oklahoma was my worst day as a coach but he said he has to get the team playing well in a hurry to have a chance to beat colorado in boulder saturday he also said he expects the team to bounce back strongly my job this week is to be hard be tough but to give them some hope he said this is the wrong week to be going to boulder they changed quarterbacks and he freshman craig ochs played great at am colorado also has the best offensive line weve played this year its going to be a big challenge brown also said the longhorns need to develop an identity on offense he said he wants to be able to run the ball better but said the horns have done better from the shotgun with four wideouts than with anything else they have tried this year he also hinted he might quit using his twoquarterback system but said the coaches always talk to the players before making any statement to the press the buffs are a one point favorite and brown said the longhorns who have played well in our stadium and played poorly away from it need to play their best game of the season to win he said dt shaun rogers who has missed the last two games with a sprained ankle is much better and probably will be able to play saturday all america dt casey hampton said getting rogers back would really help the defense when shaun is in

as promising as we first thought thanks gary original message from smith amanda d sent thursday may two four two zero zero one five five nine pm to fergus gary s cc molland michael e meringolo peter subject enron response to criminal charges gary our earlier preliminary research reflected the fact that although it will likely be difficult it may be possible under the primary jurisdiction doctrine to refer criminal charges to ferc given the criminal penalty provisions of the federal power act however as it becomes more clear that if criminal charges are to be filed they will be filed in california it is necessary to revisit and expand this earlier research we noted earlier that there is a body of substantive law dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine but no case which considered this question with respect to the federal power act specifically based on this we concluded that it may be possible if difficult to argue that criminal charges should be referred to ferc under the primary jurisdiction doctrine an expansion of this research reveals that this potential for referral appears to only be applicable to federal criminal charges state criminal charges are not removable under two eight usc section one four four one which provides that except as otherwise expressly provided by act of congress any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction may be removed by the defendant or the defendants to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending moreover our research has revealed no case in which state criminal charges were referred directly to any federal regulatory agency however our research has revealed another alternative to removal or referral of criminal charges see generally sprint corp v evans md al one nine nine three eight one eight fsupp one four four seven sprint corp v evans md al one nine nine four eight four six fsupp one four nine seven in one nine nine three the attorney general of alabama began an investigation of sprint corporation an international telecommunications company acting as a common carrier within the meaning of the federal communications act sprint among other things provided a one eight zero zero service to subscribers pursuant to tariffs filed with the fcc to use these one eight zero zero numbers a caller places a call through a local telephone company who connects the call to a long distance carrier such as sprint who generally then connected the call to the one eight zero zero subscribers local telephone number in february one nine nine three sprint received a subpoena from the montgomery county grand jury commanding it to appear and produce all records relating to the one eight zero zero service sprint produced the documents and learned that it was under investigation for violation of alabamas obscenity laws in connection with allegedly obscene content distributed over telephone lines in march one nine nine three sprint filed a motion for a temporary restraining order tro and a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the alabama attorney general from pursuing a criminal indictment against sprint for violation of the obscenity law sprint maintained enforcement of the antiobscenity law would interfere with federal statutory rights because regulation of interstate communications is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the fcc at the tro hearing the attorney general could not testify that the prosecution was not imminent and therefore the court issued the tro later in march the court decided sprints motion for a preliminary injunction sprint corp v evans md al one nine nine three eight one eight fsupp one four four seven at the hearing on this motion counsel for the attorney general stated that the attorney generals position regarding sprints criminal liability under the obscenity statute related to the its obligations under that law when a telephone customer complains that a one eight zero zero subscribers message is offensive according to counsel if a customer complains sprint is obligated to either report the complaint to a prosecuting attorney or begin a declaratory judgment action against the subscriber the district court granted the preliminary injunction the court held that under the relevant eleventh circuit test for determining whether a preliminary injunction should issue the movant must show one a substantial likelihood that she will ultimately prevail on the merits two that she will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues three that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party and four that if issued the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest sprint eight one eight fsupp at one four five two before the court considered the first element of this test the court addressed the contention that the district court had no jurisdiction the court held that the supreme court however has held that federal courts have federalquestion jurisdiction under two eight usca s one three three one to entertain suits to enjoin state officials from interfering with federal statutory rights the court then held that there was a substantial likelihood that sprint would prevail on the merits because to the extent that the alabama antiobscenity statute attempts to impose reporting requirements on communications by common carriers it is interstate in nature and preempted by federal law the statute is being used as a mechanism to impose new reporting requirements on common carriers with regard to their eight zero zero service currently under federal law common carriers do not have an affirmative obligation to investigate whether their facilities are being used by customers for a lawful purpose importantly the court did not reach the question whether the communications act preempts all alabama laws imposing liability for conduct of common carriers in the area of obscenity the court also rejected the attorney generals argument that a younger abstention was necessary the court disposed of the last three parts of the preliminary injunction test easily first the court held that irreparable harm would result because an indictment against sprint would cause great harm to its business reputation and would jeopardize its status as a government contractor second the court held that the potential harm to sprint outweighed the potential harm to the attorney general because although the attorney general relies on a state statute directed at the prosecution of the distribution of obscene matter the attorney general really seeks to impose interstate reporting requirements on common carriersin other words the generic proceeding at issue is the regulation of interstate telecommunications by common carriers outside the context of the distribution of obscene matter the attorney general clearly has no interest in such interstate regulation third the court held that the preliminary injunction serves the public interest by ensuring that the national interest in fulfilling the goals of the federal communications act sprint eight one eight fsupp at one four six zero six one in a separate decision almost a year later the district court granted in part sprints motion to refer certain issues to the fcc under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction sprint two eight four six fsupp at one five zero one prior to this motion the alabama attorney general changed its allegations regarding the illegality of sprints conduct under the obscenity law now alleging that sprint was not criminally liable because of a failure to report but because of a aiding and abetting theory the district court held in brief that one referral to fcc under primary jurisdiction doctrine was warranted with regard to question of whether common carriers consistent with communications act may refuse to carry information providers program transmitted as one eight zero zero service if program contains sexually explicit information that has not been adjudicated obscene and two referral to fcc was not warranted with respect to question of whether attempted criminal prosecution of interstate common carrier under states antiobscenity laws for knowingly transmitting potentially obscene or obscene telephone communications through its interstate one eight zero zero facilities is preempted by communications act sprint two eight four six fsupp at one four nine seven the court then ordered that the record of the case be transmitted to the fcc that the preliminary injunction remain in effect and that all motions would be denied without prejudice until after the fcc rendered its decision obviously no analysis of the criminal charges against enron can yet be made but there is a significant chance that enron may be able to cast any criminal charges filed by the california attorney general as regulatory in nature moreover given relative lack of effect the alabama attorney generals change in position in the middle of the sprint case the regulatory aspect of the charges may not be as important as it may seem in the first sprint holding on the preliminary injunction please let me know if

proposed dstar delay is neither surprising nor unreasonable it was always ridiculous to think that the dstar board would be able to put togethers a complete ferc filing by one two two nine zero zero so the three month delay on the tariff filing is ok the board seems very committed to making that filing as to the startup date it was always ridiciulous to believe that the entire software and hardware system new ems all market software etc could be put into place by one two zero one the one two zero two date is in my opinion both aggressive and achievable one thing to keep in mind as to the ferc filing dstar already exists dstar is operated by an independent board not by the transmission owners thats already a big improvement over the other wouldbe rtos on the other hand the transmission owners have not yet agreed to sign onto dstar by signing a tca but i believe that this will happen what is critical is for ferc to respond to the one zero one six nine nine rto filings by demanding that the final rto filings include rto authority over all fercjurisdictional sevices including interconnection at every voltage level if ferc does this the utilities will fall in line on the other hand if ferc doesnt take a hard line there will be big debates and we may end up with sham rtos another thing to keep in mind as to implementation dstars plan is to consolidate control areas

the other parties folks realize at some point weve got to make a decision that not everyone will be happy with raezer said establishing a rate design has been difficult for desert star members because half the transmission facilities in the region are owned by federal power marketing agencies taxexempt utilities and cooperatives that arent subject to ferc jurisdiction raezer said and current rates differ dramatically according to a draft letter from desert star to ferc however the jurisdictional utilities and the salt river project agricultural improvement and power district have made a

frankel jonathan cohen louis subject order eight eight eight argument please think about the following two zero in a two zero minute supreme court argument the limit will be strictly observed one needs to be ready to answer questions of all sorts but one cannot co unt on being able to make more than two three points and each of them needs to b e clear from the first sentence points that require development dont work in light of that two zero one should i plan to spend any minutes on the new york side of the case ie arguing that all transmissions over the grids are in interstate co mmerce and ferc has jurisdiction whether the ensuing sale is wholesale or r etail on the one hand the ny issue is more important to enron than th e enron issue on the other hand my sense is that we are way ahead on th e ny issue after the briefs and the sg will likely do a good job on it in argument my sense is that i should be prepared if necessary to utter so mething like the starred portion of the first sentence of this paragraph a nd to defend it against any questions but should not otherwise plan to get into these issuestwo zero we should probably also have a canned sentence ready to address nys wacky preemption argument which the one that it relied on most heavily in its op ening brief two zero two i think my most important tasks are to make clear that i this case is about fercs power to require nondiscriminatory access to the interstate grids and not about rates or state regulation of retail sales and ii i t is important to the nation that ferc have such power i need to make the se points quickly and vividly in a way that the justices will carry away that is going to be hard because theoretical abstractions are not vivid examples take too long to develop and provoke quarrels about details and m etaphors are generally too inexact please consider whether i am right abo ut the two points being most important and think about how to make them i think these points are the most important along with making the court c omfortable with the idea that if they adopted our position they would not b e turning upside down a federalstate regulatory division thats been in pl ace for six zero years two zero two zero three although in a formal sense our case turns on the chevron issue plain language no ambiguity hence no room for discretion my instinct but i am not at all sure about this is that i should not plan to devote time to these matters first they are covered well in the briefs second whethe r one sees ambiguity does not really depend on staring at the language bu t on understanding what transmission in interstate commerce necessarily c overs in the present age in other words the way to win the chevron point is to win the points in the previous paragraph hence i ought to prepare to get the word unambiguous in there somewhere in the middle of a sentenc e and defend it if necessary but not do more does this seem righttwo zero i think its worth giving a little more attention since this is the key iss ue below and ultimately the issue on which the court must rest its decisi on we dont want to lose the trees for the forest that said since wev e dealt with it at length in the briefs i dont know that we need much mor e than a reminder of the issue and the arguments ferc asserts that sectio n two zero one b does not unambiguously determine whether transmission bundled with retail sale is a transmission or a sale of electric energy at wholesale it concluded that such transmission is a sale the dc circuit erroneou sly held that fercs interpretation was permissible but transmission does nt stop being transmission merely because it is sold together with generat ion it is both transmission and a necessary component query whether com ponent is the best word to use of a retail sale therefore under the cl ear language of section two zero one b jurisdiction over all transmissions includ ing transmissions bundled with retail sales is vested in ferc two zero on the related point of nys position that the wholesaleretail bright line applies to transmission in particular light of nys interpretive gymnast ics in its reply re two zero one a at psix isnt a good oneliner simply that i f congress intended to limit fercs transmission jurisdiction to transmissi ons for wholesale then s two zero one b would read the provisions of this subcha pter shall apply to the sale of electric energy at wholesale and all associ ated transmissions or something to that effect two zero note this issue opens the door to discussion of among other things whet her the exclusive purpose of section two zero one b was to fill the attleboro gap and questions about the structure of the fpa eg the relationship betwee n two zero one b and two one one two one two two zero six d etc two zero four what do i do in argument with lpl i find the nga parallel very comp elling and if the court decides to go with us it will have no problem citi ng and following that case on the other hand the argument does not seem to have persuaded anybody but our team not cadc for example on balance i am inclined to say the court has already decided this issue under the p arallel provision of the nga and use some time to press that point one r eason for doing so is that in general it will be much easier for the court just to affirm ferc and cadc than to push thru the complexities and agree w ith us but lpl gives them both a precedent for overruling ferc on its own jurisdiction and a comparatively easy way thru the casetwo zero agreed two zero two zero five i need to understand why fercs powers and plans to create regional tra nsmission organizations do not fully solve the problem i need to get a de tailed understanding of the facts and a onesentence answer to why there i s still a problem two zero the primary answer in our reply is that order two zero zero zero does not require rtos i t only encourages their voluntarily formation and that theres no indicati on that monopolists will give up their market power unless compelled p one nine two zero six most important what other points in addition to two and four does anyone think i need to be sure to make even more important what points made by ny sg eei california are most likely to trouble the court and provoke q uestions which of them should i plan to answer even if i get no question we might also need to address whether our position runs against six zero years of history didnt the states regulate all aspects of bundled retail sales u ntil order eight eight eight does our position mean that ferc historically abdicated it s responsibility and the states were regulating without authority what is the effect of section two zero one a if not to allow states to continue to regulat e the matters that they regulated in one nine three five this may be an issue to broach only if the court indicates interest though since i think its the toughe st one for us to answer two zero we might also reconsider our position that unbundling is merely an accounti ng issue it seems to me that reversing the position we took in our initia l brief will basically hedge our bets it makes our affirmative argument a little harder since we cant simply say that its crazy to base fercs ju risdiction on an accounting technique but it also makes nys argument har der since they cant simply say that but for a change in the accounting fo r electric service the states would still be regulating interstate transmis sions for retail sale this would also dovetail with some of the other bri efs that made a strong argument that unbundling is a major change in electr ic service necessary to support competition among generators and something over which the states have never exercised jurisdiction two zero thanks to all for thinking about this,14:42:32,"Yes

competition we are definitely not in the business of providing proprietary research to the members but rather working on more generic areas that later individual members could see way to convert to proprietary tools the work that shijie deng and rajnish kamat have been doing with me are good examples as to my trip thanks for the invitation but i already committed myself to get back friday night

through a transition period having doubled the number of universities and industry members within the last year consequently our business processes are not well developed one of the problems we are facing is the balance between the electrical engineering folks and industry members that are more interested in market related research i hope to recruit more of the later so tat we have more of a constituency in the advisory board that sees the value of market related research i already have a verbal commitment from people at electrabell that expressed interest in joining pserc with members

list of issues on november two two and reply comments on december one staff will draft and submit a preliminary order to the commissioners for their discussion on december one three there will be a prehearing on december one five when parties will be asked to brief the commission on list of issues by the end of first week in january there will be a hearing on january one six followed with another hearing if needed parties have asked the commission to finalize its decision by mid march to give you some more background i have to mention that almost most of your suggestions were accepted and will be reflected in the final protocols except for problems with intrazonal gaming regarding congestion management and payasbid compensation for selected ancillary services a few additional concerns are raised regarding ancillary services and congestion management stakeholders are still working toward more load participation in ercot market however the main problem is the fact that market pilot that covers one zero zero of wholesale but only five of retail load will be open on june one two zero zero one based on a version of the protocols locked on august one two zero zero zero that was the deadline for ercot to give a final design to anderson consulting that version does not include some of your recommendations to address market design flaws the full version is highly possible to be implemented by january one two zero zero two when market for one zero zero retail competition is scheduled to open given this gap some parties have recommended not to implement

texas for approval of the ercot protocols discussion and possible action parviz adib jess totten keith rogas and tammy cooper chairman wood turned to page two item number three of the draft order identifying issues recommending that the word including be changed to other than in the parentheses he thinks they know the ups and downs of the two mechanisms which are bid caps and price caps but would not mind having parties focus on what other protections might be used commissioner walsh would say including but not limited to because she does not think it is a bad idea for ercot to at least consider in their protocols a failsafe mechanism its kind of like the stock market suspending trading when something crazy happens they could consider a maximum scenario such as we dont think this will ever happen but if it does we need to muffle it whether it is one zero zero zero or nine nine or whatever it is they could consider whether to put into the protocols a selfenacting price cap while not expecting it to happen if it did you dont have to declare it an emergency and have the commission have to act chairman wood asked if they could leave the question without the parenthetical at all and just say what protections should be added to avoid extreme price spikes commissioner walsh reiterated that she wants ercot to think about the unlikely possibility of unacceptable price spikes she would like for them to have their own failsafe mechanism that is selfinitiating as opposed to leaving that to having someone have to come in and act commissioner perlman stated that he thinks the californiatype price caps is what the concern is about he thinks everyone in this state is opposed to those but he thinks the point commissioner walsh is making is an interesting one he had not thought about the circuit breaker idea and it might have some merit he agreed that it was worth considering something like that then the question becomes what the level is chairman wood suggested the wording what selfimplementing protections should be added to avoid the price spikes commissioner perlman said he did not think anyone is talking about two five zero price caps commissioner walsh agreed but noted that if the unexpected happens we should be prepared commissioner perlman indicated that if someone is making one zero zero zero zero in one particular hour that it probably does not b enefit the market and is probably a windfall to them it is not something they would normally put in their business plan for determining whether they are going to build a plant in texas chairman wood stated that they want to lean toward the market as heavily as they can on these issues chairman wood noted that some of these issues date back to when dr oren was assisting the commission and asked if he could be brought back again staffer dr parviz adib said that staff had already talked to dr oren and that he is available to assist the commission further chairman wood noted that dr oren had helped people think outside the box without just focusing on california the final wording was clarified to state selfimplementing mechanisms and to delete the parenthetical part of the sentence in question the order was approved as amended,06:42:00,No,

indian unit dabhol power co is mulling a preliminary move toward terminating its project in the state of maharashtra in light of its inability to collect payment for power already delivered a member of the companys board said monday enron however plans to complete phase ii of the two one eight four megawatt power plant said don sturmer a vice president at bechtel enterprises xbtl and member of the board at dabhol power in which bechtel owns a one zero stake the company at its board meeting wednesday in london will consider whats called a preliminary termination notice the first of three steps that end in abandonment of the project sturmer said step two would be an official termination notice and step three would be a notice that the company was surrendering control of the project said sturmer who called the first step procedural were nowhere near steps two and three yet he said whether we go forward with a preliminary termination notice will probably be decided at the board meeting on wednesday issuing the preliminary termination notice could put dabhol power in a position to suspend deliveries as it negotiates its payment disputes with the maharashtra state electricity board or mseb sturmer said as reported the electricity board intends to challenge those bills at the meeting wednesday a spokesman for enron corp which with a six five stake in dabhol power is the projects largest shareholder wouldnt comment on topics for discussion at the upcoming meeting other shareholders include general electric co ge which owns one zero and the mseb which owns one five dabhol power is moving ahead to finish the second phase of the project which is nine five complete sturmer said phase two will add two nominally rated seven five zero megawatt units to the existing seven five zero megawatt unit and add a liquefied natural gas terminal and regasification unit to allow the plant to shift from running on naphtha to running on gas the current plan is to continue constructionand having the entire facility commercially available by the end of this year he said disputes over payments for power delivered to mesb the controversial three billion project indias largest foreign investment has been mired in financial disputes since the electricity board began missing payments last year according to sturmer the board owes dabhol power four eight million for power delivered in december and january the board made a two four million payment for february but has a three one million bill for march coming due wednesday dabhol power officials met monday with lenders to update them on the dispute and to discuss steps the company might take in light of the missed payments dabhol power officials werent available tuesday to comment on the outstanding payments according to some news reports dabhol power was seeking to secure its lenders approval for a plan to terminate the project a dabhol power executive and a banker both involved in the talks wouldnt confirm or deny the reports john ambler spokesman for enrons global assets group called the meeting a regular status update the lenders hadnt formulated a response by late monday the banker said the talks were to continue tuesday according to indian news reports enron may seek approval at the meeting from dabhol shareholders to sell some or all of its stake in the project ambler wouldnt confirm or deny those reports but pointed to previous comments from enrons chief executive that any asset is for sale if the price is right enron had sought to reduce its shareholding to the five zero originally envisioned before the electricity board proved unable to cover its entire share of the projects second phase but sturmer said dabhols current difficulties would have to be resolved before any stakes could be sold i do not think any of the owners is actively pursuing a buyer he said dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power critics object to the companys charging seven one rupees one inrfour six eight four a kilowatthour for its power compared with around inrone five kwh charged by other suppliers sturmer said the high cost is the result of the electricity boards failure to buy enough electricity to spread out fixed capacity charges the rates presume the board would dispatch nine zero of the units capacity instead the board facing financial difficulty sharply reduced its calls on the plant in early two zero zero zero sometimes idling it entirely sturmer said as reported by the press trust of india monday the maharashtra state government will form a highlevel committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with dabhol power we have decided that the government of maharashtra will constitute a negotiating committee to

from the state government and mseb speaking to reporters sinha said we hope dpc will respond positively to this and not take steps that will precipitate a crisis although this appears like the beginning of a breakthrough as far as the government of maharashtras stand on the enron controversy is concerned it is left to see as to how it is accepted or reciprocated by enron sources said since enron had already slapped two arbitration notices on the state government and a arbitrationconciliatory notice on the centre the legal aspects of the issue will also have to be resolved this will however be seen by the legal experts and a view would have to be taken as to how this could be dealt with if negotiations on the ppa were to begin all over again the lenders to the project are meeting

two four two zero zero one the globe and mail metro afour all material copyright c bell globemedia publishing inc and its licensors all rights reserved the ontario government is hoping that a competitive electricity market will be ready by may two zero zero two but has stopped short of fixing a day for deregulation to begin the declaration made separately by premier mike harris and energy minister jim wilson yesterday shows that there is still uncertainty in the government over timing the beginning of competition in the provinces one zero billion electricity market that indecision angered some industry officials who had wanted the province to set a date deregulation has been under discussion for more than three years but is highly controversial because of problems that energy deregulation has caused in alberta and california mr harris speaking in hamilton said the timing depends in part on when the provinces shuttered pickering a nuclear station returns to service adding muchneeded juice to the provinces supplies you dont have to be a rocket scientist to understand that we are looking at some time january february for the return of pickering onto the grid we believe thats an important supply factor that needs to be there he said he also warned that ratepayers should brace for an increase in the price of electricity because of the growing tightness in the north american power market despite the possibility of higher rates mr harris argued that competition is the proper course because price increases would be steeper if ontario retained a monopoly over the generation and the sale of electricity clearly the track we are on is higher energy prices mr harris told reporters thats global thats certainly northamericawide and that is the case here in the province of ontario in electricity and in other energy sources in a related legislative statement yesterday mr wilson referred to the may two zero zero two date as the time when the government is confident that conditions necessary to open the electricity market to competition will exist when asked later whether may two zero zero two was an absolutely fixed date for deregulation mr wilson replied yes the association of major power consumers in ontario a lobby group for big electricity users had a hostile response to mr wilsons formal statement its president arthur dickinson said he was appalled by the weak language the association wants a large number of electricity producers to open up shop in ontario to increase the chances that competition will lead to lower prices for big power users but is worried that companies wont build generating stations until they are sure the government has a firm opening date hes left uncertainty in the air and thats not helpful we have potential investors who want to get into this market who i dont think are going to invest if the minister uses words like hes confident the market will open by may two zero zero two they need a definitive date mr dickinson said companies have announced plans to spend about three billion on two seven new or expanded generation stations in ontario the ministry of energy says but very few of those projects are actually under construction recently the head of enron corp a major us power producer said it would reevaluate plans for a two zero zero million power plant in ontario if the government didnt fix a date for the market to open adding to the upward pressure on electricity prices in ontario is the governments decision to pay off the almost two zero billion in debt incurred to build the existing generating and distribution system the government wants to pay off this two zero billion known as the socalled stranded debt by two zero one seven with charges on purchases of electricity mr harris said delaying repayment is not being considered certainly the debt has to be repaid it is being repaid now starting june one the current increase in prices of eight per cent a significant portion of that is to make sure hydro ontario power generation is generating the kind of revenue it needs to pay down that debt he said ontario power is the provincially owned electricity utility one of the

source world reporter tm fuel cells spark analysts interest investment fuelcell energy inc danbury conn develops and commercializes fuel cell power plants for electric power generation analyst kent a mortensen vice president and senior research analyst at robert w baird co mortensen thinks fuelcells strong partnership with enron corp and good management team will help it take advantage of the pressing need for reliable power the fallout from utility deregulation and the pressure on power generators to protect the environment enron thinks theres about a one billion market for alternative energy products and the economies of fuelcells product appear to make more sense than other technologies like solar and wind power he said most people confuse fuel cells which have been around since the one eight zero zero s and were used in the apollo space missions with batteries but while batteries store energy for later use fuel cells use natural gas to start a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen that makes electricity nickel is the catalyst its a chemical reaction not combustion mortensen said fuelcells products look like big round cans and can get as hot as one two zero zero degrees their biggest downside is cost their generating capacity costs about five zero zero zero a kilowatt a number mortensen thinks needs to shrink to about one two zero zero but hes betting that fuelcell which is hoping to have commercial units of the product its testing available by the end of this year will be able to lower its prices if it can sign on enough customers they believe they have a road map to bring costs down to a reasonable basis mortensen said that effort would be helped greatly if fuelcell wins the contract its trying to get with enron to build a two six megawatt fuel cell farm in connecticut mortensen sees several trends working in fuelcells favor new technologies have created a huge need for reliable power yet just when we need power quality to improve to support the internet telecommunications and ecommerce its actually degrading mortensen said he believes californias problems with power generation and transmission are just the beginning seventy percent of our nations power grid is more than two five years old and three zero percent of it is more than five zero years old mortensen said were moving to a two one stcentury digital economy with a two zero thcentury grid that was built to support the air conditioner and tv he said utility deregulation has encouraged power suppliers to underinvest resulting in a shortage of power plants and transmission lines it is difficult to build new power plants because of environmental regulations and peoples aversion to living or working near them these factors will drive demand for new power technologies mortensen predicted fuelcells products have minimal emissions and are perfect for generating power onsite for say a small factory fuelcells product a molten carbonate fuel cell can take up the size of roughly a tennis court and provide power that has for all practical purposes no emissions mortensen said he believes those attributes can help fuelcell take market share away from centralized power plants much as the personal computer has taken share away from mainframes the company doesnt make money now but mortensen expects fuelcell to turn profitable in two zero zero four its partner enron has incentive to make that happen because if it sells five five megawatts of fuelcells product by september two zero zero two it gets warrants for about eight percent of the company mortensen thinks the biggest risk associated with this stock is the possibility that fuelcell which has never made its products in scale wont be able to bring down its costs if they dont get the right level of orders they wont be able to drive the cost down he said the other big risk is that fuelcells patented technology could fail im more worried about them getting the cost down their technology seems reasonably sound but you still have to convince people to have their power supplied by a new technology and a lot of people dont like to take chances with new technology he said mortensen thinks this stock is best for investors who are willing to own it as part of a basket of power technology companies betting on whos going to be the winner in this space is difficult this is a very speculative investment he said mortensen would buy fuelcell shares up to seven zero in the near term and thinks they could go as high as one two zero in the next one two to two four months kathleen

functionality tonight which will be available for use on monday morning two information sessions will be held in houston to further explain the new functionality it is very important to attend these sessions to fully understand the new features for sessions in calgary or portland please contact savita puthigai at seven one three eight five three one seven eight seven for sessions in london oslo singapore australia or tokyo please contact pcg london on four four two zero seven seven eight three seven seven eight three date time location tuesday two seven th february three three zero to four zero zero eb two seven ctwo wednesday two eight th february three three zero to four zero zero eb two seven ctwo there are two areas of new functionality spreads and stack manager spreads from monday enron traders will be able to define a spread product on enrononline in which the customer can trade on a single spread product and receive a transaction for each leg of the underlying products for example a customer could select to buy the april vs may spread product a successful transaction would result in a sell for the april product and a purchase for the may product both of these underlying transactions will show up in the customers transaction list the spread itself will not show up only the two legs the price for leg one will be equal to the average of the bid and offer or the bid or offer alone if the averge cannot be computed because either side is missing for the leg one product the price for leg two will be equal to the price for legone plus the spread price to ensure accuracy and consistency enrononline product control will set up these new products initially stack manager there are a few changes to stack manager which may or may not be directly associated with spreads new stack link type on the link dropdown box on the product properties page there is a new stack link type called stack basis link if you select this link then the price you enter into the stack depth window will be added to the price in the stack depth window from the parent it will not be added to the calculated price of the parent which appears on the website for example product one is a stand alone product with bid at five zero zero product two is a basis link child with stack depth price at zero two five so the calculated total price which appears on the website is five two five product three is a stack basis link with stack depth price at zero zero five so the calculated total price which appears on the website is zero three zero autohedge changes if an enron trader has an autohedge set up between two products which they are managing under the same book then the parent product will respond as though an autohedge transaction has occurred but no transaction will actually be entered into the system this is intended to simplify position management where you want the parent price to respond to a transaction on the child but do not want to manually remove transactions within the same book note that autohedge functionality remains the same as it was before this update for autohedge transactions between products which are not in the same book trade linked view you can now view linked transactions together on the transaction display section in the stack manager to do so right click in the transaction display section and select linked view you will see a single transaction with a plus sign for any linked deals eg spreads and autohedged deals to see the individual transactions that make up the linked transaction click on the plus sign you can display the linked transactions in a expanded or collapsed view to do so right click in the transaction display area and select full expand or full collapse to return to the default transaction display right click in the transaction display area and select transaction view new enrononline contact as part of a restructuring within enrononline savita puthigai will be your primary contact within enrononline for trading and system design issues future emails such as this one will be sent from her address she can be contacted in houston on three one seven eight seven dave,08:58:00,"Yes

four is price gouging root of crisis orange county register editorial may two one two zero zero one the president is allowing the pricegouging energy companies many of whom reside in texas to get away with murder gov gray davis said on thursday in response to a george w bush energy plan that doesnt call for caps on the price of electricity sold by outofstate generators to california this remark captured the essence of the davis approach to the energy problems blame everybody else call for government price controls even though they historically have reduced the supply of energy and use divisive and even conspiratorial rhetoric on the same day governor davis was blasting the bush energy plan his appointee who runs the public utilities commission loretta lynch told a newspaper that power generators purposefully keep their plants idle to jack up prices attorney general bill lockyer said that he found evidence of what ms lynch called artificial shortages were interested in seeing the evidence of course but it looks suspiciously like politicians are using the powergouging theory as a way to bluster rather than come up with concrete solutions it also is a way for those who are ideologically hostile to deregulation perhaps cynical of business and capitalism in general to demonize merchant generators and pave the way for a government takeover no doubt wholesale electricity prices have skyrocketed prices zoomed from two zero zero a megawatt hour late last year to nearly two zero zero zero last week according to the san francisco chronicle the newspaper reports that plant shutdowns are a cause of the price spike yet a number of analysts have found the pricegouging theory to be dubious a dow jones newswire column analyzed federal energy regulatory commission data on the amount of forced outages over the past two summers yes there were nearly four times as many plant closures by plants owned by five big producers in summer two zero zero zero than in summer one nine nine nine but as writer mark golden pointed out outages for all plants including municipally owned ones and small qualifying facilities that have no incentive to game the system were six five eight percent higher in summer two zero zero zero than in summer one nine nine nine the writer notes that four of the big five are either constructing big new generators in california or have applied for permits to do so that would seem to fly in the face of a withholding strategy an april paper coauthored by william hogan a professor at the john f kennedy school of government at harvard university could not prove there wasnt manipulation but explained it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even be significant the bigger issue the hogan paper argued is the seriously flawed restructuring system that caused the electricity market collapse the principal policy focus should be on fashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in the market design that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown other analysts argue that to whatever degree pricegouging has taken place it is solely the fault of the retail price caps and other government rules that have distorted the market the large number of shutdowns has not been the result of any conspiracy the power generators say but the result of needed maintenance on facilities that have been overworked many of these are older plants that require more shutdowns for maintenance than new ones people can invest money in various different markets jan smutnyjones told us he is executive director of the independent energy producers association in sacramento which represents qfs and merchant generators with politically charged hearings demonization of power generators proposals for excessprofits taxes and threats of seizing property made by california democrats he said generators may conclude that california is a dangerous place to invest gov davis said the bush plan wont add any new electrical power but neither will davis grandstanding about pricegougers in fact it may even dissuade electricity investment the governor needs to apply his will it create new power standard to his own rhetoric then get busy leading the state out of this mess,06:21:00,No,

am to rorschach reagan subject re open items for mdea original message from mann kay sent wednesday may two three two zero zero one five zero six pm to rorschach reagan kroll heather fairley david may tom subject open items for mdea fairley david here are issues which im unclear about all of which impact the drafting of the agreement how are we setting the heat rate do we have the gads is it a daily average weekly average flat rate adjusted if so how often fairley david each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate exhibit and the stack model as conditions change the utilities must update this info we are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage services and orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry it can never be exact but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability no gads heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions fairley david yes their units are too small we have discussed this with the customer and with our internal air permit guys rorschach reagan they have title v permits and they are faxing them to us today they have no run hour limitations on gas however they are limited on oil will need to get that summary to kay as soon as possible we have determined that we wont deal with fuel oil right fairley david we wont buy and sell fuel oil we may dispatch on oil at startup or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable which constitutes a product transaction with the resulting profit split rorschach reagan we need to state that mdea and cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies we arent making money on gas right fairley david we make money on gas two ways the first is outside the contract and is basicly any internal profit on resale of gas to the cities the second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a product trade and those procedures apply do we have a defn of costs that we like yet and if so how does it fit in to the picture fairley david yes will send separately is there an uptodate set of exhibits fairley david the marketing strategy the trading and risk policy and the description of asset management have been upated the other exhibits have not been modified the marketing strategy and trading risk policy have been discussed at length with mdea mdea commercial not legal and their commentsquestions incorporated it would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following in words andor formulae the defn and method of establishing the bogey target production cost formula can be an exhibit which would be great for the commercial team to work on fairley david thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties will look at it again conceptually mdea services group and orig are in full agreement so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough rorschach reagan see attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example are we determined how we should deal with imbalances part of cost of power fairley david there are three considerations on this one who wears imbalance exposure two who manages imbalances hourly type activity and three who pays for imbalances imbalances are billed by entergy directly to mdea under their network services agreement epmis hourly desk manages the loadresource items hourly but mdea has the exposure physical and price to imbalances weatherload changes and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances they happen they are uncontrollable and we fix them which epmis hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties a different section in the contract states that mdea wears the exposure how are we setting the bogey formula fairley david the bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the days activities rorschach reagan records of bogey decisions will be archieved subject to audit fairley david yes but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day frankly they would like to have less involvement ie they trust us to do it all but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day two bogeys or one gas and oil fairley david one bogey for power gas is an input for determining the bogey rorschach reagan bogey set dayahead what is defn of profit i think i have the general idea but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check fairley david this is in the pricing calcs should we have a definition what costs are included on the buy and sell side fairley david see cost definition being provided separately re stack model a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used fairley david see definition in my markups to the main agreement updated exhibit on facilities contracted resources operating limits fairley david services and orig are reviewing these but other than what was mentioned above probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem what information does mdea need for us to provide in order to split costsprofits are we clear that cities buy gas mdea buyssells power rorschach reagan i will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily and monthly we need to make sure to limit our info providing responsibilities to those reports it would be great if i could get one set of answers to these questionsissues which has commercial buy in all around thanks kay,04:38:00,No,

pursue the arbitration proceedings whic h have already been initiated by the company according to senior ministry officials under the power purchase agreement ppa conciliation and arbit ration are two methods under the contract to resolve disputes between the t wo parties normally arbitration is resorted to only after conciliation fa ils however in this case dpc has dragged mseb to the arbitration forum e ven as the conciliation process is being pursuedtwo zero dpc has already slapped three arbitration notices on the maharashtra state electricity board mseb the first notice was issued to the board for its failure to honour the december two zero zero zero bill of rs one zero two crore and the january two zero zero one bill of rs one one one six crore while two other notices were for failures to hono ur the maharashtra governments state support agreement and the supplementa ry state support agreement the conciliation process was adopted in the wak e of the dispute arising over the

seven and was to be concluded in two months however simultaneously arbitration proceedings were trigg ered between dpc and mseb with the conciliation process making little head way the finance ministry sought an additional two months time for concludi ng the process prior to that the attorney generals interpretation of the msebdpc contract was that the payment could be made to dpc only if the bi ll was undisputed hence the centre decided to opt for the conciliation pr ocesstwo zero during recent meetings between the government and the dpc officials the la tter had pointed out that if

matter between the mseb and dpcthey saidtwo zero analysts feel that the power minister mr suresh prabhus words of hope to defuse the dabhol crisis are not grounded in reality the centre is totti ng sale of dabhol power to thirdparty as a key solution however first u nder the existing electricity laws the centre cannot authorise thirdparty sale since it is in the states domain secondly since it

minutes is not possible by any such plant in th e world in a way it was msebs defiant posturing coupled with the maharas htra governments passing the buck up that got the central government to ac ttwo zero one thing evident throughout the crisis is that all the players are trying to save their own skin in spite of the developments enron has played its cards close to its chest and hinted to institutions at taking a hit on its returns only a few days ago even that mr wade cline managing director enron india pvt ltd is reported to have told indian lenders would hinge o n substantial give

many of you responded and i want to share the survey results with you additionally i want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move enron forward first lets take a look at the survey results in just three days more than four zero zero zero employees completed the survey i sincerely appreciate your participation i we asked you to identify the top five issues facing enron today the responses were one stock price two the prc three employeeinternal morale four external reputation and image five walking the talk of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ ii we asked you general questions about working at enron comparing two zero zero one to two zero zero zero of employees responding strongly agreeagree i am committed to staying at enron six four one enron is a company i would invest my money in six zero one i am treated with respect six zero zero i would recommend enron as a place to work for friends and family five nine one i have talents and skills that enron is not fully utilizing five four seven enron truly encourages people to take risks four seven five my immediate supervisor has a clear view of where enron is going and how to get there four six six executive management has a clear view of where enron is going and how to get there four one six _________________________________________________________________________________________ iii we asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to enron comparing two zero zero one to two zero zero zero more same less na concerned for communities three four five four four nine one zero three one zero three innovative three zero eight three five seven two four six eight nine entrepreneurial two eight five three seven eight two three seven one zero zero ethical one seven zero four five one two eight one nine eight trustworthy one four nine three nine zero three six nine nine two arrogant three nine one three two four one three three one five two selfserving four one nine three eight six seven five one two zero _________________________________________________________________________________________ iv finally we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at enron one people the high quality of people at enron was the most widelycited aspect talented creative learn from one another two culture and reputation innovative spirit willingness to be aggressive and take risks ability to embrace change involvement in community three work environment pay and benefits true meritocracy unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ the results of our survey confirmed for the management committee and me the great things you feel about enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move enron forward the following are some of the things were doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback now heres what were going to do based on your feedback stock price we are all concerned about our stock price which has declined significantly this year the primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include a decline in the overall market and economy certain enronspecific issues such as california india and recent management turnover a meltdown in the broadband sector which may have been as much as three zero four zero of our stock price at the high lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winters high and concerns over the pace of energy deregulation these concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution wholesale and retail businesses very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth and future earnings growth as has enron we fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve over the past month we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses we have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money we also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward mark koenig executive vice president of investor relations will host brown bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions he will also continue to host espeak sessions to answer employee questions greg whalley mark frevert and i will also hold discussions with various groups of employees which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide watch for these events the prc the relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives nevertheless we recognize that certain aspects of the prc may have caused some of you concern and we believe we can improve refine streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone therefore we will make the following changes to the prc process prior to yearend effective immediately relative performance discussions will occur annually at yearend however business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently the current preferred distribution will no longer be required across enron business units will be asked to identify only their top one zero and bottom one zero performers for review by enrons office of the chairman annually at yearend we will continue to use the pep three six zero degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees we will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year finally we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes in the november issue of enron business we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process in addition there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to yearend employee morale we believe the stock price our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale additionally some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns effective immediately we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their human resources hr rep we are establishing a new business function we are calling employee relations er that will report directly to the office of the chairman cindy olson will head this function more details of how this group and hr will operate will be communicated in the next few days over the long term we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles we will encourage vice presidents and above as well as other current and emerging leaders to complete executive impact influence training these sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people additionally we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via communicate which will be rolled out immediately communicate is an interactive training course that uses enron scenarios and a combination of video voice mails emails and meetings notes to analyze user performance based on a participants responses and actions external reputation we all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year the single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees we recognize that as enrons ambassadors in the marketplace the more you know about our strategy performance and challenges the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company to ensure you are better informed we will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting enron in addition to our existing communication efforts like email messages and internal publications ebiz and enron business we will post a qa on current issues on the enron intranet at homeenroncom httphomeenroncom this will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers as we said before greg mark and i as well as members of our management committee will meet with groups of employees across enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges look for these to start in midoctober integrity respect i believe as i said previously we need to reinforce our core values particularly integrity and respect from what you have told us in this survey you agree enrons values will have more importance in each employees evaluation and feedback we ask that all employees regardless of level hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis we are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers we will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional specific feedback on employee issues like ethics integrity and individual concerns if you would like to participate in these focus groups please send an email to cindy olson periodically i will host a special feature column in enron business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results finally i give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding enrons strategy and challenges and listening to your concerns and ideas but we would ask for your commitment too we need your dedication to enron and its values as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve longterm success we will conduct another employee survey early next year please continue to send me

comed has included a cover letter which indicates a significant level of uncertainty regarding a zero one interconnect at plano under the guidelines of appendix k of comeds open access transmission tarriff we are required to execute this loi within one five days of the date of receipt seven seven zero zero in order to maintain our current position six one two zero zero in the comed queue if we execute after seven two two zero zero then the date our date in the comed queue becomes the date of execution of the loi appendix k provides that once the loi is executed comed shall provide enron with an interconnection study is and project diagram pd within four five days comed has the option to extend another three zero days if needed the is and pd will provide enron with a description of the upgrades required and an estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect the is and pd do not provide enron with information on transmission availability ie atc this would be addressed by the interconnection feasibility study currently in progress by comed i am expecting the results of this ifs in the next two three weeks comed informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current interpretation of appendixk provides that if the commercial start date of a proposed ipp project is delayed that there is no impact to that proposed projects queue position relative to competing projects provided that all interconnection milestones loi pd notice to proceed and ia remain current comed further indicated that such a delay would result in a project with an inferior queue position ie wizvest being charged with the necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line prior to the project with the superior queue position i will request that this interpretation be confirmed by comed in writing to enron this interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the torrence site relative to the wizvest planned zero one interconnect i will review this letter on the plane to houston this afternoon i believe that it authorizes comed to spend up to one zero zero k on engineering related to the interconnect design it also addresses the ordering and payment responsibilities for longlead equipment required to facilitate the proposed interconnection based upon our development budget discussions earlier this week we obviously do not want to incurr longlead equipment charges prior to having a clear value proposition in our sights i will have recommendations ready for you on these issues by wednesday i am

lowest risk is likely in the cheapest stocks and duk may be the best bet over the week or so dyn in the midthree zero s and ene in the midsix zero s are also attractive two duke energy conference call reiterated that about nine zero of california portfolio is hedged forward with nonutilities or in transactions outside of the independent system operator iso or power exchange px we estimate dukes financial exposure is less than zero zero four per share annually discussionthoughts on california and brief comments on the duke energy conference call key representatives of the california utilities power generators marketers have been in meetings in washington dc with the ferc chairman secretary of energy us treasurer and members of the clinton staff we have the following comments on what we believe may be and should be longterm solutions to the california energy crisis what we think will come out of washington meetings one power generators will agree to selling power under longterm up to one zero year contracts at the capped retail rates six five seven five megawatt hour mwh assuming that they can buy gas supply forward however that market is very illiquid and can take weeks to secure a transaction two politicianslegislators want to avoid bankruptcies but we still think there is a five zero five zero probability three utilities likely to be able to buysell electricity in forward market four california is likely to eliminate the power exchange px and replace with negotiated buysell market five forbearance brings up issues of whether the utility can defer payments for power supply for a number of periods or whether the state will pick up the bills the impact on the receivables of the power generatorsmarketers and lenders is uncertain six we believe actual seizure of power plants from the unregulated suppliers by the state is unlikely as is the removal of emissions credits also we understand nox emissions credits can be as high as four six megawatt hour in california seven resignation of reigning ferc commissioner jim hoecker on one one eight zero one allows for bushappointed commissioner to step in most likely to be republican curt hebert herbert has been vehemently opposed to price caps and supports competitive markets eight under a new ferc we think there is a low risk of retroactive repercussions on generators to give back past profits on electricity sold in california last summer and also that a windfall profits tax on generatorsmarketers is unlikely nine companies such as duk dyn and ene all appear to have less than zero zero five per share of annual earnings exposure to california generationmarketing sales net of risk mitigation however recent conversations with reliant energy have revealed that it has not hedged its receivables risk with the utilities in california typical monthly receivable balances range from five two seven zero million or up to zero six zero of earnings exposure rei is betting on the risk of bankruptcy of pge and edison is unlikely and therefore the cost to set of credit reserves at this point would more than outweigh potential earnings exposure one zero while these stocks in addition to rei appear oversold the stock performance is likely to be volatile until a solution to the ca energy crisis is introduced in our view the california market solutions fall short of the big picture i have been cautioning investors to avoid the abovementioned stocks until a more longerterm solution is decided upon however the lowest risk is likely in the cheapest stocks and duk may be the best bet over the week or so still dyn in the midthree zero s and ene in the midsix zero s are also attractive in our view one one we expect dyn duk ene and rei to all report positive four qzero one earnings surprises of at least a penny or so but to the extent that the surprise is related to power generation the stocks may not react favorably what we think will solve the california problem one eliminate all retail rate freezes and let the market forces balance supply and demand higher electricity prices to the consumer will encourage less use and the purchase of more efficient energy equipment and will also encourage independent generators to build new facilities two we agree with the allowance of forward sales and a free spot market for unregulated electricity transactions three a word on the hydroelectric generators most are governmentowned facilities that virtually generate electricity for free it would stand to reason that the hydroelectric generators aka the federal government has been financial benefiting from selling free power into a market that has been marginally priced off of highpriced natural gas shouldnt the government also be asked to share the pain following highlights from duk call one duke controls or owns three three zero zero megawatts of electric generating capacity out of a portfolio of about six zero zero zero megawatts about nine zero of its california portfolio is hedged forward with third parties that are not utilities or in transactions involving the independent system operator or power exchange two dukes receivables at risk are not material financially or operationally according to the company duke pointed out that just over one zero of ebit is generated from its wholesale energy business although we estimate it is closer to one five three duke has a minimal number of contracts with pge and socal ed eix subsidiary four nothing material has been agreed upon in the washington meetings between industry representatives legislators and feds but the likelihood of power plant seizures and retroactive penalties appear unlikely five we estimate duks annual financial exposure net of forward sales is less than zero zero four per share
