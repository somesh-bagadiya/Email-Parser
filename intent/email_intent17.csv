the companies deny any collusion high natural gas prices are just one factor in the states energy crisis a tight electricity supply caused in part by maintenance at california power plants and scarce hydroelectricity in the pacific northwest has contributed to rolling blackouts four times this year including twice statewide this week the hearing comes on the heels of a state audit released thursday that says californias one nine nine six deregulation law encourages market manipulation by electricity buyers and sellers and the california independent system operator which oversees most of the states power grid told the federal energy regulatory commission that electricity suppliers have overcharged it and the state power exchange at least six two billion since may for power the two

southern california edison and pacific gas and electric co could hit two three billion by two zero zero three a legislative source told the ap on condition of anonymity thats far more than lawmakers and gov gray davis estimated when they approved legislation authorizing the states power purchases at the time they projected they would need one zero billion in revenue bonds to buy power for the two utilities over a decade the bonds would be repaid by the utilities customers over several years davis has said repeatedly he is confident the states power crisis can be resolved without further rate hikes but the source said cabinet secretary susan kennedy finance director tim gage and deputy chief of staff john stevens all warned lawmakers that customers rates would have to be raised at least five zero percent to cover the new projections that increase would come on top of a nine percent to one five percent increase the public utilities commission approved in january as well as an additional one zero percent increase already scheduled for next year davis spokesman steve maviglio confirmed that kennedy spoke with top democrats on friday but declined to elaborate the source said the calculations were by the administration not the puc which would have to implement any rate increases lawmakers werent told over what time frame such an increase would need to be implemented the source said consumer advocate harvey rosenfield of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights promised a rebellion at the ballot box in two zero zero two if rates continued to rise if this goes through this is the beginning of the ratepayers revolt he said the puc is expected on tuesday to address how customer rates will be divided between the state and the utilities socal edison and pgampe both have pushed for rate increases and pgampe has said its current rates would be insufficient to cover its bills and the states both say theyve lost more than one three billion since summer due to high wholesale electricity costs that californias one nine nine six deregulation law prevents them from collecting from their customers pgampes and edisons credit was cut off by electricity wholesalers in january and the state has been spending four zero million to five zero million a day since then to keep the lights on for their customers _ about four two billion in taxpayer money so

is for discussion during our wednesday public affairs committee meeting thanks jean march two six two zero zero one memorandum to iep fr ray mcnally richard temple tony russo jean munoz tom ross re initiative campaign strategy outline harvey rosenfield has on numerous occasions threatened to place an initiative on the two zero zero two ballot to reregulate the power industry it is not a hollow threat not only has rosenfield successfully placed initiatives on the ballot in the past but the current energy crisis has become the number one issue on the minds of voters dd making it easier to qualify a ballot measure and our own internal polling for iep shows voters would initially support the concept of reregulating the industry however qualifying an initiative for next years election is not a foregone conclusion and passing one is an even more difficult task rosenfield faces several roadblocks o the current energy issue is complicated and all potential solutions have weaknesses that could be exploited in a political campaign o ieps internal polling shows rosenfields proposal has weaknesses that could be exploited dd including the price tag and the image of a staterun energy department that could be compared to the dmv and caltrans o rosenfield would have a difficult time funding a campaign especially raising the resources to overcome a strong well funded no campaign o the burden of proof always falls on the yes campaign rather than the no campaign voters are concerned about giving their approval to changes that could make things worse rosenfield will have to prove his case beyond a shadow of a doubt and therefore it is easier to defeat an initiative than it is to pass one o if power generators become motivated they can be a formidable opponent following is one a preliminary timeline rosenfield would face in trying to qualify an initiative for the ballot in two zero zero two two strategic concepts that should be considered before pursuing a plan to defeat the initiative three preliminary strategic and tactical options in opposing the initiative and four a discussion of campaign costs we recommend using this outline as a starting point to develop an effective campaign plan that could successfully defeat rosenfield if he pursues an initiative strategy timeline to date no proposed ballot initiative has been submitted to the attorney general for title and summary accordingly there is not sufficient time available to qualify an initiative for the march two zero zero two ballot however there is still adequate time to qualify a measure for the november two zero zero two ballot we believe rosenfield could submit a measure to the attorney general as late as september two zero zero one and still qualify the initiative for the november two zero zero two ballot dd especially if the summer months produce power blackouts skyrocketing energy bills and the image of a bungling governor legislature and regulators the following timeline would allow rosenfield to submit language for title and summary as late as september two eight two zero zero one and qualify the initiative for the november two zero zero two ballot september two eight two zero zero one proposed measure is submitted to the ag for title and summary november two zero two zero zero one attorney general prepares and issues title and summary proponent can begin circulating petitions april one nine two zero zero two the proponent files the petitions with county elections officials may one two zero zero two county elections officials complete petition raw count totals and certify raw numbers to the secretary of state june two three two zero zero two county elections officials verify and certify results of the number of valid signatures in their counties and turn in counts to the secretary of state june two seven two zero zero two secretary of state determines if the initiative qualifies for the ballot proponent needs six seven zero eight one six valid signatures to qualify a constitutional amendment or four one nine two six zero valid signatures to qualify a straight statute strategic concepts there are several strategic concepts that should be reviewed o while satisfying rosenfield may be impossible iep could push hard to ensure a solution is passed by the legislature to give credibility to the criticism that rosenfield is an extremist whose initiative could undercut the legislative remedy o the industry could organize a wellfunded campaign that contains an early advertising blitz to quickly define the ballot measure in the most negative manner possible and that delivers a knock out punch in october o generators could promote a counterinitiative proposal either through the legislature or qualified by petition dd stopping rosenfields proposal if more yes votes are received for the counter initiative than the rosenfield measure o paid signature gathering firms could be put on contract for industryrelated business dd thus keeping these firms off the table for rosenfield another variation would be to hire firms to gather signatures calling for legislative action dd thus gaining names of voters who support our position but also keeping signature gatherers too busy to help rosenfileld o the industry could pay to gather signatures on petitions that removes names of people who may have signed the petition for rosenfields initiative this could cut down the number of valid signatures accepted by county election officials o a paid advertising campaign could be run during the proposals signature gathering phase urging voters not to sign the petitions an added benefit of the concept is defining the proposal early if it still qualifies for the ballot o we could organize a legal assault on the proposal dd stopping their signature gathering efforts or keeping it off the ballot campaign strategy if the proposal qualifies for the ballot the industry must pursue an aggressive strategy to defeat the measure we need to identify weaknesses in the proposal and share those weaknesses with voters we must also push voters to question the motives behind the initiative we need to make sure voters are uncomfortable with all or portions of the initiative to ensure they vote no despite wanting adequate and affordable energy the campaign should conduct thorough research to determine the best strategy to defeat the measure initially we believe the no campaign should focus on testing and developing the following messages o the measure will hurt taxpayers a four zero billion price tag is too much for voters to accept as the only solution to the problem o the proposal will hurt public services the cost of rosenfields measure will keep money away from more important programs dd like schools public safety and programs for children and seniors o the ballot measure is simply a way for elected officials to get more tax dollars to cover up their failures dd and they should not be rewarded with public support o rosenfields proposal will result in higher taxes to pay for more bureaucracy and wasted tax dollars o the proposal will result in more inefficient government that will produce unreliable power dd hurting consumers and vital services such as hospitals and public safety o the measure will hurt the economy and cost jobs at a time when the economy is hurting campaign tactics the campaign should follow an aggressive battleplan that includes the following components research focus groups and quantitative surveys should be conducted to help craft the best messages to attack the proposal this research would also be important in efforts to secure the most favorable ballot title and summary possible to our goal of defeating it demographic and election research should also be conducted to determine voters most open to our campaign messages we should also conduct thorough research on rosenfield to expose his true motivations for proposing this measure and its inherent weaknesses legal title summary and ballot argument challenges we should pursue every possible legal option to either get the proposal off the ballot or ensure the most favorable title summary and weakened ballot arguments for the initiative sponsors our experience shows that the ballot title and summary can swing initial vote margins either way by as much as one zero points paid advertising statewide campaigns in california require paid advertising dd including electronic media direct mail and telemarketing advertising should be carefully targeted to ensure the most bang for the buck earned media editorial support is an important part of successful statewide campaigns as is ensuring favorable media coverage of the campaign a focused earned media campaign would greatly enhance the chances for success and editorial support and opeds can provide important third party credibility to the no campaign coalition building it will be critical for the industry to gain credible allies in its fight against rosenfield we do not want the campaign to be portrayed as generators versus consumer groups therefore we need credible third party groups standing along side us to broaden our appeal and message like taxpayer groups business leaders consumer organizations energy experts economists educators law enforcement and seniors campaign costs how much will be needed to defeat rosenfield will depend on several factors depending on several variables the cost of a no campaign can range from a few million dollars to as much as the four zero million spent to defeat proposition nine campaign costs to defeat ballot measures are contingent upon several variables o the popularity of the measure with voters the more they like it on the natural the more expensive it will be to defeat the measure o how much money rosenfield can raise to promote the measure if he has few resources the no campaign will have an uncontested paid advertising campaign which will make defeating the proposal much easier o how bad the energy crisis impacts voters if the next one five months produce an ongoing crisis campaign costs will rise o the effectiveness of messages against the proposal if focus group and survey research confirm the proposal has an achilles heel the cost to defeat the measure will go down dramatically thorough research of rosenfields actual proposal will better enable us to recommend a campaign plan message and budget in summary defeating the rosenfield initiative will cost from a few to several million dollars and a united industry effort,03:06:00,No

2001-10-29,"[""'smarra@isda.org'""]",,"ISDA PRESS REPORT - OCTOBER 29, 2001",isda press report october two nine two zero zero one credit derivatives pricing synthetic cdos derivatives week regulatory cftc makes amendments to cfma two zero zero zero risk news trading practice banks tout economic derivatives ifr pricing synthetic cdos derivatives week october two nine two zero zero one traditionally collateralized debt obligations cdos involve a transfer of collateral assets the cdo liabilities then reference the cash flows principal and interest of the collateral assets but cdos are increasingly issued in synthetic form where there is no physical transfer of collateral in these structures the cdo references default losses rather than the cash flows of the referenced collateral credit default swaps in their simplest form synthetic cdos are akin to single name credit default swaps a credit default swap is a contract where one party the protection buyer makes periodic payments in exchange for payments contingent on a credit event in a single name credit default swap the credit event is the default of a single issuer thus the price of the credit default swaps reflects the markets view of the default likelihood of the reference name in unfunded form a synthetic cdo is essentially a basket default swap in this case in return for a premium the protection seller makes contingent payments based on the default losses incurred by a portfolio or basket of assets the protection may be for first loss or equity in which case the seller pays for the initial default losses up to some threshold second loss or mezzanine where the seller pays losses beyond the first loss threshold up to some higher limit or senior where the seller pays all losses beyond a threshold synthetic cdos may also be structured in funded form the simplest form of this structure is a combination of a risk free bond and a basket default swap the initial investment is used to purchase the risk free bond and at the outset the investor receives the risk free rate of interest from the bond as well as premium payments from the basket default swap as losses occur on the reference portfolio the principal of the bond is reduced to pay the required contingent payments at the maturity of the structure the investor receives the remaining principal of the risk free position in both funded and unfunded forms the pricing of synthetic cdos is primarily a matter of pricing the basket default swaps themselves correlation products it is often said that synthetic cdos are correlation products because their value depends not only on the probability of default for each individual name in the reference portfolio but also on the correlation between those names consider a simple case where the reference portfolio consists of two names each with a five probability of default assume two levels of protection one paying on the first default and one paying on the second if the names are independent then the probability that the first loss protection is triggered is one zero nine five two nine seven five that is one zero zero less the chance that there are zero defaults the probability that the second loss protection is triggered is zero zero five two zero two five that is only if there are two defaults on the other hand if the defaults are perfectly correlated then there are only two possibilities either both or neither of the names default thus the probability that either protection is triggered is the probability that both names default or five note that for the first loss protection the increased correlation has reduced the likelihood that the protection is invoked and therefore reduced the fair price of this protection for the second loss piece the increased correlation has increased the trigger likelihood and fair price the relationship between correlation and pricing holds generally for the first loss and most senior levels of protection in basket default swaps for the first loss piece since losses are capped the pricing is driven primarily by the likelihood that no losses occur which increases with correlation for the senior piece the pricing is driven by the likelihood that an extreme loss occurs which is greater in cases of higher correlation pricing based on the discussion above most pricing models require individual default probabilities and a correlation across the names in the pool since individual default probabilities can often be obtained from single name creditdefault swaps correlation is the main pricing parameter for synthetic cdos consider an example structure with usdthree six million of collateral where first loss protects against the first usdfive million of losses second loss protects against the next usdone zero million of losses and the remaining losses are protected by the senior tranche we can model spreads on each of these tranches at different correlation levels for example using a correlation of four five we obtain model spreads of two basis points two five zero bps and one six four two bps for the senior second loss and first loss protection respectively we can repeat this exercise at different correlation levels to obtain the sensitivity of spreads to changes in correlation figure one shows the normalized cost of protection for each tranche at different correlation levels we can see that the cost of protection for the senior tranche increases with increasing correlation that is the cost increases as senior debt gets riskier while the first loss protection cost decreases with increasing correlation that is the cost decreases as equity gets less risky note that in this particular example the cost of second loss protection behaves like senior as an increasing function of correlation implied correlation we can back out an implied correlation for each tranche from cdo prices in the same way we would obtain implied volatility from option prices and the blackscholes pricing model an implied correlation extracted in this fashion depends on the specific cdo pricing model but the observations above hold generally suppose the market spreads for our example structure are two bps one five zero bps and two zero zero zero bps for the senior second loss and first loss protection respectively we can compare these observed spreads with our model spreads to calibrate a correlation parameter for each tranche for example the model spread is equal to the observed spread for the senior tranche two bps when we price it using a four five correlation in other words the implied correlation for the senior tranche is four five the implied correlation for each tranche can be inferred from figure one as the correlation level with which our pricing model recovers the observed market spread we can see that for the first and second loss tranches the implied correlation is roughly two zero while for the senior tranche the implied correlation is four five a first application of the implied correlation is to mark to market a synthetic tranche on an ongoing basis as we observe changes in the spreads for the individual names in the pool we can reprice the tranches above by assuming the correlation level is constant but updating the spreads additionally implied correlations can be used for relative value analysis for example senior and second loss tranche protection increase in value as correlation increases since both tranches depend on the same basket of names we would expect them to have a similar implied correlation as mentioned above the implied correlation of the senior tranche four five is significantly higher than that of the second loss tranche two zero this means that senior protection is expensive relative to second loss protection we can also perform relative value analysis across deals if we believe that the pools in two different cdos have similar characteristics in terms of credit quality industry and geographical distribution for example if two cdos have similar pools and structure we would expect to observe comparable implied correlations for their senior tranches all else being equal a discrepancy in implied correlation can serve as an indicator of a discrepancy in price between the two structures cftc makes amendments to cfma two zero zero zero risk news october two nine two zero zero one by naomi humphries the commodity futures trading commission cftc has released the final rules relating to the trading of equity futures products in the united states these rules implement provisions of the commodity futures modernisation act of two zero zero zero cfma that lift the one nine year ban on the trading of singlestock and narrowbased stock index futures in the us the final rules are in line with the new cfma statutory provisions regarding the specification of listing standards and conditions for trading security futures products the rules also establish requirements related to the selfcertification of rules and rule amendments reporting of data speculative position limits and special provisions regarding the contract design for the cash settlement and physical delivery of security futures products the cftc received comment from the chicago mercantile exchange cme the chicago board options exchange cboe the american stock exchange amex and the intermarket surveillance group isg the cftc adopted several revisions consistent with comments but stated generally the commentators supported the proposed rules the cftc also streamlined the trading process in its revisions of rules governing commodity futures and options intermediaries on october one nine following the enactment of the cfma and the resulting revisions to the commodity exchange act cea key rules governing intermediaries including futures commission merchants introducing brokers commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisers have been revised to provide greater flexibility consistent with the mandate of the cfma to streamline and eliminate unnecessary regulation for entities registered under the act they include a provision for retail customers to have broad access to registered derivatives transaction execution facilities by permitting them to trade through a commodity trading adviser with two five million or more in assets under management and a proposal to replace the current prescriptive rule over ethics with a statement of acceptable practices the cftc claimed that comments from fimat a registered futures commission merchant and securities brokerdealer exchange analytics an ethics training provider the cbot the national futures association and the managed funds association all generally supported the adoption of the proposed amendments for commodity futures and options intermediaries it added that the issue that generated the most discussion was ethics training acting chairman at the cftc james newsome said these rules are just the first step in the commissions review of appropriate regulatory relief for intermediaries we have begun the intermediary study that congress directed us to perform and we may well be implementing additional regulatory reforms prior to the studys conclusion banks tout economic derivatives ifr october two nine two zero zero one deutsche bank and jp morgan will be using an auction mechanism to deliver the new derivatives products which they say will be selfclearing and selfhedging the solution licensed to the two banks to create derivatives on economic statistics will also be applicable to corporate earnings and revenues mortgage prepayments equity prices central bank target rates indexrelated products electric power weather degree days credit or any eventdriven market where the development of risk management tools has been constrained by illiquidity according to the developer of the solution new yorkbased longitude once the mechanisms are up and running and validated we could envision structured notes on swaps linked to the auction process itself said jp morgan chases chris harvey managing director of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives sales for the americas deutsche bank has picked germanys lfo and japans tankan as the debut products for its economic derivatives franchises in europe and japan jp morgan chase is still in the process of selecting its inaugural us economic statistics product jp morgan and deutsche bank declined to disclose the cost of their franchise on the economic derivatives to retain their exclusive agreements with longitude for the parimutuel digital call auction pdcaenabled derivatives the banks must meet performance benchmarks longitude charges a fee based on the notional volume cleared through its system using longitudes pdca bookrunner product deutsche bank for example would engage in premarketing or preselling activity that is similar to that in a bond or equity syndicate offering followed by a short auction period during the auction period the bank would submit orders to buy or sell digital options on the economic data covered to longitudes webbased system upon receipt of the orders longitudes system produces bidoffer prices for the derivatives being offered and other relevant market equilibrium statistics such as limit order books longitude routes this information back to the bank which publishes the statistics for its customers in this example deutsche bank would be counterparty to transactions that are filled an order that is filled would result in an international swaps and derivatives associationdocumented transaction the filled orders should hedge themselves because in a parimutuel system all claims that end inthemoney are funded by those outofthemoney longitudes clients can offer derivatives without assuming additional risks on their own balance sheets said andrew lawrence chief executive of longitude as the systern accepts orders with limit prices capital markets participants can have a high level of price certainty in a parimutuel system prices are marketdriven and determined by customer participation rather than a model or subjective assessment of the price of risk doubfers a parimutuel model is a demand and supply based market so the question becomes will there be enough participants said richard sandor chief executive of environmental financial products and one of the architects of the interest rate futures markets is it view taking or traditional hedging im not sure said one bulge bracket firms head of market risk management numbers of participants are difficult to predict because they will depend upon the design of the specific auction said longitudes lawrence perhaps as few as one zero one five total orders can form a very rich auction equilibrium he said the cost of operating the call auction is another consideration a high transaction charge will mean less money for the winners it varies from market to market but because banks are not taking market risk the price for the service will be modest said lawrence in general it has always been considered extremely desirable to disaggregate risk factors to the fullest extent possible because they can always be easily recombined lets assume a health maintenance organisation hmo wishes to hedge out its exposure to annual medical cost inflation in the us and that the health industry accounts for slightly less than two zero of us gross domestic product what can this hmo do now in the traditional markets to mitigate this risk not much but jp morgan could offer derivatives based directly upon this very important measure in order to offer a risk management product for this hmo he said both jp morgan and deutsche bank are expecting early interest from financial institutions and fixedincome participants in particular because no mechanism for isolating and hedging or speculating on the growth rate of a countrys economy currently exists deutsche banks strategy for introducing the new products will initially hinge on drumming up internal interest said kevin rodgers global head of currency options at deutsche bank in london in january the banks trading desks will start using it internally to hedge their own positions this activity will be useful in providing the bank with probability distributions he added deutsche bank will then try to get other banks proprietary and swap desks to use the system the new products will probably be available for use by hedge funds commodity trading advisers and fund managers by the third quarter of next year jp morgan chase expects to

yahoocom mark_cliftondellcom hendon brian jpolaseketgicc mike_reddellhotmailcom fredzorillioncom subject the history of aggie civilization this is good the history of aggie civilization the history of the aggie people is as confusing and complex as any culture that exists on earth yet unlike many peoples that have adapted and evolved in response to external and internal influences over the centuries the aggies have largely remained true to their roots and theyre proud of it as a result of passing on their beliefs and practices over the years their behavior over time has been remarkably consistent it is this consistency that makes them an exciting and fascinating group to study who are the aggies the relationship between the aggies and morons idiots and okies are often misunderstood contrary to widespread belief the aggies are considered and consider themselves a separate people from the morons idiots and okies historically the true stupidity of aggies has largely dominated over and outnumbered all three other groups combined the misconception that the four groups are related probably stems from the fact that morons and idiots have imitated many rituals and behaviors practiced by the aggies however aggies are a distinct group although recent evidence solomon shyster et alone nine nine five suggests that at one time probably early in the century aggies and okies lived together and interbred in parts of southern oklahoma and texas hence arkansas was populated by their offspring what largely separates aggies from the others groups is their social interaction unlike okies idiots and morons aggies are highly social creatures that tend to validate each others views and beliefs this can lead to what scholars call a groupthink delusion it is believed that these delusions are the glue that have bound aggies everywhere together over the years the history of the aggie school of thought actually begins in ancient greece with the early philospher slocumedes who was the first to recognize that the absence of everything is equivalent to nothing he had a large number of stupid followers and much of his works is still passed on from parent to child today stupicles from pheces taught that all things could be crushed by a large enough piece of wood his students known as woodpeckers practiced pet embalming hand gestures organized grunting and mastered many techniques in consuming solid food through their nasal cavities stupicles was also a prolific writer unfortunately his twelve volumes of philosophical works which he wrote entirely in the sand on an egyptian beach was lost during a high mediterranean tide with the rise of the roman empire many aggies sought the stability and steady work afforded by slavery the aggies however made poor slaves and many were forced into christianity for entertainment of monks and so that they could be fed to the lions others were driven out of the roman empire into northern europe where they settled many colonies the void left by the fall of the roman empire provided the aggies an opportunity to flourish unhindered in europe hence poland and france were populated the aggies didnt fare so well during the industrial revolution since the philosophical and scientific frameworks of descartes and newton didnt give much leeway to superstition and planned ignorance more and more aggies found themselves falling into the ranks of the working masses aggies caused many early industrial accidents as they tried to fit into this rapidly changing society and evidence of their engineering prowess remains such as the leaning tower of pisa their ways and practices were not appreciated in the new european culture however and increasingly many aggies sought refuge across the ocean in america that is those who didnt wind up sinking their ships in the north atlantic part of the problem in identifying an aggie is that they look and act much like anyone else until they do or say something decidedly stupid most aggies dont think of themselves as morons but rather as intelligent individuals this makes it very difficult to reason with an aggie stupid acts can take many forms and vary in degree but when an aggie commits one it is unmistakable the majority of the times a aggie turns out to be nothing more than an inconvenience and source of humor to the innocent bystander these incidents are played out on city streets supermarkets and country dairy queens daily however there are times when these acts can get out of hand and be devastating it is always wise to be on alert and prepared and stay away from large stacks of logs maroonclad men wielding binoculars or people with shaved heads with swords at times you may find yourself in close proximity to an aggie in the midst of a stupid spell it is good advice not to approach them during an incident unless accompanied by a trained professional if you find that you have no choice then speak slowly and use small soothing words never try to outwit an aggie since they will only interpret that as a hostile and aggressive act always let the aggie think they are superior and under no circumstances let your face or hands pets or livestock near aggies mouth keep in mind at all times that although an aggie may seem intelligent and civilized they are not it is an adaptive disguise developed over the centuries beware be safe and be orange

with the previous two zero zero three compliance deadline the nox sip call regulations were on the same time schedule as the section one two six petitions which were approved by epa though a separate regulatory process a nearlyidentical fallback to the nox sip call for many of the same sources and states as the nox sip call the section one two six rule is going to be litigated starting this coming november but the court has not yet issued a stay of those regulation nor has it delayed the compliance deadline to two zero zero three unless the court places a stay on the one two six rule and delays the compliance deadline to two zero zero four sources could still be required to make substantial nox reductions starting in may two zero zero three we expect the courts to resolve this issue sometime before the one two six litigation commences in early november enron activities sips are being developed by the states with a deadline of october three one so environmental strategies will be spending the next few months working to ensure that the rules that are crafted in the states provide the most favorable treatment possible for our assets while providing a competitive advantage to our traders while the delay could benefit some enron assets that need to comply with the regulations it could also benefit our competitors who have another year to defer environmental compliance decisions that

delainey forwarded by david w delaineyhouect on zero six one nine two zero zero zero one one five seven am from tim belden on zero six one nine two zero zero zero zero seven three zero am pdt to david w delaineyhouectect cc subject re fort james amortization i try to run clean conservative books to that end i assessed every single originated transaciton when i took over the group in one nine nine nine edith cross and i turned over every rock that we could find booked things properly and moved on i know nothing about this amortization thats been going on perhaps there were two payments to fort james one being the payment that west power trading expensed in one nine nine seven associated with the in money waunahalsey position and the other associated with the overall alliance west power trading very clearly liquidated the payment associated with waunahalsey in one nine nine seven i have the dpr from march of one nine nine seven to prove it if this payment was capitalized for some reason after west power trading expensed it then im not sure what to do it seems odd for us to pay for the same bad position twice if the amortization is associated with the second payment to fort james the alliance payment then we have a different kettle of fish entirely i dont understand why it was ok for the amotization to hit the industrial group but when we do a onetime amortization of the balance it all of a sudden switches over to the west power trading group how come last month it was proper for the charge to hit the industrial group and this month it is proper for the charge to hit west power trading the charge should hit whoevers rc it was who thought that paying fort james a bunch of money was a good idea if that person is no longer around the charge should either hit that persons successor or it should hit a management book to your point about who benefits from the termination of this deal clearly it is a good idea to terminate these deals and remove bad positions with a lot of uncertainty from the west power trading books having said that i have a hard time feeling good about the benefit that west power trading has received from these deals in one nine nine nine i was told that this was largely a legal question a memo written by jake thomas on april seven one nine nine nine memorializes this line of thought we established a five zero zero k legal reserve rebooked the deals took most of the positive value to the book to offset large losses associated with other old deals and granted the remainder about one million to jake in origination the entity that has benefited the most from these deals is west origination finally i cant see how this expense belongs to west power trading i would like to understand how all of the accounting worked before i can accept an expense on my rc if you want to deal with the expense separately and have a discussion about granting origination for terminating this deal then lets do that that discussion needs to reflect history and include the origination that was granted in one nine nine seven one nine nine nine and include the legal reserve of five zero zero k give me a call when you get a chance david w delainey zero six one six two zero zero zero zero five one one pm to tim beldenhouectect cc subject fort james amortization tim my understanding is that partnership fee the one one zero m has been amortized for the last several years and expensed to the industrial groups mcconville and ondarza as you are aware i sued them for breach the settlement involved the elimination of all existing transactions between ft james and enron including the wauna and halsey power contracts it is my understanding that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the portland shop the elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement i originated it seemed logical to charge the portland office with the remaining unamortized fee of one eight m as a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent liability lets discuss regards delainey forwarded by david w delaineyhouect on zero six one six two zero zero zero zero seven zero

james amortization edith cross and i looked at the fort james deal in great detail in early one nine nine nine when the deal was closed west power trading booked an in the money position and an offsetting expense of about one one million this money has already liquidated from our book in fact i have a copy of the three three one nine seven dpr that reflects this liquidation at that time west power trading also paid a three five zero k credit reserve two four seven k to the finance book and one three million in origination i have also heard about a partnership fee that enron paid to fort james around the same time im not sure what this fee was and who benefitted from it it had nothing to do with the west power trading book on johns recommendation i called wes to see if we could figure this out wes please give me a call back to discuss i think that someone needs to look at the actual journal entries from march of one nine nine seven to see why an expense of one one million was deferred this is not my problem i should not receive this expense until this is resolved i would greatly appreciate it if the writedown of the deferred account does not hit west power tradings

Legislation,memorandum to regulatory affairs committee power marketers working group legislative affairs committee from jim steffes regulatory affairs committee chair bob reilley power marketers working group chair scott weiner legislative affairs committee chair mark bennett senior manager of policy donn salvosa manager of government affairs date august one six two zero zero one re reliability legislation we are providing you with this memo to provide some information and perspective on the important issues relating to federal legislation in advance of our august two zero th joint regulatory affairs and legislative affairs meeting on reliability legislation reliability legislation s two zero seven one s two zero seven one sponsored by sen slade gorton rwa was approved by the senate in the last congress the house of representatives did not act on the bill s two zero seven one represents the only consensus bill to be approved by either chamber this legislation would establish a national electric reliability organization ero with the authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability standards ferc would have primary jurisdiction over the electric reliability organization ero all affiliated regional reliability entities entities to which authority would be delegated to enforce compliance with reliability standards all system operators and all users of the bulkpower system the bill prescribes procedural guidelines for ferc approval of applications competing for status as the ero and ero standards it would also require all users of the transmission system to comply with such standards what causes us some concern are a number of provisions in the legislation that would delegate authority to different entities the bill would allow the ero subject to ferc approval to delegate authority to a requesting regional entity to implement and enforce compliance with standards include a broad savings clause which preserves state authority to ensure the safety adequacy and reliability of electric service within each state not ensure that the boundaries of arres and rtos are the same although it would instruct arres to cooperate with rtos to ensure enforcement of standards a similar bill hr two six zero two was introduced in the house last session by rep albert wynn dmd no action was taken on this bill the same language is included in the comprehensive energy bill introduced by senate energy and natural resources committee chairman jeff bingaman dnm other developments last year in response to failed attempts by the congress to pass comprehensive electricity legislation a number of groups headed by nerc sent a letter to house speaker j dennis hastert ril calling for the passage of stand alone reliability legislation the letter is attached a number of groups including public power groups the california iso edison electric institute naruc and the national rural electric cooperative association all signed the letter epsa was strongly pressured to sign the letter to add more weight and credibility to the effort however we did not sign the letter while we stated that we did not oppose the letter epsas position at the time was the advocacy for comprehensive federal legislation last month a number of groups with interests in reliability legislation met in washington in an attempt to forge an agreement on legislation that can be supported by industry stakeholders efforts were made to shorten the existing legislation similar to the bill introduced by rep albert wynn without changing the intent of provisions in the language in addition to epsa other groups in attendance included naruc the pennsylvania puc entergy pjm public power groups consumer groups elcon mirant and enron the meeting produced a realization among the participants on the wide difference of opinions on how best to proceed the state pucs lobbied for a continued state role in reliability language entergy supported the original language contained in the bingaman bill still a number of other groups favored the shorter pjm version pjm proposal pjm recently circulated condensed reliability language the four page bill would give enforcement authority to ferc if you would like a copy faxed to you please contact michael reddy mreddyepsaorg at epsa additionally ferc would establish reliability standards and will maintain primary jurisdiction ferc would designate a national reliability entity composed of a number of regional entities for the purpose of developing reliability standards for the transmission system some concerns over the pjm language include formation of regional entities that would be a bottoms up organization these entities would have no regard to how they conform with rtos reliability standards would be developed as voluntary consensus standards the regions and the national entity would be on equal ground revised nerc language just last thursday nerc convened another meeting for the purposes of attempting to shorten the original nerc language working off of the language found in the wynn bill the new language was shortened to one six pages the redlined version is attached among the noteworthy changes p six applications for approval to become the ero strikes language to specify funding mechanisms and requirements p one three changes in filings of funding and funding procedures language deleted on specifics on changes to funding p two one additional language added to state that neither the ero nor ferc will have the authority to order construction of additional generation or transmission if it determines a need p two two language on coordination with rtos deleted status and prospects of legislation the republican house and the leadership of the house energy and commerce committee chaired by rep wj billy tauzin rla and subcommittee on energy and air quality chairman joe barton rtx has maintained the position that electricity should be addressed in a comprehensive fashion this is a continuation of the position held by former house commerce chairman tom bliley rva staff for chairman tauzin are in the process of developing electricity provisions during the august recess it is likely that one of the titles will be on reliability the senate with its recent switch in control remains uncertain on the overall view of stand alone reliability legislation in its present version senate energy chairman bingamans bill contains the same reliability provisions found in the wynn bill chairman bingaman also plans to markup legislation in the fall regulatorynercgisb developments while the timing and details of reliability legislation remain uncertain nerc has continued its effort to transition to naero when first envisioned several years ago the legislative objective was to establish naero as a selfregulatory organization with authority to enforce mandatory reliability standards legislative delays however led the nerc board to take unilateral steps to advance the transition beginning with its governance structure last february the three eight member board was replaced by a new board of ten independent board members members of the former board then were reconstituted as the new stakeholder committee with an advisory role in addition to authority to participate in funding board member changes and a few other general matters also the board implemented a compliance program based upon contracts to be executed by the regional reliability councils funding for nerc presently administered by the regions remains an extremely problematic open question as is the continued dominance of transmission providers in the current nerc standing committee voting structure the gisb proposal to include a wholesale electric quadrant in the new energy industry standards board eisb has provided an alternative that didnt exist at the time the naero concept and related legislative effort began the eisb model which would combine the development of gas and electric retail and wholesale standards initially viewed as a remote prospect when it was floated in early two zero zero zero has gained substantial momentum during fercs june one nine th technical conference on function eight and interregional coordination the commissioners compared the circumstances in the gas industry that led to the formation of gisb with those of the electric industry today in separate letters to gisb executive director rae mcquade dated august one three th commissioners massey wood and brownell observed the need to develop uniform rules and standards and expressed enthusiastic support for a new eisb to do it those letters were distributed during an industry conference hosted by the department of energy doe on august one four one five th further contributing to the credibility of the eisb proposal meanwhile the pressure that the eisb proposal is generating clearly appears to have become part of the overall context for nercs reform effort as well as the reliability legislation a task force set up by the nerc stakeholder committee is reviewing how to make the three standing committees more open and inclusive including possible recommendations to change the voting structure from the current five zero five zero transmission providertransmission customer to a sector approach the nerc board may receive those recommendations and other possible nerc reforms including a new organization standards process when it meets in october the effort to launch an eisb is expected to come to a head when the gisb board meets on september one nine th there are indications that the board will approve going forward with the proposal such action would considerably raise the stakes for the nerc board and present challenging issues regarding how to set up the voting sectors within the wholesale electric quadrant additionally the industry will need to consider how to more precisely define the types of standards the new organization would develop the emergence of a new eisb if it occurs could potentially diverge from legislation that presumes that nercnaero will be the only standard setting organization granting a new naero authority over reliability will beg serious questions regarding its scope of activities and create the specter of multiple organizations that many hope to avoid hastert letter final zero

2000-12-13,"[""'webmaster@cera.com'""]",,California on the Brink--CERA Alert,cera alert december one three two zero zero zero title california on the brink cera knowledge areas western energy n american power n american gas california on the brink the california stalemate california moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the california market while numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation the current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation the collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases the california public utilities commission denied the requests of pacific gas electric and southern california edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy this has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market the current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry however there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled in the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws in the six months since californias supply shortfall began plaguing western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions these include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting process medicine worse than the illness several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall the void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of californias electric market woes challenging siting and permitting despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities price caps discourage investment state and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state repeated rule changes frequent rule changes in the iso markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development calls for refunds despite reports by the power exchange the iso and the ferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the california markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development facility inspections recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust ceras recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west are not guaranteed to make a profit prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment cera estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in two zero zero one in addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until two zero zero three at the earliest therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage the road to recovery there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall encourage new build supply must be part of the answer this requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build while in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself for now there is still not enough new supply coming on until two zero zero three to relieve supply tightness stabilize investment climate utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power this provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios one of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers with the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments if they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response although originally a feature of californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response encourage market mechanisms that dampen the boom bust characteristic of the market whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the california power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility avoid continuously tinkering with the market while the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in california continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market california needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course allow for greater environmental flexibility the state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions free purpa power plants to generate relief should be granted to purpa power plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power end this cera alert will be available in pdf format within two four hours this

allen yes enron ryan um iso allen this isnt on a recorded line but we wanted to do that because of some of the things that we are seeing it would be good to keep it the market clearing price for

allen were not no were not okay we already talked to the dayahead research guy and myself but we saw you guys clear at nine one and we wanted you if its possible to continue to set that whether its two zero mw or whatever you want to put in there enron ryan okay um iso allen we want to clear it at that because of some issues we are seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market enron ryan oh yeah because it had been clearing like at one zero zero hadnt it iso allen not replacement enron ryan oh not replacement iso allen no what happened is that we bought it backsee the dayahead was purchased at like one zero zero and then what happened is that the hourahead a bunch of these people were buying it back for a penny over the inter ties they were faking it so we wanted to keep the price up high allen and ryan unintelligible enron ryan so they were selling it oh in the day ahead and buying it back iso allen buying like six zero bucks trying to make money off of it

zero one independent newspapers uk limited nothing about californias electricity crisis is turning out as expected this was supposed to be the summer of skyhigh wholesale prices and non stop rolling blackouts but they havent happened in fact if you were to take a tour of the golden state now you would be hard pressed to notice there was a crisis at all the lights are on and everyone is still here thats mostly because of a fluke of nature the weather has been uncannily mild and so demand for airconditioning and refrigeration systems in particular has been significantly reduced it also helps in a perverse sort of way that the economy has been slowing down particularly the energyguzzling hitech sector consumption fell by one one per cent in june even before a round of retail price increases kicked in on one july and by five per cent in july contrary to dire predictions wholesale prices have in fact been falling thats not all that has gone against expectations we heard californias governor gray davis and his supporters accuse private energy generating suppliers of gouging prices the worst of them they said were based in the presidents home state of texas however powerbuying statistics published last month showed that texas companies like enron and dynergy had in fact sold california only one zero per cent of its electricity since the beginning of the year much less than the canadians say and that the highest spotrate prices of all had in fact been charged by californiabased concerns we were also told to expect a showdown between california and the federal government californians went the common wisdom were hapless victims of a failed deregulation that had left them at the mercy of ruthless generating companies moreover their appeals for help from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc were falling on deaf ears because the president and his advisors were all in the pocket of those selfsame companies this picture too has been complicated by recent events under heavy pressure ferc has reluctantly agreed to impose reasonably effective price caps not only on california but on all the western states at the same time californias public officials themselves have been shown to be in the pocket of energy companies two veterans of the gore presidential campaign brought in by governor davis recently resigned because it turned out they were simultaneously working for southern california edison one of the states two giant power utilities five other advisors were dismissed because of their personal holdings in energy stocks while a sixth quit of his own accord a further eight are under investigation the conflict of interest has reached governor davis press spokesman steve maviglio who agreed last week to sell his one two zero zero zero pounds eight four five zero stake in a california energy company calpine that had been noticeably absent from his public criticisms of the price gougers it has also reached the chairman of the california energy commission bill keese who has just agreed to sell more than five zero zero zero zero zero in energy holdings some of them in companies that have come before him on regulatory matters given the confusion into which the politics of the crisis has descended it is tempting to look at the lights burning both on hollywood boulevard and the san francisco hilltops and conclude that there is nothing out of the ordinary but the crisis is far from over its not over because none of the underlying causes have been addressed says mark bernstein an energy specialist with the rand corporation as things stand californias largest utility pacific gas electric pge is in bankruptcy court and the secondlargest southern california edison is still scrambling around for ways to avoid the same fate the state government has become the sole official buyer of energy creating severe imbalances in the budget and effectively putting all nonessential public programmes on hold total energy expenditure in california is expected to reach seven zero bn this year compared with seven bn last year with the state picking up much of the slack there are hopes the state could eventually withdraw from the wholesale market but nobody yet knows how there is a complicated court battle going on to secure rebates from the generating companies for overcharging the rebates could go as high as nine bn although it is not clear whether the recipients would be the utilities or the state the rebates will almost certainly get sucked into pges bankruptcy settlement further complicating the issue meanwhile the root causes of the crisis have hardly changed an improperly deregulated market with too few power sources too little transmission infrastructure and a dearth of active players in a position to create a truly free market if nothing changes dr bernstein says the shortages uncontrolled price rises and rolling blackouts will simply be postponed until next summer or whenever the next demand crunch hits much of the political debate has focussed on generating plants whether local authorities have been too slow to build them or too reluctant on environmental grounds but the state of the transmission grid is arguably a bigger problem not only in california where there is a northsouth bottleneck in the san joaquin valley but across the country last month las vegas suffered a blackout because there was no way to funnel emergency power supplies there quickly enough since there is no direct northsouth transmission line through nevada the power has to travel either through california a nogo in the current situation or through utah which was experiencing similarly high demand at the time one can anticipate similar problems in new york state and new england where the dense population makes it hard to build new transmission lines or in florida which has just two electric line connections to the wider united states both of which were operating at capacity during last winters peak season given the states continuing population growth it wouldnt take more than a bit of freak weather or a power plant going down unexpectedly for the great electricity crisis to hit there as well you can build as many power plants as you like but if you dont have the grid to transmit the electricity they wont do you any good dr bernstein remarked the white house energy plan recently unveiled focuses almost entirely on energy production not on distribution or conservation if implemented in its current form by congress it is unlikely energy specialists say to do much to alleviate the core us problem californias respite this summer could well be the calm before a much wider storm caption los angeles citywalk area during a blackout in may analysts are concerned the problems in us

the public profile in this country of the us energy company enron was pretty low the one zero zero bn firm owns wessex water but lacks the consumer recognition of other highprofile energy operators such as exxon shell and bp but behind the scenes in high political circles enron is extremely well known it is a company that gives the appearance of securing what it wants either here such as when the labour government came to office vowing not to allow any more new private gasfired power stations only to relent in enrons case on teesside or in the us where the firm is the best connected of any to the new president george bush or even in india where despite enormous public hostility it was the driving force behind plans for a massive power station that was built at dabhol near bombay in

her husband baba was a leader of those who were protesting against the building of the plant villagers complained they would be overcharged for their electricity while there were allegations of corruption involving state officials local people were also displaced and concerns were raised about environmental damage local constructors paid the state government for the hire of reserve police to

king simon mcrae of friends of the earth said when you look at their influence in government policy making in areas like climate change they know how to throw their weight around determined to succeed in britain the firm hired the political lobbying organisation gjw one of gjws employees subsequently boasted to an undercover journalist how he would ensure enron would overcome the government ban on private gasfired stations the way you go about it is that you play on the existing prejudices within the cabinet for coal you play on the existing prejudices within the cabinet for competition and you play the forces off against each other its intimate knowledge of whats going on that produces results in the end the lobbyist did well and enron got its power stations the company continues to wield

willing to sell its six five stake in the troubled dabhol power co to the indian government in exchange for the money it had invested in the project in the interest of quickly resolving this dispute enron has expressed a willingness to forgo expected profits and negotiate terms that would allow the indian authorities to acquire the foreign stakeholders interests in dpc enron said in a written statement enron insisted however that it and co investors general electric co and bechtel which each own one zero recoup all that they had invested in the two nine billion project enron and its partners would still need to recover one zero zero of their costs the statement continued the company is willing to take this step and forgo significant profits on its investment if the dispute can be resolved amicably with full recovery of our costs in the near term press reports have pegged enrons investment at one billion enron spokesman johan zaayman wouldnt disclose how much enron and its partners had invested in the two nine billion project we are seeking to sell the equity weve invested in the project but were not talking about any specific amounts yet he said its too early john

what they were getting into in india you cant win you cant get even and you cant even get out of the game enron and dabhols primary customer the maharashtra state electricity board which owns one five of the project have been locked in a bitter dispute since april over investment payment and pricing issues enron has charged mseb with failing to invest in the projects second phase and defaulting on four five million in electricity payments mseb countered that dabhols electricity prices were too high it stopped buying power from the facility in may enrons sale of its stake in the project would be a big blow to india it is indias biggest foreign investment to date and enrons departure could scare away other companies from investing in the country arlington va power plant developer aes corp is

and finance ministries for a buyout of its troubled project by central utilities the dabhol power company dpc has approached the prime minister mr ab vajpayee with a similar proposal according to top sources in a letter to the prime minister dpc has offered to sell its equity in the project to the government for one billion on a noprofit noloss basis interestingly when contacted dpc chief mr wade cline told business line that a private letter to this effect had been recently sent to the power and finance ministry representatives mr kline clarified that so far no company has approached them for buying out their stake in dpc the union power minister mr suresh prabhu however maintained that the power ministry had not received any such communication the power and finance ministries have been of the view that their role in resolving the issue would be restricted to finding buyers for phase ii of the power project which has a capacity of one four one five mw even as dpc has knocked at the doors of the pmo the lenders to the project are at present talking to the stakeholders mseb dpc and the centre for reducing the tariff so as to find buyers for the power from the second phase informally the centre has been consulted on the possible revenue losses if the duty on the lng terminal is waived this is likely to be of the order of around rs three zero zero crore the other variable is the transmission charges for transfer of power to the neighbouring purchasing states as per the counterguarantee agreement between the centre state and the dpc which alone binds the centre contractually the centres liability is restricted to payment of outstanding energy bills of dpc for past power sale to maharashtra state electricity board and payment of foreign debt up to three zero zero million the sequence of events leading up to the dpc communique to the prime minister are worth recalling sometime in march this year the company had informally sent a proposal to the government to sell its equity in the project for one billion the report published in this paper was however denied on june nine this year when enron worldwide chief mr kenneth lay met with the power minister mr suresh prabhu his proposal to the centre to buyout the project was again shot down further the enron chiefs request to meet with the prime minister did not fructify now nearly two months later the company has sent a proposal directly to the prime minister seeking his intervention for the centre to buyout the project for one billion in parliament meanwhile the union minister of state for power

early solution to the problem and to the mutual satisfaction of the parties concerned we are not washing our hands off it we have taken number of steps towards reduction of tariff i cant give you an absolute number right now as it depends on variables like fuel costs capacity utilization even lenders have agreed to lower rates we are working on the number enron wants to exit the venture as it is

compliance plan for meeting the varied retail regulatory requirements in the states where epmi sells to industrials they came up with the suggestion as discussed further below of having epmi deregister as an esp in california and instead become a nonregistered esp i understand that epmi could still sell to large industrials under this classification first can you remember the historical reason of why epmi registered as an esp to begin with but with the qualification that it only intended to serve large industrials there may have been an important strategic decision to do so second is there any reason why epmi should not deregister as an esp and become a nonregistered esp i look forward to hearing from you please feel free to call me at seven one three three four five seven four

zero two one nine pm janet as you know epmi is currently classified with the california public utilities commission cpuc as a registered esp esp one zero eight six epmi may want to consider deregistering with the cpuc and instead benefit from classification as a nonregistered esp i have confirmed that an esp must only register with the cpuc prior to serving residential and small commercial customers the cpuc defines a small commercial customer as a customer that has a maximum peak demand of less than two zero kw per meter for at least nine billing periods during the most recent one two month period see cpuc o three three one h and pge tariff rule two two as epmi has indicated in its license application that it only intends to serve large commercial customers and per our discussions does not have immediate plans to serve small commercial customers epmi may elect to deregister and become a nonregistered esp the primary advantage of deregistering is that epmi as a nonregistered esp would no longer have continued reporting and compliance requirements with the cpuc including the annual submission of a standard service plan filing application update and license renewal additionally as a nonregistered esp epmi would no longer have the ongoing obligation to notify the cpuc within five days of changes in address or phone numbers and to notify the cpuc of all other material changes including changes to officers and directors within six zero days i have confirmed with a contact at the energy division of the cpuc on an anonymous basis that a registered esp can deregister with the cpuc by sending a letter to the address below requesting cancellation of esp registration status california public utilities commission energy division electric service provider registration fourth floor five zero five van ness avenue san francisco ca nine four one zero two our source at the cpuc also confirmed that the cpuc exercises no regulatory jurisdiction over a nonregistered esp nonregistered esps however can file a complaint at the cpuc against a jurisdictional utility over issues dealing with the utilitys compliance with its tariffs with respect to esps please note that while nonregistered esps do not have ongoing reporting and compliance requirements with the cpuc both registered esps and nonregistered esps must submit various environmental compliance filings with the california energy commission and if participating in the greene program make additional filings with the center for resource solutions for additional information on these

issue of developing a new form of template with andrea and asked that we discuss the issue with robert george distribution contractsthe commercial group would like to have preapproved distribution contract forms available to give to customers so that the customer can submit them to the distribution company when electing a commercial bypass only two distributors have had their form approved by the enargas we are looking into what we can offer to our customers in the other distribution territories to speed the process of finalising distribution contracts with the ldcs to avoid long delays enargas expedientesenargas has issued an order to enron to amend three of its gas contracts to modify references to firm transportation and to unbundle the pricing the enargas also sent a letter to our customers which we feel overstepped their regulatory role the meeting between roberto pensoti and hector formica was held last thursday roberto had a follow up phone conversation with hector on friday and had a meeting monday morning with alicia federico to get a feel for the amount of resistance we will get we have been given a three zero day extension to respond to the order in order to have meetings with the enargas and try to come to some resolution on this issue the first meeting will be scheduled early next week neuquen tax assessmentandrea has faxed or emailed the pertinent information regarding the stamp tax assessment on the technical assistance agreement between tgs and epca to george frumkin anna sepulveda and michelle blaine who will coordinate with tgs and perez companc on the strategy for responding to the assessment michelle will call tgs outside counsel today in order to hire him to also represent epca epca has filed its response to neuquen using the arguments prepared by tgs on january two seven michelle blaine has requested information regarding what the next step by neuquen might possibly be we will look into the issue tax lobbyingjordan mintz and terry thorn are proposing a series of meetings with government officials in late february and have asked carlos bastos to see if he can also arrange a meeting with mr lenicov at that time issues include determining whether the stamp tax and turnover tax issues can be lobbied at the national level or only at the provincial level there is a proposal that was floated that the turnover tax could be included in the vat tax scheme which might solve the problem with the turnover tax the focus of the meetings is to determine how a lobbying strategy can be developed and who should be involved in the actual lobbying process jordan mintz is handing off the responsibility he had assumed on this issue to jim ginty jordan has asked carlos bastos to see if he can set up a meeting with mr lenicov on

five comments were made on february five vandenfilvandenfil has filed for a prebankruptcy proceeding which has not yet been opened by the court due to the january recess for the last three months vandenfil has made their payments only after our sending them termination notices with a two business day cure period the most likely scenario during the preliminary bankruptcy period is that our contract will be continued by the trustee giving us a priority in payment for ongoing deliveries of gas after the preliminary bankruptcy is opened if we have not been served notice that our contract is continued within three zero days we would be allowed to terminate the contract one of the risks that we face with this customer is that they may argue to the trustee that we cannot terminate the contract claiming we are providing a public service imasa bidformat of enrons original proposal structure changed enron and albanesi submitted joint termsheet to central puerto in november where enron proposed signing two contracts with central puerto one for the supply of all the gas transportation and another for the supply for six zero percent of the gas requirements and albanesi proposed two

from ferc is urgent some urged f or one mandatory design for north america one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation the commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward they continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like do we need to issue a megaorder that addresses all these issues and how much detail do you need us to provide general feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas kormos and burkes went so far as t o say ferc should mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation two zero one item of interest wood referred to the filing made by the electronic sc heduling collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e rto design and rto implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to rto design korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry the se ction to which wood referred was one that i wrote and asked the following questions congestion management when operational security violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient will lmp based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated transmission service are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowedtwo zero loop flows are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate if contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed grandfathered transmission service should contracts existing pr ior to rto development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts are there other solutions energy imbalance markets how are imbalance markets to function will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all ancillary services will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime polr charges losses can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy nonjurisdictionals how are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an rto or should they be designed to t reat each nje as a separate entity hopefully ferc will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie lmp with financi al hedging instruments will take only months the commission asked mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed now for a funny point one of the commissioners i think breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes lmp inefficient for the northwest kormos flat out said my profession is understanding how power systems work and i dont believe that that statement is true he then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the northwest interests was false nerc and gisb a great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization massey went so far as to ask are we looking at a bea uty contest between nerc and gisb cook and boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations other participants cont inually reiterated the need for one independent organization interesting ly boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in gi sb while cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of nerc and did not focus on its history brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of gisb by pointedly a sking both cook and boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder gisb was easily a ble to say they were not but nerc of course had to admit to their romancin g of congress and the bush administration for reliability legislation poin t brownell mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for nerc playing dave cooks yesm an he probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to nercs suppos ed successes such as tlr and etag if staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions we may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture marty painted was in fact a fiction there was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that i could not be done there was also some talk of folding nerc under gisbeisb the arguments began winding down after a some time and boswell strongly ur ged the commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether nerc or gisb should lead the industry forward nerc s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position in general i would say it was a close fight but gisb came out more on top let me know if you have any

know who originated it or to whom the we refers as in we would like to ask all the people that aside there is validity to the charges of bias and lack of evenhandedness of cnn in its mideast reporting it is being sent in its entirety read on sjb for the last few years we have watched cnns unbalanced pro arab coverage of the middleeast conflict this fact may or may not explain cnns biased coverage saudi prince alaweed bin tabel bin abdel aziz al saud the one who offered ny mayor giuliani one zero million has one six billion invested in american companies including nine three two million in cnns parent aoltime warner oct two two time mag pg two two jr through the years cnn has pushed a pro arab anti israel agenda by giving arab representatives more airtime by selectively reporting on palestinian casualties while ignoring the ones on the israeli side cnn also more frequently than not uses active text when palestinians are killed israelis killed palestinians and passive text when israelis are killed israelis were killed not mentioning that they were killed by palestinians another example of cnn bias is their reporting of the frequent attacks by large groups of palestinians against israeli army posts with few soldiers in them the soldiers have two choicesget lynched like the ones the palestinians lynched in ramalla or defend themselves while defending themselves they kill a few of the attackers cnn headline will usually read something like israeli soldiers shoot and kill five palestinians cnn does not report that the palestinians caused the incident cnn has also failed to report that following the september one one tragedy the palestinian authority confiscated reporters tapes that showed palestinians celebrating in the streets the deaths of thousands of americans the palestinian authority also threatened reporters and told them that they cannot guarantee their safety if they continue to reports these celebrations and cnn has taken to calling the terrorists who destroyed the wtc buildings and hit the pentagon suspected hijackers jr verified reuters has done the same responding to pressure from the arabs and out of fear for their middle east reporters safety until recently there was no any alternative to cnn and therefore we all watched it now fox news has two four hours a day service the coverage is much more balanced honest and fair israeli representatives are given equal time to express their side and the news reporters are much more objective in their comments we would like to ask all the people who care about israel about fairness truth and honest reporting to boycott cnn and start watching fox news you might also want to write to cnn and tell them what you are doing and why it would also be a good idea to write to the

mdea original message from mann kay sent wednesday may two three two zero zero one five zero six pm to rorschach reagan kroll heather fairley david may tom subject open items for mdea fairley david here are issues which im unclear about all of which impact the drafting of the agreement one how are we setting the heat rate do we have the gads is it a daily average weekly average flat rate adjusted if so how often fairley david each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate exhibit and the stack model as conditions change the utilities must update this info we are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage services and orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry it can never be exact but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability no gads heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps two are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions fairley david yes their units are too small we have discussed this with the customer and with our internal air permit guys rorschach reagan they have title v permits and they are faxing them to us today they have no run hour limitations on gas however they are limited on oil will need to get that summary to kay as soon as possible three we have determined that we wont deal with fuel oil right fairley david we wont buy and sell fuel oil we may dispatch on oil at startup or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable which constitutes a product transaction with the resulting profit split rorschach reagan we need to state that mdea and cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies four we arent making money on gas right fairley david we make money on gas two ways the first is outside the contract and is basicly any internal profit on resale of gas to the cities the second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a product trade and those procedures apply five do we have a defn of costs that we like yet and if so how does it fit in to the picture fairley david yes will send separately six is there an uptodate set of exhibits fairley david the marketing strategy the trading and risk policy and the description of asset management have been upated the other exhibits have not been modified the marketing strategy and trading risk policy have been discussed at length with mdea mdea commercial not legal and their commentsquestions incorporated seven it would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following in words andor formulae the defn and method of establishing the bogey target production cost formula can be an exhibit which would be great for the commercial team to work on fairley david thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties will look at it again conceptually mdea services group and orig are in full agreement so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough rorschach reagan see attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example are we determined how we should deal with imbalances part of cost of power fairley david there are three considerations on this one who wears imbalance exposure two who manages imbalances hourly type activity and three who pays for imbalances imbalances are billed by entergy directly to mdea under their network services agreement epmis hourly desk manages the loadresource items hourly but mdea has the exposure physical and price to imbalances weatherload changes and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances they happen they are uncontrollable and we fix them which epmis hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties a different section in the contract states that mdea wears the exposure how are we setting the bogey formula fairley david the bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the days activities rorschach reagan records of bogey decisions will be archieved subject to audit fairley david yes but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day frankly they would like to have less involvement ie they trust us to do it all but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day two bogeys or one gas and oil fairley david one bogey for power gas is an input for determining the bogey rorschach reagan bogey set dayahead what is defn of profit i think i have the general idea but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check fairley david this is in the pricing calcs should we have a definition what costs are included on the buy and sell side fairley david see cost definition being provided separately re stack model a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used fairley david see definition in my markups to the main agreement updated exhibit on facilities contracted resources operating limits fairley david services and orig are reviewing these but other than what was mentioned above probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem what information does mdea need for us to provide in order to split costsprofits are we clear that cities buy gas mdea buyssells power rorschach reagan i will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily and monthly we need to make sure to limit our info providing responsibilities to those reports it would be great if i could get one set of answers to these questionsissues which has commercial buy in all around thanks kay,07:14:00,No

meeting kh forwarded by kevin hyattetsenron on one zero three one two zero zero zero one two three seven pm jeffery fawcett one zero two seven two zero zero zero one two three four pm to steven harrisetsenronenron cc kevin hyattetsenronenron subject electric developments i consulted with kevin before i took the oars in trying to answer your question as well as the questions raised in drews email heres what we found out steves question what economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in new mexico maybe three zero zero zero mw and build a line to the grid in california versus us expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in california what youre really asking here is what are the comparative economics of energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline in this analysis there are a few considerations one original capital cost to construct facilities two the operating cost of the facilities including energy loss and three environmental and other permitting considerations engineers tell us that as a rule of thumb high voltage transmission lines and tower facilities cost approximately eight zero zero zero zero zero to one mmmile to construct turnkey this figure is comparable to the one mmmile rule of thumb we use for turnkey construction of mainline diameter three zero three six highpressure steel pipeline in terms of operating costs for anything over one zero zero miles in length there are three three basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission one transformation loss two radiation loss efm and three heat loss across the conductors a rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is three this number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on transwesterns pipeline the most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission lines is in the area of permitting there just arent many new transmission lines being approved it was suggested by more than one source that an electric transmission project on the order posited in your example could take anywhere from six to one zero years to secure authorization the issues of electromagnetic field emf radiation around high voltage power lines along with other wildlife endangerment concerns are significant obstacles in securing permits for rightofway in short the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines the protracted permitting process for electric transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure drews questions one what are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts his plant for purposes of this exercise im assuming were talking gasfired generation developers generally describe four considerations in deciding where to site a new electric power plant one market area demand distributive andor transmission access to market two water rights for turbine cooling three ease of permitting environmental encroachment fedstatelocal regulations affected agenciesjurisdiction four proximity to natural gas pipelinesupply infrastructure two do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various utilitiespower pools vary all that much or are order eight eight eight tariffs pretty much the same all over ferc order eight eight eight and eight eight nine require public utilities to commit to standards of conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and between other utilities andor power pools in the various operating regions ferc ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate their transmissionreliability functions from their wholesale merchant functions the rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under ferc order four three six five zero zero six three six affecting interstate natural gas pipelines its pretty obvious from the california example this past summer that with respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual states particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of independent system operators isos there is substantial room for improvement and possible further ferc involvement in the open access final rule order no eight eight eight the commission issues a single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission service all public utilities that own control or operate interstate transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro forma tariff they must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own wholesale energy sales and purchases order no eight eight eight also provides for the full recovery of stranded coststhat is costs that were prudently incurred to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use open access to move to another supplier three how do ipps decide what fuel supply strategy works best ie buy bundled delivered fuel from someone vs buy gas storage transport etc separately in my experience there is no one size fits all formula or strategy for example in the past weve seen calpine take a very handson approach to supplying its ipp projects in the mid to late eight zero s during the build out of several qfs cogens calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground and dedicated them to the project in todays market calpine has scavenged the gas and basis traders from statoil and setup a natural gas desk for the purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western us power projects in other projects developerowners and their lenders are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supplytransportation to the project in short projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics and secure reliable supply by taking bids or rfps for gas supplytransportation or whether to take a more handson approach ala calpine four what is the rto rule and why should we care last december the ferc issued order no two zero zero zero a final rule on regional transmission organizations rtos order two zero zero zero builds on the foundation of orders eight eight eight and eight eight nine issued in one nine nine six according to ferc chairman jim hoecker order two zero zero zero makes a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations from the influence of electricity market participants therefore order two zero zero zero can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the functional unbundling adopted in orders eight eight eight and eight eight nine continuing balkanization of the electric transmission grid based on corporate not state or regional boundaries as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of privatelyowned transmission companies ferc prescribes a voluntary approach to rto participation the order initiates a regional collaborative process to foster rto formation the order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned public utilities that are subject to ferc jurisdiction and requires these private utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate the needs of transmission owning statemunicipal cooperative and federally owned systems ferc believes that regardless of format rtos will offer the following benefits one alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused by structural changes in the industry two improve efficiencies in transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion management three improve grid reliability four remove remaining opportunities for discriminatory practices five improve market performance six increase coordination among state regulatory agencies seven cut transaction costs eight facilitate the success of state retail access programs and nine facilitate lighterhanded regulation critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility voluntary rto formation and transmission rate reforms ie incentives order two zero zero zero defers for casespecific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved in order to create an operational rto moreover order two zero zero zero does not compel any transmission owner to join an rto but provides only regulatory guidance and incentives for willing participants as well as a veiled threat of further consequences for the holdouts as to the final part of the question why should we care presumably the development of a fullyfunctioning rto network will promote both the efficiency and market transparency goals of the original ferc orders as ferc reads it the future of gasfired generation for both merchant and utility systems depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission system therefore the promise of the rto is to stimulate competition and the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure unfortunately sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the rto program may ultimately cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals five has five mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market natural gas prices of five mmbtu can only kill gasfired power plants in those instances where one there are more economical alternatives to natural gas fuel two demand for electric power is offset through demand side management or three natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly prohibited from use as a power plant fuel in the western us marketplace particularly in california i see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel for electric power generation renewable resources currently meet less than five of the total electric resource requirements three two barrel oil prices give fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas even at a five mmbtu price moreover california environmental and permitting regulations make the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible while demand side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting resource needs historically they have served only a minor role in offsetting the growth in electric power as to the final point im unable to comment on the risk of future legalregulatory restrictions governing the use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel steven harris one zero two six two zero zero zero one zero zero five am to kevin hyattetsenronenron cc jeffery fawcettetsenronenron subject re electric developments since you

mnlsix seven five three five dtl the option to shop around for the best deal on electricity one of the cornerstones of californias deregulation plan could soon be scrapped businesses may lose the right to cut their own deals with private power suppliers and environmentally conscious consumers could be barred from shifting their business from utilities to renewable energy firms unless the legislature acts quickly to save the program the potential cost savings of socalled direct access to competing electricity providers was the plum that incited big businesses to fight hard for deregulation in one nine nine six but the program although it was not responsible for the soaring rates that piled up state and utility debt may be sacrificed in the states drive to recoup its costs the fate of the program was thrown into doubt last winter when skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs collapsed the nascent direct access market weakened the utilities and caused the state to take over power purchases industry has been lobbying hard since then to keep the option open for the future but the problem for gov gray davis administration is that the state needs big industrial consumers to stay on as utility customers to help pay off the eight billion it has already spent buying power and the estimated four three billion worth of power it has contracted to buy over the next two zero years otherwise the utility customers left behind householders and small businesses will be stuck with the whole bill competing proposals to allow companies to bail out by paying an exit fee to cover a share of the cost are working their way through the legislature but time is running short state treasurer philip angelides warned the legislature and the state public utilities commission this month the state plans to issue one two five billion in bonds in september for power purchases and officials say underwriters want to be assured that there is a large enough revenue stream to repay the bonds angelides and other state officials urged the legislature and the puc to decide by the end of june either to ban direct access or lock in a procedure to charge each departing company for its share of the state power costs the hypothetical and theoretical desires for a direct access market and the hypothetical and theoretical desire for a bond sale are now intersecting in reality said assemblyman fred keeley dboulder creek santa cruz county industry advocates agree that firms should pay a fair share of the electricity purchased on their behalf but how much and how to make that calculation is a complex issue they fear will be decided in haste said dorothy rothrock a lobbyist for the california manufacturers and technology association we are reacting to crises real or manmade and making decisions in a rush without considering the consequences rothrock said the puc is set to vote thursday on a proposed urgency measure to suspend direct access as of july one the ban recommended by a puc administrative law judge would continue as long as the state functions as power buyer for utility customers conceivably through the term of state contracts ending in two zero two zero lawmakers had authorized the puc to suspend direct access last winter when the state took over electricity purchasing but a divided puc delayed action as legislators worked with industry to salvage the program although direct access contracts are still legal until the puc acts in effect the program was slammed into suspension by the brutal power price hikes of the past one eight months threatened by exposure to rising wholesale electricity rates virtually all direct access customers have returned to the utilities where they are protected by the state rate freeze even though the right to deal directly with generators has been on the books since one nine nine six few businesses or householders actually did it many of the residential customers who signed on with alternative suppliers did so to support the growth of renewable power like solar and wind energy at its peak the program drew about two two four zero zero zero households about two five percent of the customer base of californias major utilities about one three percent of the industrial market contracted for their own power industry has until tomorrow to file plans with the puc to preserve direct access under a proposal by public utilities commissioner richard bilas a strong supporter of the program commissioner jeff brown said he favors direct access but the continuing uncertainty over the form it would take jeopardizes the states ability to float its bonds commissioner carl wood a direct access opponent said it should be abolished because it creates a danger that residential and small business customers will be stuck paying for relatively highcost contracts secured by the state during the energy crisis while large industries would be free to buy cheap power from the newer more efficient plants that will be coming online in the next few years but wood said even if the puc suspends the option the state legislature could order its reinstatement sen debra bowen dmarina del rey is carrying a bill to do that while requiring the exit fees demanded by angelides and state finance officials without those safeguards utility revenues would dive into a death spiral where rates would

audience of the email this is the intended procedure for use of the dummy account both the east and the west load gas books into the enpower system nightly this is not one persons responsibility but the entire groups responsibility previously the only message we get for this load is a success that all the books went somewhere in enpower with the installation of the new dummy account the message will now tell us if one of the books was loaded to this dummy account if an eol bridge mistakenly puts gas deals in a power gas book that was not correctly mapped the position would go to the dummy account if an eol bridge mistakenly puts gas deals in a power gas book that was correctly mapped the position would show up in that traders gas positions depending on which load east or west has a book that was mapped to the dummy account will determine which group investigates with it what whose positions are now stored in dummy as you have indicated manual processes do inevitably create errors the perfect procedure would be for the book to have complete and correct set up prior to having deals entered into it it would also be ideal if deals could not be entered into this book if setup was incomplete but because this is an interface mapping problem to enpower the tagg gas system does not recognize that the setup is incomplete i am not under the impression that the dummy account is a perfect fix however with the new alert it will provide us better data than we had before and it will keep the unmapped positions out of the west portfolio the only time the west would be affected by this change in the future is if a new power gas book is set up for your traders i hope i have addressed your concerns if i have not please give me a call or email me back thanks stacey three one eight seven zero to stacey w whitehouectect cc subject re potential gas system exposure does any of this impact the west anymore who is going to be alerted when positions are loaded to the dummy account whats the procedure for resolving what happens if eol dumps trades to a dummy account what happens if the person who is watching the dummy account is out sick or on vacation or leaves enron or is asleep at the wheel given the volatility of the commodities that we are trading and the fact that manual processes inevitably create errors as is evidenced by a seven million hit we took yesterday because one keystroke on deal entry was done incorrectly last summer i think its important to raise these issues to tim beldenhouectect cc john j lavoratoenronenronxgate sally beckhouectect beth perlmanenronenronxgate steve natenronenronxgate sheri thomashouectect subject re potential gas system exposure the mapping problem mentioned below is a power desk problem only the mapping problem is purely between the interface of the gas and power trading systems and does not affect the book if it is strictly a gas traders gas book there was one instance when a gas traders transactions were incorrectly bridged to a power traders gas book through eol the root of this problem was with the eol bridge not the interface mapping the procedure to set up a gas book for power traders includes communication to it regarding the appropriate interface mapping of the book if for some reason the mapping does not occur the position will be mapped to a dummy default desk we will be alerted when positions are loaded to the dummy account on a nightly basis in order to investigate the problem and ensure that positions do no get lost in the system if anyone needs to further discuss the problem we have been having and why it is only the power world that is affected please give me a call thanks stacey three one eight seven zero from tim belden zero two one four two zero zero one zero five two five pm to john j lavoratocorpenron stacey w whitehouectect sally beckhouectect beth perlmanhouect steve natcorpenron cc subject potential gas system exposure for some period of time various west power desks have been the default desk which received gas positions for new books that were not properly setup in tagg i have worked with our risk team and the techology group to get west power out of this problem im happy with the result from the west power point of view i am writing to alert you that one half of the problem still exists if someone does a gas deal and hasnt set up a new book properly and doesnt carefully track hisher position the trade goes into a dummy book that nobody manages days weeks or months later you discover the trade and take the hit or the gain i think that this risk is real because we were the ones finding the misplaced gas trades before not the gas desk with the misplaced trade now nobody will find them unless the gas trader realizes that some of hisher position is missing these are the facts as i understand them im sure that stacey white steve nat and monica lande could fill you in with more detailed information let me know if i can be of

solves the problem for us but not for enron as a whole if no one monitors the dummy book on the daily basis which probably wont happen if there is no ownership then you still have the possibility of positions falling into that book and never showing up in the book that they were intended why cant a process be put in place for the initial setup of a book in tagg monica to fran changpdxectect

subject re remaining problem with west tot tim the root problem was related to the default mapping logic in the interface job that moves the erms gas calc results to the portcalc results tables if mapping logic is not set up for a new book the job was defaulting the gas deals to the stplt desk the default mapping has been changed to a dummy zz_erms book which will prevent the deals from showing up in the wrong book if the mapping logic is not updated in reference to beths concerns turns out this was a limitation in our production code not an it change to production data so we should be ok on that front the longterm solution would be to remove the hardcoded logic setup table structures and maintain the mapping rules through a user screen given our other priorities and the default logic change we will not pursue this option let me know if you have any other questions or concerns steve original message from belden tim sent wednesday february one four two zero zero one one one four

natenronenronxgateenron subject re remaining problem with west tot ole object stdolelink the problem is not that we should enter a reversing trade in the system as this would misrepresent the positions across the board the problem is that the position belongs to another book within enpower the users have no access to the screens which define where our gas books are mapped in enpower therefore it has to manually define the correct mapping for us when the manual fix has not been made we have true positions for one book mapped to another book stacey from beth perlmanenronenronxgate

one one two zero _three zero zero zero zero zero zero six pdf the press release california energy commission report released summer of two zero zero one electricity supplies better than expected sacramento california should have enough power to meet its electricity demand next summer unless the state experiences extraordinarily hot weather according to a study released today by the energy commission with new resources coming online and new conservation measures taking effect next summer looks better than expected if we manage our resources properly said steve larson energy commission executive director the study prepared as part of a response to legislation enacted in september quantified the amount of electricity demand and supply expected in the summer of two zero zero one we produced this analysis from the ground up commented larson we looked at every power plant and source of electricity available to the state to give us a realistic appraisal of where we stand for next summer energy commission staff projected expected peak electricity demand using three temperature scenarios the analysis indicated that under the most likely temperature conditions next years electricity peak demand will be four seven two six six megawatts which reflects a reduction of two two zero megawatts of demand because of new utility and state energy conservation initiatives operating reserve requirements add an additional two two zero zero to three zero zero zero megawatts demand in order to provide a seven percent margin raising the generation needed to a minimum of five zero three zero three megawatts if california experiences a warmer than normal summer the electricity system will require four eight eight four five megawatts plus operating reserve requirements which raises the total to five one eight eight two megawatts under this scenario total expected resources are five two five five zero megawatts should the state experience extremely hot temperatures which has a one inone zero year likelihood of occurring five three one zero four megawatts will be needed five zero zero six eight megawatts of demand plus operating reserve requirements with expected resources of five two one nine zero megawatts an additional one eight eight eight three zero eight seven megawatts of potential generation is currently under development and may be available for part or all of the summer the energy commissions demand forecast takes into consideration expected economic conditions and household growth in the state these two factors influence demand for air conditioning which drives summer peak demand for electricity the energy commissions staff supply outlook includes existing instate and outofstate generation new power plants expected to be online and generating electricity by august one two zero zero zero and electricity imports and exports the supply outlook also includes new renewable energy projects and energy efficiency measures and initiatives made possible by funding under ab nine seven zero which was approved by the governor in september two zero zero zero californias electricity demand is growing at two percent per year to
