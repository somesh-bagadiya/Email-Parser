underground water supplies should be adequate since the plant will typically operate only a few hours a day even during the summer and winter peak demand periods environmentalists who have fought tvas nuclear and coal plants in the past are welcoming the switch to natural gas we support tva getting a larger share of generation from natural gas because it is a much cleaner source of fuel said dr steve smith executive director of the tennessee valley energy reform coalition a consumer and environmental advocacy group we would hope that tva will try to use these type of plants to replace some of the dirtier coal plants which are major sources of air pollution in the valley these shouldnt just be used to generate more and more power for tva to sell without any type of demand management strategy to also encourage consumers to use less electricity but tva officials insist the extra power is needed just to keep pace with rising power consumption in tvas seven state service territory electricity consumption in the valley already one of the highest regions in the country is growing twice as fast as the national average tva has signed option purchase agreements to buy power from other producers enron has even built three natural gasfired plants on the western edge of the tva territory the energy company built a four seven five megawatt peaking plant in brownsville tenn last year near where tva wants to build its newest plant last year enron also began operations on a four seven five megawatt plant in caledonia miss and a three nine zero megawatt plant in new albany miss we will continue to buy power when needed from other sources tva spokesman john moulton said but weve found that in the crunch times in the summer it is good to have your own power source a hearing on tvas new plant is scheduled in brownsville at five three zero pm tonight but because the new plant is located in a rural area and will generate only between one two and three zero permanent jobs it has not attracted much public comment yet mr carter said the environmental review is expected to be completed this summer and the plant should be in operation by june two zero zero one to see more of

blumenthal he was unaware of a tax advantage to enron to have the split however he is going to confer with others to verify perhaps there is an enron reason for the split which i am not aware of as for the parent guaranty issue will ge require an enron guaranty if the contract is to be assigned to the contractor and if not can the enron guaranty be replaced upon assignment thanks kay brian d

patriciagonzalezpsgecom karlsiverlingpsgecom williamdanaherpsgecom johnschroederpsgecom scottterhunepsgecom alfredograciansilvapsgecom subject enron monterreyvitro brian here are my comments on several items the consolidation agreement in one b thanks for reflecting the ge suggestion however near the end of the paragraph the word remedy should move to immediately after exclusive in eight the reference should be to paragraph one zero a not one one a in one zero a it does not look like the wording in my three zero mayzero zero email was picked up in one two and one three enron has added new wording since the preceding issuance of this document in one three is all of this wording necessary and applicable at the end of the first long sentence the word turnkey is used of course this is an equipment supply contract for ge also i believe the contracts do state what is in ge scope via clauses one two seven one eight six and three one so the last sentence is redundant more importantly these two clauses could be interpreted as establishing a gepsgeioc consortium this is something ge had advocated as the approach in a single contract for tax purposes in mexico ge can still go either way although the single document approach is more straightforward and that is what we initialed as a complete document in your offices last month enron wanted split contracts these clauses may undo what enron was attempting to achieve in this regard in one four which has been added by enron in the latest version of the consolidation agreement the ge entities seem to be prevented from getting an extension of time under one contract if there is a problem with performance under the other this is contrary to the words in the former enron clause five which has now been eliminated this clause one four should be removed regarding the swap payments for tax purposes to benefit both enron and ge the amount paid to date on the monterrey unit under the mou is two five one zero one seven three three what ge proposes it to revise the payment schedule for the contracts such that payments totaling this amount are due two three days after contract signing execute a separate letter to be signed at the same time as the contracts formally dissolving the mou the letter would call for ge to refund this same amount two three days after receipt of the payment under the contracts we need to draft this letter which will hopefully be one page the text of such a letter could include the following wording pursuant to clause three zero three of the now executed on and off shore contracts for this project the mou dated ______ is made null and void once the initial payments called for in said contracts have been made the monies in the amount of two five one zero one seven three three zero zero which were paid under the mou will be refunded to enron entity this would get the monies to the appropriate enron and ge entities in a related matter since the legal enron entity has changed ge

balanced schedule requirement this means that the rto should post the supply and demand curve with real time prices the best example at this time is pjms real time market a real time energy market is fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis it also provides the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission is needed getting a real time energy market would advance enrons ability to provide more financial tools to customers this market can be nodal or zonal in order to send location based price signals for example to ny city with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined proxy buses while kevin prefers the physical flowgate model with an option to collect congestion revenues rather than an obligation similar to the pjm ftrs now the method of determining the congestion management is secondary to the establishment of the real time energy market regulatory people should use their judgment and talk with the desk when determining how far to push optiontype flowgates rather than obligationtype ftrs such a physical market transmissioncongestion market can support a financial trading overlay if you do have an ftr type system there should be an upfront allocation to load ideally the load should have an network right from the generator to their load or from load to the hubs in order to have the ability to manage the congestion risk in the forward market when serving end use customers ees or for the ena full requirements deals the nodes should be grouped into logical zones and congestion within a zone should be uplifted this allocation to customers or full blown auction of all rights becomes critical in enrons ability to serve load and all requirements customers without the proper allocation not to incumbent utilties the risk premium to serve these customers becomes too high and cant be priced finally the market should have no price caps and preferably no icap market like nepool prefer pjms system where the load has to show the rto that it has contracted for enough reserves we have urged the ferc in florida to adopt a reserve monitoring system whereby customers are not penalized for lack of icap unless they actually go under the reserve requirement then they are required to purchase icap for a certain amount of time until they demonstrate continued compliance bottom line do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good congestion does not need to be perfectly allocated to each load if that mechanism is done in a manner that precludes enron and others from developing efficient real time energy markets that send a locational hourly price signal to the generation supply and the load demand this type of market will provide greater services to customers and allow enron to grow its business finally as we work toward this goal remember that in the absence of a realtime energy market we need to continue to focus our efforts on nondiscriminatory treatment with respect to transmission no native load exception and parking and lending scheduling flexibility etc,01:46:00,No

how loved and appreciated they are bits and thats one of those deeprooted fears that you just never want to deal with because we count on lisa to be the hallmark aspect of our grp and no one else i chalk it up to a frightening lack of estrogen amongst us alleither way not something i want to start thinking about bc its just opening pandoras box and cant stop still hoping to make it home on fri

exactly what ive been reminded of that feeling of uncertaintyloss of youthful bravado sadness injured sense of securityall of it everyone in the scott household is fine dad actually flew over ny yesterday morning before the first plane hit he was coming from manchester nh he said is was an absolutely beautiful day and that they flew right over central parkno idea how dramatically that skyline would change the first they heard of the events that they must have just missed was when they landed in nashville hes still in nashville right now obviously but hes okay and thats whats important im hoping with the limited flights theyre allowing that dad will be able to make it back to houston soon but it appears the faas just trying to get the passengers who are stranded back home so he may just be stuck somewhere else as a result chuck and chris were supposed to fly out tomorrow morning from seoul but they too have been delayed indefinitely the army has put a hold on all duty station transfers which means we have no idea when theyll be leaving korea or where exactly chuck will be going the stories and connections of the people on the news and those around me is horrifying and deeply saddening a large number of people we do business with are based in ny and have lost countless friends and colleagues in the wtcs destruction chuck has some pledge brothers who are working up there but weve heard that both of them are okay i wish you were back home as welli was on the phone with my mom off and on all day yesterday and i must say it wouldve been nice to been back home on the couch with her i did talk to jen yesterday worried about la and what was going on there but she was fine as well she said theyd shut down the airport and several major roads surrounding it but nothing else of concern we evacuated the enron building around nine three zero yesterday morningit was disconcerting i walked down the three two flights of stairs to get to my parking garage and had only one desireto get out of downtown there were rumors flying that houston was another target and given the size of our building our international presence esp in regards to oilnatural gas and our

energy future james flanigan zero five two zero two zero zero one los angeles times home edition cone copyright two zero zero one the times mirror company for all the debates about president bushs national energy policy the issues are more simple than complicated the most basic fact pushing the new policy is an energy department projection that us use of electricity will grow seven times faster in the next two decades than it has in the last one zero years and of necessity that growth will have to be satisfied with a different mix of fuels today five two of the nations electric power is generated by burning coal and one six comes from burning natural gas but natural gas is the growth element projected to supply three three of us electricity two zero years from now coal will continue to be the largest factor in electricity generation the bush plan states but its role will decline because of environmental considerations techniques already in usesuch as turning coal to gas before burningcan eliminate most of the polluting sulfur and nitrogen oxides but coals inefficient combustion generates high levels of carbon dioxide and accompanying concerns about global warming so its use will be in relative decline thats why the energy policy talks of increasing the use of nuclear power which supplies two zero of us electricity and thats also why the heart of the program supports exploration for natural gas and the building of pipelines to increase the availability of that efficient relatively clean fuel why is energy use projected to rise faster than it has in the recent past because the use of computer networks that today control the functioning of most institutions in societycompanies schools governmentis already increasing such networks demand electric power that is far more reliable than ever before and those demands have pushed the infrastructure of transmission lines and other facilities to the breaking point so a major thrust of the new policy is to support the modernizing of transmission systems and other infrastructure the plans very existence is positive business people say its an antidote to local bickering we now have a plan about energy expansion so a national dialogue can begin says mark stevens head of strategic planning for fluor corp a major engineering and construction company based in aliso viejo in orange county the new policy offers a stark contrast to the past during the last major energy crisis which began with the one nine seven three oil embargo government policy aimed to allocate scarce resources utilities were restricted from burning natural gas to produce electricity for example now the aim is to increase production of fuels and energy a sure consequence will be lower prices for oil and natural gas within a few years energy experts say from current levels of four to five per thousand cubic feet natural gas will be selling for three to four by two zero zero three says thomas robinson of cambridge energy research associates such price levels however still will be more than double those of most years in the last decade so the businesses of exploration production and delivery of natural gas will remain brisk current us consumption of natural gas is nearly two three trillion cubic feet a year up two one from a decade ago pushed by such demand industry is investing in major projectssuch as the natural gas pipeline from prudhoe bay in northern alaska down through canada on which design and engineering are underway oil field and gas service companies such as halliburton co and bj services co have been working flat out for more than a year companies that survived lean years when oil and natural gas prices were low such as global marine inc now are thriving under the bush proposals exploration for natural gas in the rocky mountains and other land areas would increase that would mean even more work for drilling and production companies such as helmerich payne inc noble affiliates inc and noble drilling corp which have been reaping higher sales and earnings after half a decade of lean times imports of natural gas will grow mexicos natural gas now being flared as it comes up with oil in the bay of campeche surely will find its way north to markets in the us and northern mexico either as liquefied natural gas or through pipelines that will be constructed a main thrust of the bush proposals will be to modernize and expand electric transmission lines and here again the new policy is focused on programs already underway the federal energy regulatory commission is working to set up new kinds of private companies called regional transmission organizations that would buy transmission lines from investorowned and municipal utilities and ultimately meld them into a national grid such rtos financed by institutional investors would increase the flow of electricity across the country and in theory eliminate bottlenecks that would enhance the growing practice of many utilities and companies such as enron corp of trading electricity in financial futures markets pge corp and sempra energy the holding companies for two of californias three big investorowned utilities operate large power trading businesses but legislation would be required to establish rtos and to acquire local transmission lines and that issue should lead to pitched battles in congress with its devotion to infrastructure the white house energy plan is certain to give increased work to engineering and construction companiesfluor bechtel group inc jacobs engineering group inc urs corp and washington group international incthat already have heavy backlogs well be hiring engineers says fluors stevensif he can find them the numbers of engineering graduates from us universities have been declining but as a result of opportunities presented by the bush energy program enrollments in engineering schools could increase or us companies could draw on engineering expertise at their subsidiaries in asia and europe where engineering graduates still are in abundance bushs energy plan if most of its proposals win approval in congress would serve as a catalyst for investment in electric power generation and oil and natural gas production as well as research on coal nuclear and to a lesser extent wind and solar power and other forms of renewable energy such investment always has a ripple effect on other industries even in the one nine seven zero s this brought surpluses and lower prices for energy which benefited companies in sectors as diverse as chemicals food processing and tourism

between regions industries and companies maneuvering to protect old advantages or carve out new ones with the help of powerful mentors on capitol hill according to congressional and industry officials the wide mix of players includes big coalburning utilities in the south and midwest companies that broker or sell power over the internet to the highest bidder huge public power providers such as tennessee valley authority rural and municipal cooperatives that enjoy grassroots political support dating to the new deal and others at the same time the debate between cleanerburning gas and dirtier coal the northeast vs the midwest and enron corp vs southern co could be as pivotal as the better publicized battle pitting environmentalists against advocates of more robust energy development thats what the congress is all about melding this all into a consensus package said rep joe barton rtex chairman of the house energy and commerce committee panel that will draw up legislation to restructure the industry that will be no easy task according to members of congress aides and officials of the electric utility industry although the electrical power industry agrees broadly on the need for more oil and gas exploration and new investments in transmission lines and pipelines crafting legislation is certain to bring out festering disagreements according to congressional officials there are divisions over environmental policy the pace of mergers and consolidation and the speed at which the country should move toward a national electricity grid in which the flow and price of power are determined by the laws of supply and demand the administrations proposal to give the federal government broader authority to dictate the location of transmission lines could set up clashes with governors and advocates of states rights none of that takes away from the indisputable influence of the nations power industry electrical utilities and their employees gave one eight nine million to political parties and candidates in the last election double the amount in one nine nine six bush received four four seven zero eight nine of this amount and barton and other members of the house and senate energy committees in both parties also collected hefty sums but whether the strong political connections will enhance chances for a broadbased energy bill this year or increase the likelihood of a stalemate between powerful but divergent interests is still unclear according to sources its a political hornets nest said a senior republican with close ties to the utility industry the bush plan for example holds out the possibility of regulatory relief for midwestern and southern coalburning utilities that have been sued by the environmental protection agency for allegedly violating air quality rules for old power plants the notion infuriates environmental groups and has been sharply attacked by democratic politicians rep edward markey dmass called the plan a trojan horse to take health and environmental laws passed in the last generation off the books the plan seems to favor the older and dirtier baseload coal plants in the southern and midwestern states said rebecca stanfield a lawyer with the us public interest research group but some of the strongest opposition to relaxing enforcement procedures comes from eastern utility companies that burn clean natural gas or have complied with stringent state environmental codes rep frank pallone jr dnj who serves on the environmental subcommittee of the energy and commerce committee charged that the bush plan would add to pollutants from midwest power plants being carried to the atlantic coast by easterly winds at the same time he said its wrong because you required utilities to meet more stringent standards and thats what they did its not fair regionally it doesnt have to be bloody but theres certainly going to be a fight he added the regional tensions are in play with the bush approach because it doesnt create a level business playing field said joseph miakisz of the clean energy group which represents eight eastern utilities without clear emission targets for key pollutants he said the bush reform will not solve the problem the bush administration plan sets out as a longterm objective a national grid for electricity in which prices would be determined by freemarket forces but coming on the heels of the california electricity crisis some politicallypowerful groups view such a deregulated system with renewed skepticism glenn english a former democratic congressman from oklahoma who is chief executive of the national rural electric cooperatives association said he could support a national grid but only if cooperatives and other consumers have a say in how it it is built and who is going to control it at the prodding of the federal energy regulatory commission utilities and states have begun setting up regional transmission organizations rtos to make decisions on the building of transmission lines and arbitrate between oldline utilities and new merchant companies that are vying to sell power over utilityowned lines the concern of english and others is that big conglomerates will end up controlling the rtos diluting the voice of smaller local groups without extensive consumer protections he said his organization also opposes a provision of the bush plan that would repeal a one nine three five law that makes it difficult for utility companies to acquire other utilities outside their home districts the issue pits cooperatives against many of the nations largest investorowned utilities which favor repeal of the public utility holding company act puhca among those who have lobbied for repeal is famed investor warren buffett whose berkshire hathaway co has a stake in midamerican energy holdings co but with memberowned rural cooperatives in four six states and more than half the four three five congressional districts englishs organization can count on a hearing for its views the public power people have to be factored in and will be before this is over said former democratic congressman vic fazio calif now a lobbyist for northwest senators from states with plentiful hydroelectric power the goal will be to preserve power systems that until the california crisis delivered a kilowatt hour of electricity for less than half what it costs in new england protecting northwestern electricity customers from price spikes resulting from power diversions to california could conflict with the drive for further deregulation and a more seamless

mirant which has participated in california and other states outside the south but southern co has been slow to open its regulated home markets in the southeast to penetration by enron and other

enforcement of environmental rules it calls for a review of epas pending lawsuit against southern and other companies charging they illegally modified coalburning power plants to avoid a review procedure that could have required costly investments in pollutioncontrol systems administration officials argue that rigid enforcement of environmental rules is thwarting a needed growth of coalfired power generation but whether the administration will ultimately prevail is uncertain several utilities have settled the epa lawsuit natural gas utilities which account for most of the new generating capacity added in the last decade have no interest in seeing environmental requirements relaxed for coalburning utilities that increasingly are their competitors for customers the environmental split is even more graphically illustrated in an internal industry dispute over the administrations opposition to including carbon dioxide a main culprit in global warming as part of a multipollutant solution to emissions by coalburning power plants southern supports the administration position though it says it favors useful fair measures to address greenhouse gas emissions but ohiobased american

pilot program scheduled to start next month is drawing far fewer residential electricity customers than the state hoped the participation rate across texas for individual consumers was just two one percent of its goal as of last week houstons rate was higher at four five percent but still short by thousands stakeholders in the deregulation process say no one should panic yet offering a variety of reasons for consumers slow embrace among them it takes time to persuade people to try something new people dont know about the pilot or are confused by the choices the sticker shock of airconditioningdriven summer bills has yet to arrive californias power woes the public is confused by the situation in california even though we have been trying to get the word out that their deregulation system is much different than the texas plan said texas sen david sibley rwaco coauthor of the states deregulation law the second reason is inertia you are asking people to take the time to shop around for a new provider and understand the program the pilot program marks a significant milestone in what is soon to be a huge change in the way texans think of electricity in one nine nine nine state lawmakers voted to open the market to competition with supporters saying deregulation would result in lower rates and improved service under deregulation houstonians will no longer be forced to buy power from reliant energy hlp instead other companies will compete for their business so far six new electric providers are offering service here with a variety of rates others are expected to enter the market no one will be forced to switch and those who dont will keep getting power from reliant before throwing the market open jan one the state has decided to let a limited number of residential and business customers buy from new companies all the players regulators the operator of the states power grid electric providers utilities can test computer systems and operating plans during the pilot originally those who signed up with new electric providers were to start getting service in early june last week the states power grid operator delayed the date to july six to give itself more time to change computer systems state officials had hoped five percent of residential customers of investorowned utilities would try new electric providers for the test customers can still sign up during the pilot program which ends when full deregulation starts of the residential slots the vast majority are for individuals and the rest for those who join powerbuying

customer counts marketing campaigns under way include mailers billboards and newspaper ads newpower co a partnership of houstonbased enron corp america online and ibm is mailing various offers to

as the texas crawfish festival the state is also doing an educational campaign including putting information on its web site at powertochooseorg consumers who want to switch must sort through various rate offers which can be confusing state officials recommend that they ask each provider for its electricity facts label which should provide applestoapples price comparisons texas is also battling against consumer identification with california the site of power blackouts and skyrocketing rates people hear the phrase electric deregulation and equate our plan with the california situation even though they are very different sibley said in addition to different deregulation systems texas has more than enough powergenerating capacity while california has a shortfall a number of new plants have been built in texas in recent years others are under construction and more are planned houstonians have been signing up for the deregulation pilot program at the highest rate in the state residents here probably know more about the subject houston tends to be a more energyaware city just because so many people work in the industry said brett perlman a puc commissioner from houston the reliant astrodome is also influencing some people last year reliant energy agreed to a three zero zero million namingrights deal for every building at the astrodome complex including the new football stadium when the deal was announced some reliant hlp customers were angry about the price tag as their rates increased the parent company defended the deal explaining that the money comes from a separate unregulated part of its business niewald at first choice power said a significant number of people have said the stadium deal motivated them to switch from reliant to his company separate slots were also reserved for commercial and industrial customers to participate in the pilot in many areas statewide a lottery was held because more than enough nonresidential customers signed up businesses make these kinds of decisions all the time whether it be coffee or copiers they will switch if there is economic value said tim vail newpowers vice president of energy technology solutions consumers have a different view much more of an emotional sale once full deregulation occurs the worstcase scenario would be that consumers refuse to sign up for new providers companies leave the residential marketplace and rates rise or dont fall because there is no competition but those involved with deregulation say the pilot participation rate is no reason for worry we really need a dozen people to make sure the system works said puc chairman pat wood once summer electricity bills start arriving in mailboxes he predicted consumers will be clamoring for a change ask me in august he said wood said he probably would be concerned if the goals of the residential pilot program havent been met in houston and dallas by the end of the year to janee briesemeister a senior policy analyst in the southwest region of consumers union the pilot participation rate does signal something it foretells that the market will be slow to develop for residential customers and residential customers will be slow to embrace it she said new power flow beginning this summer residential electricity users who have signed up with the states deregulation pilot program will be able to buy their electricity

the dpc to begin the termination proceedings enron had maintained a studied silence on the prospects of further talks with the renegotiating committee after the first meeting on may one one last the second meeting is scheduled for may two three and enron is yet to decide on attending it in a statement the dpc blamed the unwillingness of the mseb and the maharashtra government to honour their offtake commitments and that of the centre to assist the state but kept its options of renegotiations open as a final note even though it was necessary to issue the ptn we are still open to constructive discussion on solutions the statement said it suggested that a solution could be either the mseb buying the power according to the contract or finding another creditworthy buyer with this the company which was supposed to come out with its own proposal in the wake of the godbole committee finding errors of omissions and commissions in the ppa is now putting the onus on the mseb the maharashtra and the central governments and that too within the framework of the existing ppa while blaming the indian side for the ptn the dpcsaid this would continue and expected the buyers to meet

new delhi may one nine though there was no official comment on the enron promoted dabhol power company issuing the pretermination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board mseb the central government seems to be in a mood to wash its hands off the controversial project highlyplaced sources in the power ministry had indicated to the hindu recently that the centre would not be unduly perturbed in case enron walked out of the project this thinking was backed by some action also after agreeing on april two three to constitute a re negotiating committee in which it would also have a nominee and more importantly agreeing to consider wheeling the excess power from the dpc out of the state the centre quietly went back on its word first it did not send its representative to the first meeting of the renegotiating committee on may one one even though the meeting date was announced in advance secondly it reportedly indicated to maharashtra that bailing out the project by taking the high cost excess power out of the state would not be feasible in the absence of this facility there was little the renegotiating committee could do to salvage the project in fact while announcing the formation of the re negotiating committee on april two three the finance minister mr yashwant sinha clearly indicated that the renegotiation would focus on two issues the cost of power and use of power elaborating on the second point he had said use of power would mean an assessment of how much power would be absorbed by the state and how much would have to be taken out for the centre the financial liability in case of termination is not likely to be a big burden as per the agreement the liability of the centre is limited to payment of one years electricity bill with an overall ceiling of rs one five zero zero crores subject to suitable adjustments on account of inflation and a termination fee which would be three zero zero million at the maximum but even here in case the centre pays the money on account of its counterguarantee to the project a tripartite agreement is in place among the centre the state government and the reserve bank under which the centre can recover from the state any amount paid to the dpc under the counterguarantee hence the final liability would be on the state and not the centre which would basically be extending a deferred loan to maharashtra to be recovered in stages sources in the power industry here say a thinking has probably crystallised among the top officials at the centre as well as in the state that the entire power purchase agreement with the dpc is faulty and the project cannot continue on the basis of the existing agreement in these circumstances the dpcs pretermination notice is seen as being advantageous for the country since it would amount to one of the partners walking out of a project thereby weakening enrons case for higher compensation the indian position would be that it had offered a renegotiating committee in an attempt to make the project viable but it was enron which was withdrawing the claims of enron could then be pitched against the penalty notices issued by the mseb to the dpc for

without a losstwo zero zero nine zero nine two zero zero nine zero nine zero nine longhorn q atwo zero zero nine q judging from the stanford game as well as the last three games of l asttwo zero season it looks like the trend of blitzing the horns will continue there istwo zero also no respect for our running game from any team that we face i think th etwo zero best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor ontwo zero offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving two zero us two zero zero nine zero nine in order for us to achieve this i think it starts with us putting our b esttwo zero athletes on the field on offense these guys may not be the most experience dtwo zero players but they will gain experience with playing time and they have the two zero ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz its time to sta rttwo zero roy williams and bj johnson at receiver along with montrell flowers and two zero play a oneback offensive set our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a ndtwo zero hodges mitchell is not an iback who is adept at following the fullbacktwo zero through the hole hodges strength is operating in space and making people two zero miss in the open fieldtwo zero zero nine zero nine i also think chris simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter backtwo zero major applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but simms could and two zero probably does possess all of the same skills he just hasnt had the chanc etwo zero to display them we desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if two zero we are going to turn this thing around if not i could see this seasontwo zero slipping to seven four real quick what are your thoughts chiptwo zero zero nine the jackson residencetwo zero zero nine zero nine brown with any unexpected loss the tendency is to throw everyone out two zero change coaches players even the bus driver you do that and you are telli ngtwo zero this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them there cant be to otwo zero much change at any one time the big question is how the team responds to two zero this stanford loss emotionally something tells me if texas can find some two zero resolve and perform really well youll see some solid performances at all two zero the positions where problems currently exist in one nine nine six texas was no six and two zero notre dame was no nine texas had the game won in austin and then lost ut th entwo zero lost three of its next four which included games against oklahoma state two zero oklahoma and colorado all teams texas is about to face after this weeks two zero opponent houstontwo zero zero nine zero nine that was a different coach and different players but the common thread wastwo zero that texas hit the top one zero and then choked if texas is hung over from its two zero loss to stanford trouble could be on the horizon if texas can find resolv etwo zero to show everyone that stanford truly was a game in which everything thattwo zero could go wrong did then i think the longhorns will bounce back and be a ha rdtwo zero team to beat the rest of the way tuesday night mack brown said the longhor nstwo zero are not a very good football team right now the challenge has been made to two zero his team if they come out and stink against houston every position will b etwo zero scrutinized every coach even the bus driver there will be enough firetwo zero being thrown in austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state bu ttwo zero changes will have to be made constructively and graduallytwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine imagetwo zero zero nine chris simms two zero zero nine zero nine q whats going on with the quarterbackstwo zero zero nine mitch goldingtwo zero zero nine zero nine brown as the qbs turn this week it appears chris simms will start two zero because he was practicing with the first team on tuesday that has been the two zero trend whoever practices with the first team gets the start anyway well two zero see how they respond after the stanford game major applewhite was erratic intwo zero his play despite almost leading the longhorns back from the dead to atwo zero miraculous victory im sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see two zero what simms can do against houston before picking one or the other two zero zero nine zero nine to get solo duty in the oklahoma and colorado games two zero zero nine zero nine granted if one struggles along the way the other will come in but mac ktwo zero brown said they primarily went with applewhite against stanford because of two zero his experience and the fact that it was the teams first game on the road hetwo zero said they still have all the faith in the world in simms it would seem to metwo zero that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense lig httwo zero it up and get on a roll when you are alternating but ill continue to watc htwo zero like everyone else two zero zero nine zero nine i keep trying to remind myself that brown did this twice at north caroli natwo zero with success of course with those qbs oscar davenport and chris keldorf two zero brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t otwo zero prepare for davenports scrambling and keldorfs passing with simms andtwo zero applewhite you pretty much get the same style with keldorf and davenport two zero you also had injuries dictate a few startstwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q can you tell us what influenced mack browns decision regarding the two zero quarterbacks against stanfordtwo zero zero nine nels marshalltwo zero zero nine zero nine brown here are browns exact words experience we were in a tight two zero football game and major applewhite has been around a long time i was pro udtwo zero even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter that wetwo zero didnt panic i thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job two zero of coming back and giving us a chance to win sometimes youth doesnt look two zero like it is trying because theyre nervous instead they are trying too har dtwo zero and get uptight our team tried hard as negative as people make saturday two zero night it is one of those things that you have to grow from two zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q im glad we have two great qbs my question is are the receivers ha vingtwo zero any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from atwo zero lefthanded or righthanded qbtwo zero zero nine dave stastny austintwo zero zero nine zero nine brown the receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch ingtwo zero the ball they do however say that chris simms ball will come a little two zero faster and a little harder than major applewhitestwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q the longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea rtwo zero what are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts i know two zero that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons but can they al sotwo zero apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount oftwo zero time two zero zero nine chad grahamtwo zero zero nine zero nine brown no once a freshman plays in a game even for one play and he d oestwo zero not suffer a seasonending injury the chance for a redshirt is out thetwo zero window two zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine imagetwo zero zero nine jermain anderson two zero zero nine zero nine q have the coaches given any consideration to moving jermain anderson b acktwo zero to linebacker if i remember correctly he played lb in high school at texa stwo zero city he seems to still have good speed but also a problem putting on the two zero necessary weight to play defensive end it just seems like he might be bett ertwo zero suited for the outside linebacker rotation especially considering thetwo zero progress made by young defensive ends like kalen thornton cole pittman and two zero adam doiron two zero zero nine micah hurttwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine brown coaches dont think anderson has the speed to play linebacker theytwo zero are pleased with the depth at linebacker as well they like andersonstwo zero instincts as a pass rusher they are still working on his ability to stop t hetwo zero runtwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q my husband

nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine imagetwo zero zero nine hodges mitchell two zero zero nine zero nine q dont know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y ourtwo zero column but ive seen some unflattering trends in mack browns program and two zero wanted your feedback mack brown is a great recruiter no argument there two zero however can he motivate it seems like he cant get the team up sometime stwo zero and cant adjust the teams mood during a gametwo zero zero nine zero nine about offensive coordinator greg davis i dont know who is responsible fortwo zero the offensive line but since it is an offensive group in more ways than on etwo zero i put it under him with guys the size that ut has shouldnt even hodges two zero mitchell be able to run who tagged leonard davis as a pro why does davis two zero love mitchell sure he gained one three zero zero plus yards last year but how many of two zero those yards were movetwo zero zero nine zero nine the chains type of runs that allowed ut to hold the ball on the ground andtwo zero protect a lead i thought it was going to be running back by committee but two zero all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake abandoning th etwo zero run and using the wrong back for the wrong situationstwo zero zero nine zero nine mitchell can run to the outside but he cannot run through the defensive two zero tackles and even if he does get holes he still will never break through t hetwo zero linebackers for a td why not put ivan williams or kenny hayter back there two zero with mitchell and go with a twoback threewide offense you dont lose a two zero receiver as hodges is a nice smart receiver zero nine zero nine other ramblings is quentin jammer really a corner he got beat many tim etwo zero against stanford i loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury two zero may have forever changed his game if he cant play safety and cant keep up two zero with opponents wideouts zero nine zero nine how is the defensive end position shaping up the defensive tackles were alltwo zero over the field against stanford but the des didnt make much noise what i stwo zero up with the blocked punts ut should be really really embarrassed doestwo zero stockton take too long is he too close to the line can the line block ca ntwo zero anyone at ut block zero nine zero nine does brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls several tim estwo zero the camera caught clear holds by stanfords line why on earth would you ru ntwo zero up the middle on your own goal line against two of the best dts youll pla ytwo zero againsttwo zero zero nine andrew bowentwo zero zero nine zero nine brown i think your feelings are shared by many texas fans who aretwo zero incredibly pained shocked disappointed angered and hurt by last saturday stwo zero events but in talking to mack brown on tuesday he said its fair to beat two zero the team up for not being able to run the ball but he said to jump on any two zero other part of the team is to rip young inexperienced kids who are stilltwo zero learning what it takes to compete as a topranked teamtwo zero zero nine zero nine to be fair to brown he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a ndtwo zero needed time to grow into some key positions receiver defensive endtwo zero fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner it probabl ytwo zero isnt fair to question whether mack brown can motivate because his teams di dtwo zero beat nebraska twice oklahoma twice and texas azero two once if a trend develop stwo zero and texas falls apart the rest of the season there will be a fair question two zero about whether brown did a good enough job of keeping his teams head screwe dtwo zero on straight but its typical after losses to want to shred every part of t hetwo zero teamtwo zero zero nine zero nine brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong the two zero quarterback situation would be blamed and he was right the qbs are still two zero working hard and look for simms to start this week against houston there stwo zero no question that the oline is struggling but so are the backs and so are two zero the receivers brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the two zero line he said the other three were caused by miscommunication betweentwo zero applewhite and the receivers causing applewhite to hold the ball too long two zero zero nine zero nine mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against stanford so it wastwo zero taking him too long to get to the holes the coaches were not happy about two zero that they were yelling at him to move up he should only be six one two yardstwo zero deep but he was sometimes at nine yards mitchell also struggled with sometwo zero blitz pickup which is uncharacteristic of him so look for victor iketwo zero hayter and possibly williams to get a little time against houstontwo zero zero nine zero nine coaches are still high on jammer again he hasnt played corner much in two zero games after moving from safety but coaches are not thinking of moving him two zero the defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator carl two zero reese he is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl etwo zero who can really play cory redding was better than usual against stanford b uttwo zero that position still needs a lot of work the blocked punt occurred because two zero one player who blocked perfectly on one one other punts saturday night failed totwo zero block a player coming right up the middle which guarantees doom that play ertwo zero has been chewed out every which way zero nine zero nine as far as the penalties there were several questionable calls but brow ntwo zero who did a lot of yelling at officials during the stanford game couldnt sa ytwo zero anything about it after the game because he would be fined texas can still two zero have a good season and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so two zero early will help in that direction well see if texas takes this losstwo zero constructively or destructivelytwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q last year at times i saw blazing speed and ability from cory redding itwo zero know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player intwo zero the country in one nine nine eight ive waited all offseason to see him explode against two zero teams this year i havent seen it yet maybe this week against stanford m ytwo zero question is why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker two zero where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized two zero and average is texas that low on defensive line talent it seems ourtwo zero recruiting has been great please help me understand hook em hornstwo zero zero nine ernie mcanallytwo zero zero nine zero nine brown redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov etwo zero but he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel dtwo zero right away as a defensive end coaches also feel that his body six five two six zero i stwo zero perfect for the de position hes tall athletic fast and has long arms i ntwo zero time coaches feel redding will develop into an allamerica player but the retwo zero is no question that he has struggled against the run he made some big play stwo zero against stanford recording six tackles three of them for losses andtwo zero blocking an extra point attempt he is just a sophomore over this season a ndtwo zero the next two years he should only get bettertwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine q i was watching the regional telecast of the tcu game today and the two zero announcers stated that tcu had anted up nine zero zero zero zero for the heisman campaign f ortwo zero ladainian tomlinson how much did ut spend on its campaign for rickytwo zero williams run for the heismantwo zero zero nine zero nine brown texas didnt spend that much money at all they produced a few two zero postcards a video and a cdrom screen saver to send out to the nationaltwo zero media detailing rickys accomplishments but those costs totaled less than two zero one zero zero zero zero according to ut officialstwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q did any of the freshman who did not play in the louisianalafayette gametwo zero play in the stanford game i am watching to see which ones might betwo zero redshirts two zero zero nine mike smith houstontwo zero zero nine zero nine brown according to the participation chart provided at the stanfordt exastwo zero game austin sendlein was the only freshman to play against the cardinal wh otwo zero did not play against louisianalafayette in addition to sendlein here are two zero the other freshmen who have played so far wrs roy williams bj johnson a ndtwo zero sloan thomas te brock edwards de kalen thornton cb nathan vasher fstwo zero phillip geiggar and dt stevie leetwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q is it true that in mack browns four or five head coaching stops hi stwo zero teams have yet to win a single conference championship since ut has lost two zero four out of its last five games wouldnt a loss to houston this weektwo zero officially end mack browns honeymoon with the alumni notwithstanding his two zero abundant pr program with brown about to land his third national top five two zero recruiting class i believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie stwo zero to go with those recruiting victories two zero zero nine t houghtwo zero zero nine zero nine brown its true that brown has yet to win a conference championship i ntwo zero stints at appalachian state tulane north carolina and now texas attwo zero appalachian state tulane and unc he was taking over absolutely deadtwo zero programs he took tulane to a bowl and he had florida state to deal with i ntwo zero the atlantic coast conference while at unc but he took unc to six bowl gam estwo zero in his one zero years at unc and won four of themtwo zero zero nine zero nine a loss to houston would certainly intensify the frustration of texastwo zero faithful but i think anyone who would be looking to put brown on the hot two zero seat or rip him if texas lost to houston would be overlooking the job he ha stwo zero done beating nebraska twice oklahoma twice and texas azero two once in hi stwo zero first two seasons here he has also turned texas back into a destinationtwo zero school for top recruits and brought the ut community back together intwo zero addition to all that he has done more good for ut out of the limelight tha ntwo zero probably most texas fans realizetwo zero zero nine zero nine brown is now in the same spotlight as bobby bowden john cooper lloyd c arrtwo zero steve spurrier and phil fulmer any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t hetwo zero eyes of fans it may take some time for brown and his team to adjust to tha ttwo zero unc fans were pretty hohum about everything the tar heels did in football two zero even when they won big brown wanted to win at a school with hugetwo zero expectations hell have to adjust now that it appears texas will be starti ngtwo zero out the next few seasons in the top one zero two zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q is lee jackson out for the houston gametwo zero zero nine marty bonnertwo zero zero nine zero nine brown jackson is out for the houston game with a hamstring pull suffe redtwo zero against stanford he may also miss the oklahoma state game mack brown said two zero this is a bad week to be without jackson because houston can throw the ball two zero really welltwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q is ricky williams jersey being retired at the oklahoma state game s epttwo zero three zero two zero zero nine mark wilsontwo zero zero nine zero nine brown yes williams no three four will be retired at that game williams ha stwo zero said he will be there because the new orleans saints are off that weekend two zero host communications has also just finished a video biography on williams th attwo zero will be available soontwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q what did mack brown say about the expectations surrounding his team aftertwo zero the loss to stanfordtwo zero zero nine virginia blairtwo zero zero nine zero nine brown again here are macks words i said during the preseason tha t wetwo zero were overrated i didnt see any reason with the youth the way we finished two zero last year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a two zero top five football team one of the great things about texas is that you receiv etwo zero a tremendous amount of attention and publicity but in some cases people wa nttwo zero to push you too fast to get to the top i think that we were in that positi ontwo zero and expectations got out of hand i knew that we would have a difficult gam etwo zero at stanford and that it would be a tough game to win i also didnt think two zero that we deserved to be ranked fifth in the country our current rank within two zero the top one five is much more fitting for where we are today two zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine if you received this newsletter from a friend and would

for the next one zero years the company has four hotels in california three of which buy their power from sdge sources close to the matter said enron has contracted to sell the hotel power at about six cents per kilowatthour compared with the two two five centskwh starwood said it was charged by sdge in august neither company would disclose the terms of the deal but starwood said it expects to reduce its energy costs by more than two zero zero million over the next one zero years enron the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the us will purchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its experience to manage the risks while paying a fee to utilities like sdge for use of their distribution networks that really is our core strength said harold buchanan chief operating officer for enron energy services north america we understand how to manage those risks high rates driving industrial customers cities to switch the growing interest in fixedprice supply contracts is fueling a comeback of sorts for enron the houstonbased company had tried to break into californias retail power market just after deregulation even spending nearly one million to advertise the venture during the super bowl but enron gave up trying to win residential customers in one nine nine eight citing disappointing response and lowerthanexpected profits that was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of promise oddly enough now that deregulation is coming under attack in california soaring power prices are building demand for enrons services the company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in san diego that have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are interested in signing longterm fixedrate contracts buchanan said overall what enron can provide is reliability pricing in san diego thats written in stone buchanan said its far cheaper than what theyre paying now with the utilities a number of large industrial customers negotiating with enron declined to comment the city of roseville near sacramento entered into a one one four million contract with enron last month to purchase five zero megawatts of electricity for five years at four nine per megawatthour furthermore the city has started talks with enron about building and operating a seven five zero megawatt natural gasfired power plant that city officials expect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity mayor harry crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price spikes that have plagued customers of sdge since june san marcos in san diego county is proposing to switch electricity service for its one zero zero zero zero residents to enron from sdge a move the city council said could shave about one two million a year off the citys power bill enron has said it would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered roseville an sdge spokesman said last week that the utility supports such arrangements saying theyre one way deregulation is supposed to work enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to sdge itself for four years at a fixed rate of five five centskwh but the utility said the price was too high california gov gray davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap electricity rates for sdges customers at six five centskwh by jason leopold dow jones newswires three two

subject to cpuc investigation pfour four two socal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized firm rp capacity i dont see any negative impact on tw perhaps positive pfour five three price cap for secondary intrastate market set at one two zero of socal firm rate this is the same cap that applies to socal i dont like the precedent set in this area however it assures that the economic value allocation between socal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the interstate system providers in any tight transportsupply scenario pfour six four not really a change but bilas mentions support for hector rd as a deliveryreceipt at ferc five pd does not reduce the cores interstate capacity nor their storage capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels current level one zero four four mmcfd proposed one zero zero zero mmcfd on the interstate system and current storage seven zero bcf three two seven mmcfd of injection and one nine three five mmcfd withdrawal vs proposed five five bcf i see no clear negative impact on tw from this changep five two five four six ctas core transport agents allowed to reject only their prorata share of nonreliability storage service no impact on tw interests p five eight seven socal directed to presentvia advice ltr how the cost of noncore default balancing will be allocated only to those noncore customer using this service and not to the core customers i see no impact on tw psix two eight pd rejects the requirement that socalsdge file an application with a proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider i see only positive attributes of this change for tw psix three nine preserves the right for socalsdge to seek recovery of expenditures associated with the transfers of customers from core to core aggregator no impact on tw psix six one zero pd orders a one zero cap on itcs stranded costresponsibility borne by bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity no direct impact upon tw interest however likely a touchy point with noncore interest p seven five one one pd orders that the core contribution to noncore itcs will end effective the adoption of the pd additionally noncore customers to pay five zero of core itcs till the end of the core tw and epng agreements no negative impact on tw noncore customers bear additional expense the pd estimates an additional one eight million over next five to six years p seven eight the pd provides an estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between zero one and zero six to be approx four four four million one two pd say no to an increase in the core brokerage fee of zero zero zero three nine to two four cents no impact on tw interest peight three one three pd treats core subscription service differently on an accounting basis no impact on tw peight five eight seven one four generally the pd makes some administrative changes to the small coreesp market rules and socal services and consumer protection implementation no impact on tw interest p eight eight one zero zero one five lots of tweaking on how socal can recover the cost to implement to services envisioned under the csa owing to the fact that socal has already started to implement portions of the csa and those cost are accruing to a balancing account etc bottomline not consequential to the approval of the pd no direct impact upon tw interest p one zero three one one zero on whole the centerpiece of tws interest in this proceeding remains intact the socal receipt points are unbundled along with socal backbone facilities tw has primary firm rp of no less than seven five zero mmfcd mojave is recognized at only five zero mmfcd firm rp no receipt point complex is given a preference for capacity expansion line two three five appears to remain useful for tw deliveries into the market load centers the pd modifications to the csa do not impose upon tw any conditions or costs that would be reason not to support the pd the parties most affected by the pd are the core aggregators with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore customers with additional cost allocations points for comments one tw agrees with the pd that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied in the csa in the creation of firm tradable rp rights this change in socal market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to build long term supply and transportation contracts two further adoption of the pd substantially reduces unnecessary market inefficiencies at the california border by providing all market participants with gas scheduling certainty three the creation of tradable secondary rights on socals intrastate system will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices four the pd correctly observes that the pge market structure which relieves upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work relatively well during californias challenging energy markets five tw agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the pd the energy markets in california have been improving and stabilizing the commission promising options are still valid in todays gas market further socal is already starting to follow the csa game plan in their attempts to improve the operating environment on the socal system it is consistent to follow through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these improvements six tw supports socal and others whom are approving this pd on this point tw should be sure that socal is on board as well as other csa signatories prior to filing these type comments i look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call mark igs mark igs,06:36:25,No

mumford mike kirkpatrick eric brent richard parsons ben albanis george subject re db contact names irisamitava i may have already said this but weve had so many emails and telephone calls flying back and forth that i wanted to make sure i at least got this much out to you clearly i would like you to set up the meeting with the riskcalc gurus to dig deeper into their methodology as much as theyll tell and the impact of missing variables and any other idiosyncracies the model may have also try to get a better feel for how well they think the model extends to other countries i know from a previous conversation with lea carty and reading about the model that it was calibrated off north american names but they suspect it might extend to other countries conversely i know they are working efforts within moodys risk management services to develop private and probably public firm models specific to regions one they mentioned was australia and also within western europe data as always was the issue see if the quants have any perspective on their successplan in that area lastly we truly appreciate the aggressive efforts you both have made toward pushing off this private model initiative

would be looking at one seven vs one two fields i know riskcalc requires one seven inputs and seem to apply that the model does not work for less than one seven yesterday the riskcalc sales people could not guarantte that their model would work for less than the required one seven data inputs they suggested that this would be a question to direct towards their quants who developed the model

iris thanks after our meeting we stuck around to discuss things a little further specifically with respect to global counterparty names we have duns crossreferences on about seven zero of active names one three k out of one eight five k we could greatly accellerate purchase of some useful data by buying blind all major data associated with these specific duns numbers pro data gets in on names we know we want to review asap but without resolution on which specific fields are most useful we also get to test for completeness of data how many have all one seven fields how many have only one two of which fields etc con costs could be significantly higher buying info we dont know we need converse of buying only the one seven fields doesnt seem best answer we would end up buying additional info later overhead costs and piecemeal buying will increase costs it development time would be greatly increased multiple file formats developing to unknown maximum size etc redoing when more data is

hoped therefore it is not certain that the euro will be a stable hard currency area moreover the report highlighted the latent t hreat of diverging national growth dynamics within the union this brings to mind germanys dilemma of needing a boost from either lower interest rat es or higher fiscal spending but the european central bank has been unwill ing to lower rates below three two five for fear of stoking inflation meanwhile th e european union government would like to censure germany for irresponsible spending which is pushing their debt levels close to the three of gdp limit s et out in the maastrict treaty further weighing on the euro was german c hancellor schroeders remark today that his government has not come up with a list of spending cuts or tax hikes to reign in germanys budget deficit german states do not want to reduce spending and this now compromises fin min eichels promise to the eu that the government would bring the budget c lose to balance by two zero zero four which was part of the compromise under which germa ny avoided an embarrassing censure from the eu this month for its rising de ficit this also suggests that there is no way eichels promise can be met and that they may indeed face a fine from the eu this year if their growth projections are too high and revenue therefore too low which would push th e deficit to gdp ratio above the three limit

group,the model is supposed to be a real option model to capture the value of power plants of gencos it is to give trader a better insight as to whether the market is overvaluingundervaluing certain genco stocks and trader can act accordingly im still trying to find out how trader is supposed to use it modeling details the model takes in all gencos locational power forward prices and fuel forward prices and uses garch model to simulate one year daily prices and then uses a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices garch model parameters are estimated by the consultant using and separate model and are updated twice a year and it does not matter whether the simulation starts in january or september using these prices it will determine whether a unit at a particular location will be dispatched or not depending on a spread of power and fuel prices and b whether the startup cost can be recovered during eight operation hours the unit can be dispatched at minimum and peak levels fixed om sox and nox i dont know what the last two stand for are taken into consideration with the simulated dispatch schedule the model calculates the value that can be generated by this unit then sums it up across all units the final value is the average of one zero zero simulations and it takes about one six hours to run for about two zero zero units after our conversation the consultant promised to look into a how to make the model more flexible say to allow a different time horizon b reduce spreadsheet overhead by doing calculation one unit a time and not saving all the intermediate information as of now it saves everything on the spreadsheet assuming the garch process is modelled correctly i believe the methodology is ok though it does not capture most of the optionality my concerns are whether the price processes are modelled correctly i have to get more details before making any conclusion one zero zero simulations are way too few unless we convert the algorithm to c i dont see how spreadsheet can handle more simulations i guess thats why they contact us but again if enrons buying the model from the consulting company why should enron do their job for them how traders going to use the model output for this i phoned jeff the associate who initiated all these and am still waiting for his returning call a related questions why the model horizon is one year we can either oversee the conversation but not doing actual coding for them or redo the model for them the problem still remains that how traders going to use the output but in view of the great wall of china separating the business units should we do it as of now i have a simulation model taking startup cost fixed om rumpup delay into consideration it simulates monthly prices using gbm and takes two minutes four zero seconds to run one zero zero zero zero simulations for one unit for ten years one two zero time steps it can use forwardforward vol and incorporate seasonality into it i understand this is debatable one interesting observation is that when using forwardforward vol simulation the standard deviation is about zero five while standard deviation using forward vol is about two also incorporating seasonality increases the value by about one six since most of the timecost occurs in price simulation and we are to simulate about two zero price processes i hope the full model if we build it will take a couple of hours to run for two zero zero units the main task will be interfacing ie getting data from data base and outputting the results this is where i need most help if i am

president california public utilities commission june one zero two zero zero one lynch was appointed march two two two zero zero zero previously she was director of gov gray davis office of planning and research question what is this summer going to be like in terms of blackouts what is the economic impact going to be answer i dont think anybody can predict they are wild guesses or at least estimates based on assumptions that we dont know three factors influence the level of blackouts one is how hot its going to be the second is conservation and whether folks will really step up to the plate both business and residences and conserve their hearts out and load shift to nonpeak times we reduced the load eight to nine percent in march and april and slightly more one one percent in may were going to have to do better than that to avoid blackouts the third factor is making sure that the generation that can run does run and right now were doing an abysmal job of that we have record levels of unplanned outages at generating plants this week one zero zero zero zero megawatts were out of three five zero zero zero megawatts four two zero zero zero megawatts including municipal utilities in state capacity historically there has only been three zero zero zero to four zero zero zero megawatts off at any one time does the puc have no control over when utilities take a plant off line utilities yes private generators no since november the unplanned outages have been three four times what history would show over a two zero year period exactly what explains that is the heart of one of our investigations what can the puc do about it we have been in the plants since midjanuary in january we had two five days of stage two alerts two days of stage three in three one days we started going in those plants although weve had lots of difficulty getting into plants on time and most importantly getting the operations and maintenance logs why dont you get an injunction from a judge to tell the private companies they have to give the puc everything it wants frankly because in this last one zero zero day period i was trying to not be that aggressive i was trying to work it out with these generators and we have made significant movement with some of those generators is it illegal for a privately owned power company to shut down in order to drive up prices isnt that the multibillion dollar question thats where you match you legal theories is the puc joining in any of these legal actions against ferc and the private power generators you know we actually asked for help from ferc in getting data from generators because ferc has wide access to all sorts of market data i talked to former chairman james hoecker directly in september he said no problem you just send us your data request and well make sure they comply but we had no informal help from the ferc and so we filed a motion in november i believe for ferc to compel those people under its jurisdiction to give us basic documents ferc has yet to move on those motions to compel is the puc is joining in any of the civil actions at this point we havent joined in the private civil lawsuits what else can the puc do well theres a ton of stuff that the puc does in front of ferc we appear on electricity and natural gas issues and we continue to file formal complaints to that administrative agency for instance it was the puc that brought the complaint at ferc against el paso corp three weeks after i became president of the puc we complained about anticompetitive activity we have brought all the motions at ferc to prevent the generators from reupping their market price authority if ferc does nothing and allows this marketbased rate authority to continue what would you do california is experiencing the real time consequences of justice delayed is justice denied eventually the administrative procedure act would allow us to go to court but frankly a variety of utilities and other folks have been trying to kick it up to either the dc circuit or the nine th circuit preliminary responses from the courts have been that they have failed to exhaust administrative remedies whats in store for san diego in terms of price hikes bottom line its unrealistic to think that san diego can continue to be charged in the six to seven cent range when everybody else now is being charged in the one zero to one one cent range but i cant prejudge the level because were just starting to hear the evidence how do you think the escrow accounts our individual charge accounts with sdge are going to shake down eventually frankly thats an issue thats also before the commission what the legislation clearly says is that theres this balancing account that san diego is billing things into as a regulatory accounting matter but thats not the end of the inquiry they put the money in and they charge it to a regulatory account and then they come to the puc then the puc judges the reasonableness of those charges and the separate watch dog component of the puc the office of ratepayer advocates has done some preliminary analysis on sdges charges up through i believe august of two zero zero zero and has questioned a large percentage of those charges as unreasonable because of sdges failure to hedge when they had hedging opportunities utility executives criticize the puc on two major counts they say only half the utility plants had to be divested but the puc set the rate of return and other restrictions in such a fashion that it really encouraged utilities to dispose of the other half second they say that when the puc eventually allowed them to enter longterm contracts it did not spell out procedures in case the contracts turned out to be unfortunate moves how would you respond the first part wasnt on my watch in terms of the rate of return that was set by the prior puc however on that question of rate of return and five zero percent versus more i think sdge is a little separately situated because i do think there were some encouragement of sdge selling off in order to be able to merge the rate of return may have been lower than the utilities wanted and the criticism about longterm contracts i think the longterm contract issue has been painted in simplistic terms and its not a simplistic question when the utilities came to the commission in two zero zero zero seeking permission the commission acted faster than it usually acts on july two one of last year pge and edison came to the commission and said they wanted authority to enter into direct bilateral contracts by aug three we said yes but they claim that you did not give them the ground rules oh we certainly did we applied the historic reasonableness test but they wanted an upfront guarantee that they would not be secondguessed and my concern on that was heightened because they have all these unregulated subsidiaries because theyre now energy trading in the market the facts are they did enter contracts and we can show you the contracts they entered into in august september october and november of last year when californias deregulation law was being shaped why was nobody concerned about abuse of market power by the private generating companies it is truly astonishing and i believe its because of an ideological bias from my predecessors who said well we will have a flood of competition into this market because its just a commodity but in fact this commodity is uniquely situated to not have a flood of competition because you have high capital barriers to entry you have long lead times to increase supply its a fundamental economic necessity which cant be stored and you cant choose not to buy it theres no effective substitute other states such as texas and pennsylvania appear to be doing deregulation right do you believe it can be done right i think the jurys out on that question texas started from a position of supply and is energy independent and does not report to the ferc in terms of its own intrastate transmission grid pennsylvania already had an integrated utility sharing relationship with other states the utilities had buyback contracts with the plants that they sold so that they got longterm contracts at the time of sale the utilities also sold a much smaller percentage of their plants i say california went the farthest fastest with the least amount of safeguards in retrospect what was the central flaw in this deregulation plan the central flaw was not to realize the market power would be exercised by the sellers of a fundamental economic necessity for which there is no effective substitute in the current argument over temporary price caps the bush administration says this might diminish shortterm pain but in the long term would discourage new supply whats your reaction to that my reaction is price caps or costbased pricing is an absolute economic necessity for california the market is broken regardless of who broke it and how it broke its broken maybe irrevocably until we can make a market work here we must have some protection for our economy we really are going back a hundred years and reaching back these companies are recreating the kinds of trust that led to trust busting the economy cant withstand this and in terms of the supply argument yeah supply is a state issue gov davis is streamlining and we have all these plants being built and plus we are conserving like never before we have supply coming on line its being built its not being abandoned and if it were abandoned in the unlikely event the people that sunk in hundreds of millions of dollars into an investment decided to walk and abandon their investment which isnt rational economic behavior then the utilities could take those over and build it at costbased building or the power authority or whoever most of those plants entered the permitting process when the price cap was two five zero a megawatt talking about rational behavior its certainly in the political and economic interest of the bush administration not to see californias economy go in the tank not to see the economy of the whole west coast be hammered and suffer accordingly if you presume rational behavior on their part youd have to presume that theyre doing what they think is the right thing but once again its a question of are you going to stand on your ideology regardless of all facts to the contrary or are you going to try and fix given the actual facts that are at play in that market i think even the most committed free market person if theyre principled recognizes that you need a market cop in any market this markets being gamed in a myriad of ways are you getting anywhere with the ferc in making the arguments that youre stating here the question right now is who is the ferc i have not met formally with the two new ferc commissioners since theyve been confirmed which just occurred last week i look forward to a transition period where the ferc gets off its ideology and gets back to practicality and doing its job as a regulator will that happen as long as george bush and dick cheney are saying quite the opposite california needs to do what it needs to do to protect itself but i do think we may have an opportunity in transition we cant count on it but we shouldnt close the door to it the new electricity plants coming on line for the most part are natural gasfired would we still be in a crunch if natural gas prices remain high the puc has been doing everything it possibly can in the last two months and will continue to do it in the next several months to encourage utilities to add natural gas infrastructure the other thing is they have to inject natural gas into storage right now even though we know that the price of natural gas is too high california is being gouged on natural gas isnt everybody else being gouged on natural gas prices no god no prices at the california border are two to three times higher than anyplace else in the country the problem here is the el paso line is the market maker for the price of gas coming in to california because of anticompetitive behavior which i believe was intentional to raise prices that evidence is being heard at the ferc right now are you expecting anything from that administrative law judge at ferc we have to be hopeful the astonishing thing here is that we california cannot count on the federal government

shareholders then you are more out of touch with reality than i previously thought unless you were referring to dynegy shareholders under your leadership the shareholders have been devastated employees have lost their retirements college funds have been desiminated and reputations have been ruined including your own while i applaud your forgoing of the six zero million dollar payment i suspect having taken it would have only added to outrage and probably weakend your position in forthcoming lawsuits and dont feel that it was as self efacing as you have lead us to believe under your direction enron has promoted bafoons charletons and incompetents to the highest management ranks you personally did everything imaginable to lose the confidence of the investment community in my opinion this has got to be the financial disaster of the decade all under your direction you said jeff skilling left for personal reasons and there were not hidden financial problems you told us you were becoming more transparent in financial disclosures and then tried to slip a one two billion dollar equity reduction by us the list goes on and on why should we believe you now one more thing mr lay i suggest take the listing of executive awards off the internet site i suspect new awards will be coming out soon and please dont waste your time sending me self serving feel good memos anymore i

seven am sent by general announcement to all enron worldwide distribution group cc subject enron announces plans to merge with dynegy today we announced plans to merge with dynegy a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that youve worked so hard to build following are the major components of the transaction deal terms the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of zero two six eight five dynegy shares for every enron share for example each one zero zero zero shares of enron stock will be converted to two six eight shares of dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing chevrontexaco owns approximately two six percent of dynegys outstanding common stock chevrontexaco will invest one five billion in dynegy immediately and an additional one billion in dynegy on closing of the merger dynegy will immediately invest one five billion in cash in enrons northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately seven zero zero million shares the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year enron will have immediate access to dynegys one five billion cash investment in enrons northern natural gas subsidiary management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company which will be called dynegy inc and steve bergstrom will be president and coo i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration the makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter two zero zero two this merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers as with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible as i said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history we considered several options but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps we have a list of frequently

your questions if you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at seven one three eight five three five six seven zero i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise including our market reach financial strength and industry experience together we will be a new merchant powerhouse and again thank you for everything you have done for enron

to me a letter addressed to eott dated february one four two zero zero one from the us fish and wildlife service approving our project for participation in the kern water bank compensation bank and authorizing the water bank to extend their incidental take authority to you and your entire project under their master permit this is of course very good news the letter notes however that we still need to purchase compensation acreage both at north coles levee and at the kern water bank specifically we must do the following one contact cheryl harding of kern water bank to acquire two three one acres of compensation credits and to get included in their master permit and two get cheryl harding a letter from the coles levee ecosystem preserve mark poe of aera stating that we have purchased one five three acres of credits for north coles levee or that we have set aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased while i could make these contacts i do not believe that would be wise because as kenny can attest our past experience has been that whenever a lawyer contacts the water bank it prompts them to automatically get their lawyers involved and our experience has been that this only slows things down or worse my suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for one proposed contract for acquisition of two three one acres of compensation credits and two perperwork to include eott and its contractors in their master permit she should also be informed that while we have not yet purchased the one five three acres of ncl credits we will by the end of this week have a letter of credit posted as security as allowed under our state take permit to cover this amount of acreage ask whether a copy of this lc will suffice for her purposes or whether we will need to have the actual acreage purchased as this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new lines it is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed please call me if you have any questions or if you would like otherwise to discuss how to approach this issue thanks a lot eta,09:26:00,No

to void daviss power contracts deals gouge consumers agency tells federal regulators in a move that could undermine californias hardwon control of the power market state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by gov gray davis the state public utilities commission in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governors power strategy is arguing that some of the deals gouge californians the puc says energy firms probably took advantage of the states power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices and it wants some of those prices cut the state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if theyre not renegotiated commissioner richard bilas said i would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down the puc apparently did not tell davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the federal energy regulatory commission its definitely not something thats a favorable thing to have happen to us said oscar hidalgo a spokesman for the state department of water resources which negotiated the contracts hidalgo said the longterm contracts even though more expensive than current market prices are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices it would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out hidalgo said if thats the goal then were back to square one prices would start to creep up the state is paying an average of six nine a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators peak prices for electricity last week were less than three zero hidalgo could not say whether the puc actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned one two five billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases over the past three months lawyers for the puc have filed challenges on various grounds before the federal energy regulatory commission against deals negotiated with pacificorp power marketing inc alliance colton llc sempra energy and a calpine corp subsidiary said puc attorney sean gallagher sempra calpine contracts taken together sempra and calpine have sold about half the electricity that the davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of five three agreements some of which last two zero years in all california has committed to spending at least four three billion for electricity the deal with pacificorp power marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the one billion contract one of davis energy consultants owned stock in the power suppliers parent company gallagher said puc attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts davis spokesman steve maviglio said friday the administration couldnt comment until it had studied the puc submissions the pucs challenges mark the latest battle between davis and the five member commission which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governors three appointees the commission has rebuffed davis attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the longterm power contracts and pay off the planned one two five billion bond issue state treasurers warning state treasurer phil angelides warned last week that the pucs actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a nine billion hole in the state budget next year puc president loretta lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubberstamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer we should not through the instrument of the bonds lock down the policy choices for the state for one five years lynch said last week we should stay as flexible as possible lynch could not be reached for comment on the commissions challenges to the contracts commissioner jeff brown lynchs fellow davis appointee said the filings dont rule out davis bond financing deal nor do they threaten a state default on the longterm contracts he said but federal action could help the state improve the deals he said the state of california has never consciously defaulted on a contract he said even if we renegotiate well renegotiate within the confines of the contract hidalgo however said he doubted the state could modify the contracts under power granted by the legislature he said the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable jan mitchell a spokeswoman for scottishpower parent company of pacificorp power marketing said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations now another california agency is disputing it mitchell said we obviously disagree and well continue to work with ferc making sure the contracts are honored puc critical of dealings the puc argues that the portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its one zero year one billion deal with the company july six that forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts the puc says news reports suggest that the water department paid substantially over the thencurrent market prices for this contract prices which will be passed through to california retail ratepayers the puc said an energy consultant to davis vikram budhraja admitted in august that he owned as much as one zero zero zero zero worth of scottish power stock while the deal was being worked out budhraja sold the stock july three zero and state officials said he had nothing to do with the pacificorp power marketing deal uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the states energy picture while the issue has slipped from the public eye davis solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the puc but from fellow democrats in the state senate which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize southern california edisons finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing while officials fight among themselves the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation,08:30:16,No

eogil our subsidary that owns a three zero interest in the panna mukta and tapti concession areas we now have bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in houston which made it extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer there were a rumors circulating through the office but the reality of the announcement was still a shock to most of the employees in india and houston attached is a memo we handed out to employees but basically we said the following one selling assets or companies is a routine part of enrons strategy to redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities the company has exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not envisioned even twelve months ago in line with this strategy we are placing eogil in the market two depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for eogil we will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other enron entities or for sale as separate packages we anticipate closing the eogil transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by march three one two zero zero one three pending the success outlined in item two we will eliminate enron global ep as an

five commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms we told them it was premature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a psa with a buyer however in general there is a good likelihood that many people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers or through redeployment within enron those people that do not remain with the assets or are not redeployed in enron will be involuntarily terminated march three one two zero zero one unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide transition services to a buyer i would like to keep

two nine zero eight six four dear mr lay my employment with enron is to be terminated the reason given by hr for not meeting performance standards however i firmly believe that this is not the real reason the real one being for defying the wishes of my manager mr lowell bezanismanager egm who i believe was acting in a discriminatory way towards me i have since filed a written complaint to enrons eeo committee this committee having investigated the case has acknowledged that there were working environment issues but has refused to provide me with a written report of their findings as a consequence my reasonable request for a redeployment package has been rejected if my employment is to be prematurely terminated i not only lose my job but also my residence status in the us where i have lived in the past eight years the hr department is fully aware of my situation and i feel that they were taking advantage of this fact when they asked me to sign a waiver not to sue enron in exchange for protecting my status for three zero days i now feel that i am being pushed into a corner unnecessarily since all i have set out to achieve is to bring an awareness of the working conditions and the discrimination which is rife not only towards myself but also to other employees some of whom have left as a result in the department and to move forward with practicable solutions i have enjoyed a number of years as an employee of enron where i have performed to the best of my ability often receiving compliments from clients this cannot be the only way to solve this issue the trigger and retaliation since mr bezanis has been my line manager internal training opportunities have repeatedly been denied to me on august two eight i attended a class of natural gas structuring mr bezanis called the learning center refusing to pay the associated costs however i was welcomed to remain in the class at no charge i felt that this situation could not continue and so i made an appointment with ms shanna funkhouser my hr representative the day previous to the aforementioned meeting i was summoned to appear before msfunkhouser mr bezanis and mr jeff andrews were present in the conference room as i entered feeling intimidated i requested that i meet with ms funkhouser privately the next day in order to submit a formal complaint regarding the eeo as agreed previously she refused and continued with what i can only describe as adisciplinary by accusing me of excessive use of enron property and equipment i was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination ms funkhouser explained that her actions were based on the following the assumption that i was making long distance personal calls from work that i was making jobapplications by company email unequal employment opportunities and unfair treatment as a manager mr bezanis has intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals he has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance prc process which according to the prc rules should be judged also by my peers and clients by review until now iam still have not been informed of my prc results made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an energy index as a potential useful trading instrument my idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the department offsite but the reaction of mr bezanis was of anger for not going through him first i was banned by him from developing the idea further discrimination it is our belief that mr bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees especially competent women as equals his rough stifling and unfair management style has led to the resignation of ms courtney campbell the other only woman reporting to him hostile working environment the working environment under mr bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence we are managed by threats rather than constructive comments wrongful termination knowing i was unfairly treated enron hr has not helped address my concerns i was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the midyear prc process ms cindy olson admitted that the prc practices might be unfair but she said she had no power to reopen the past prc cases i feel i have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole enron organization attempts to protect the managers no matter how wrong they are i request your attention and help during my most difficult time i thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case yours sincerely mingcheng lian,08:54:25,No

there is a legitimate discussion going on within the company that at the very least will result in a more flexible approach to market structure and perhaps this is my preference will result in a sharpening and refocusing of our positions that will acknowledge the necessity for an lmplike approach in realtime to achieve sufficient depth of liquidity with a keen focus on developing forward markets in transmission rights airing our differences and doubts externally creates absolutely no benefit at the end of the day were here no matter where we end up on this issue to enhance the

and diane and alex it is not exactly true but i can see how people got that idea enron has decided to withdraw the filings we made in ercot our position on the ercot market structure is being reviewed enron continually goes through a process of reviewing its policies to make sure they are consistent with our business needs i can tell you that there are some strong supporters of hogans policies inside enron now and these supporters are finding an ear currently we are reviewing the positions we are taking on market structure in ercot and the east we have to ensure we are practical from a business point of view and not being just religious about our views probably the number one concern of the business people is the ability to have a deep liquid market for trading i believe that much of the discussion has focused on the ways in which we can achieve such a market after our review of ercot enron may indeed support a pjmlike structure for the realtime market but the filings we make will likely not imply that this approach be implemented everywhere i expect that we will be free to support different approaches in different parts of the country depending on the evolution of the markets in each location what does this mean for our position in california so far nothing we are standing firm on our california position supporting the iso and stakeholderapproved approach for congestion management and do not have any plans to make new proposals further we have the support of the traders on this please feel free to call with any concerns believe me im having just as hard of

overview of the company heres an update of what we discussed during the call we told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses it took more than a few weeks to get where we are today heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation in hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years those include investments in azu rix india and brazil they have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and on top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our eight k filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review core businesses our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company theyre our competitive advantage th ese include natural gas pipeline businesses gas and power businesses in north america and europe retail businesses in north america and europe and coal businesses in north america and europe the events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter

leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships noncore businesses our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision we have invested more than eight billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal we have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses we alre ady have more than eight zero zero million in assets contracted for sale this year th ey

Extended,el paso south mainline shutin extended the us transportation departments office of pipeline safety ops has ordered all three of the pipes comprising el paso natural gas one bcfd south mainline from texas to california to remain closed until extensive tests can be done to ensure they are safe to operate the order came in the wake of saturdays explosion and fire that ripped through one of those lines the three zero inch pipeline one one zero three at a pecos river crossing near carlsbad nm killing one one people because of the internal corrosion discovered on the failed section of pipeline ops is directing el paso to submit a corrective action plan for ops approval that will identify all areas on approximately three three zero miles of pipeline that may be subject to internal corrosion said kelley s coyner head of the research and special programs administration rspa for the ops in a prepared statement the dot is requiring that all segments of the three pipelines in the vicinity of pecos river remain closed until such time that the department has determined that the pipeline segments are safe to operate this is necessary to protect the public and the environment and to prevent a similar failure on this pipeline system the plan will require inspection assessment and repair or replacement of all damaged areas based on the results of these and other tests el paso must develop a plan to assess the integrity of the remainder of its one zero zero zero zero mile pipeline system the ops corrective action order was issued late wednesday after el paso officials had been saying for most of the day it was only a matter of hours before at least one of the lines was back in operation one industry source said testing could easily take three weeks to a month even if no repairs are necessary the ops order directs el paso to one conduct hydrostatic pressure testing of the lines two perform a direct assessment of the integrity of the pipelines by both xray and ultrasonic examinations and three because internal corrosion has been detected in the failed section of the pipeline el paso also must submit a corrective action plan to ops identifying all areas on the approximately three three zero miles of pipeline that may have internal corrosion even if el paso passes all these tests and ops allows it to return to service each of the three lines will be subject to a two zero pressure restriction according to coyner the restriction will be reviewed in one zero working days and may be removed upon the receipt of more information about the factors that contributed to the aug one nine explosion ops has the authority to take other actions if warranted the ops yesterday issued the sevenpage corrective action order which permits it to suspend or restrict the operations of a pipeline after it determined that the el paso lines were hazardous el paso has been notified of the order and it has one zero days to request a hearing to be held in either houston or washington dc if el paso fails to comply with any part of the order it could face civil penalties of up to two five zero zero zero a day and the case could be referred to the us attorney general for appropriate relief in the us district court according to stacey gerard associate administrator for pipeline safety preliminary investigations of ruptured line one one zero three by the ops and the national transportation safety board ntsb indicate that significant internal corrosion was visible on the failed section internal corrosion may have been a contributing factor in the line failure the possibility of internal corrosion on other lines in the area is a safety concern the ops order applies to the three zero inch line one one zero three which incurred the most damage and the parallel two six inch line one one zero zero that sustained an undetermined amount of damage at the pecos river crossing due to the fire it also covers the adjacent three zero inch line one one one zero whose damages are still undetermined lines one one zero three and one one one zero were built in one nine five zero and line one one zero zero in one nine four seven within nine zero days el paso will be required to submit to the ops southwest region director an analysis of the continued safe operation of the three lines based on the testing and inspection required under this order in related action rep john dingell dmi who has been a sharp critic of ops for its allegedly lax handling of pipeline safety violators is in the process of drafting a letter to the agency to determine whether its failure to take aggressive action towards pipelines may have created an atmosphere that led to the tragedy on el paso,05:11:00,No
