 2001",i am quite involved and there are lots of regulatorygovernmental issues one first a comment about the requested to complete the project there is no way to cover the embarrassment factor last december a substantial budget increase has requested and approved by the board reportedly on a nevercomebackagain basis however as it was later discovered a it did not included a number of major charges that had been spent but never accounted for and b had a more optimistic scenario of project completion two shell has not made a commitment to increase their prorata investment they have until may one five decide we may have a dispute eventually leading to arbitration three in order to improve the economics of the project as of may four we are terminating the ypf gas contract it is a contract right and renegotiating with ypf and others this may be going to arbitration four and lastly we have a full blown dispute with furnas inching each day towards arbitrationlitigation before its is finally settled the root case of the dispute was the interference of government agency something like the independent public attorneys office the ministerio publico on the construction of the pipeline and now its was grown into the controversy involving aneel because of the cuiaba contract was the result of the bid under am old regulatory regime and now furnas wants us to take the market risks of the new regulatory system see two files below five last week we finally forced the issue with furnas getting closer to a legal dispute we put them on notice of our contract rights under the goverment actionforece majure clauses in parallel we are also launching a lobbying effort to get our story across the government officials i have a more pesimistic view than pete about the speed of success logically he is correct how can the government of brazil allow this matter to spin out of control if we engage in a legal fight he is hopeful that using our government levers we can get a quicker resolution my reading is that the present brazilian government is very split on energy issues and there are those in the government coalition that would welcome a dispute to stop the privatization efforts i believe that we have to launch the lobbying effort for pr purposes but that it will not produce results until we take furnas to court not prevent a legal dispute and there is a clear reading that we are correct the center piece of the dispute will be our claim of government interference and the analysis of our project management effort during this period of force majeure in other words can we collect part of the bubget overrun from furnas our detailed analysis will be ready at the end of may six on the bright side due to the brazilian energy crisis aneel called me last tuesday to let me know that it had been decided that they will extend the current diesel subsidy for half the plant output to december rtwo four million per month and expand the diesel coverage to the whole plant through furnas where furnas would pay for the diesel in the other half of the power plant another rtwo four million per month i will have to negotiate a contract amendment jose from amr ibrahim on zero four two seven two zero zero one one one one eight am to jose bestardenron_developmentenron_development cc james d steffesnaenronenron richard shapironaenronenron subject cuiaba additional cost overrun rac meeting of april two seven two zero zero one jose i have learnt from the rac meeting today that a dash for one two eight four million for additional cost overruns will be put in front of the board monday three zero th i am sure that you are involved in this specific issue but i am erring on the conservative side is there any regulatory issue that we should raise or point out from this end eg whether the regulatory regimen allows these cost overruns to be rolled into the rate base hence the revenue requirementor not of course let me know if i could be of any help or you need a follow up action from houston side best regards ai seven one three eight five three three zero three eight,13:05:00,No

intended to secure power supplies for california two zero the legislature has been meeting since early january in a zero one special extraordi nary sessionzero one eight to address the power market crisis in the state and the new la w represents their first significant piece of legislation the bill ab one establishes a new mechanism for purchasing power for the statezero one s busines sestwo

ious under current retail rateszero one will covertwo zero wholesale power market costs incurred by the state the law reflects the obsession by california lawmakers with avoiding a rate increase rather than focusing on the underlying flaws in californiazero one s market structure ab one ushers in several important changes to the california market structure two zero it also contains several key provisions that capture the political mood in the state highlights of the bill include power buying authority transferred the responsibility for purchasing pow er for the customers of californiazero one s ious has been transferred to the calif ornia department of water resources cdwr the california utilities will continu etwo zero to operate and schedule their remaining generating facilities and contracts t he difference between the utilitieszero one total load and the sum of their resour ces referred to as the utilitieszero one zero one net shortzero one eight amount will be

since midjanuary when the nearbankruptcy of southern california edison sce and pacific gas electric pge threatened totwo zero disrupt supplies to their customers cdwr is a state agency that manages water reservoirs and transportation systems in the state cdwr uses an enormous amount of electricity to transport water across california and provides critical loadshedding capability to the

large compli cated energy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of californiazero one stwo zero utilities portfolio of transactions the intent of ab one is to allow cdwr to execute a portfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and their customers cdwr has until january two two zero zero three to execute contracts cdwr will take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse it has issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms including month ly annual twoyear threeyear and longer cdwr may also enter into options thus although cdwrzero one s role is intended to be temporary the contracts th at it executes could extend many years power for munis cdwr may purchase power on behalf of some california municipal utilities at the municipal utilitieszero one election new payment scheme cdwr will be entitled to a portion of existing utilit y rates to pay for the cost of purchased power interest on bonds and administrative expenses this payment stream will be equal to the differenc e between the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates averaging about zero zero seven per kilowatthour nine one kwhnine three and the utilities zero one two zero costs to run their own generation plants costs of bilateral and qualifying facility contracts and the costs of ancillary services the cdwr share of retail ra tes is referred to as the california purchase adjustment cpa it is not clear whether the cpa will cover wholesale power market costs current prices for multiyear power contracts may lie above the cpa in addition if investors believe that the cpa is inadequate to cover costs the entire program may b e abandoned new bonds bonds will be issued to secure power the total amount of bond s issued may not exceed four times the cpa the state will transfer five zero zero mill ion from the general fund to jumpstart the program which begins immediately two zero this seed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by cdwr from the califor nia utilitieszero one customers and municipal utilities if they opt in new residential rate freeze the california public utilities commission cpuc is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it ha s completed paying all outstanding obligations this locks in the recent nine percent residential rate increase indefinitely governor gray davis thus ke eps his pledge not to increase rates further retail competition to help secure a stable payment stream for the newtwo zero bonds ab one enables the cpuc to prohibit the utilitieszero one retail customers from two zero choosing an alternative electricity provider until cdwrzero one s obligations are paid two zero although the cpuc has yet to act on this the action would effectively halt the competitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the cdwr progra m taxpayer protection ab one directs that the new bonds clearly state zero one nine one nnine three either the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state of california istwo zero pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on this bondzero one eight thus the bonds are secured only by the payment stream from utility rates no assets affected the cdwr is granted neither ownership nor control of utility assets ironically the authority now granted cdwr is what california utilities had essentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity prices by executing a portfolio of transactions the utilities were never provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts in addition the utilities have more experience to perform this function than cdwr rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity pricestwo zero california has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing function sce and pge are still left to contend with uncollected costs fro m past energy purchases although they will no longer incur costs associated two zero with buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail rates the utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved it is not clear

achieving a comprehensive solution requires a tangible process that is the principals need to get in a room face to face for however long it takes to work out a resolution it was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week and that it should take place in sacramento it was decided that the legislature and the attorney general needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible ie next week there was some discussion regarding the release today of plan b plan b is a plan proposed by democratic and republican legislators as an alternative to the mou

item two identify the components of a comprehensive solution it was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrows meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are the following is a brief outline which is not intended to be definitive but a starting point for discussion utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process decrease demand establish realtime pricing implement demand buydown and other conservation programs create a real market remove the state from the powerbuying business as soon as possible eg once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness approximately three six months return the procurement role to the utilities reinstate direct access immediately for all customers within one eight two four months create a corenoncore market structure for electricity similar to californias market structure for natural gas keep the industry in the hands of the private sector reject proposals calling on the state to take over transmission generation etc resolve outstanding legal claims investigations etc resolution requires certainty and prompt payment understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion

calls that we have had during the crisis surrounding enron that i have been able to fully express the depth of my g ratitude to each of you i am as grateful as one can be like many of you i loved this place and feel an immense sense of loss at what is occurring my heart also aches for the financial losses that so many have suffered not only in our group but also throughout the company particularly given how much all of us have given to this place some for many years i have been searching for a way to capture what weve done here and was reading a book the other day about teddy roosevelt former president of the united st ates and saw a quote that i thought was appropriate to our group and circu mstancesthe quote istwo zero the credit belongs to the person who is actually in the arenawho strives valiantly who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions and spends himself in worthy causes who at best knows the triumph of high achievem ent and who at worst if he fails fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither vict ory nor defeat the work that we did here was great the way we did it i believe sets an example for those who will attempt to fill our shoesand we fought for the right cause ie competitive markets around the world our victories we re many and often directly due to our presence and leadershipthe failure t hat we are experiencing as a company however that is so deep and so thoro ugh was not of our making i dont know exactly what the days and weeks a head hold for any of us but i am quite confident that the good work that w e do and the way that we do it and the sense of community that we were abl e to create in this group will show up in new places and new companies all around the world over the next months and years i hope to speak to many if not all of you on a one to one basis over the next several weeks to ex press my thanks and gratitude for having had the opportunity to work with y ou but i also want to take this opportunity to wish each of you the best i n the future and during this holiday season thank you,14:50:58,No

bureau and lifted out a tissuewrapped package this he saidis not a slip this is lingerie he discarded the tissue and handed me the slip it was exquisite silk handmade and trimmed with a cobweb of lace the price tag with an astronomical figure on it was still attached jan bought this the first time we went to new york at least eight or nine years agoshe never wore it she was saving it for a special occasion well i guess this is the occasion he took the slip from me and put it on the bed with the other clothes we were taking to the mortician his hands lingered on the soft material for a moment then he slammed the drawer shut and turned to me dont ever save anything for a special occasion every day youre alive is a special occasion i remembered those words through the funeral and the days that followed when i helped him and my niece attend to all the sad chores that follow an unexpected death i thought about them on the plane returning to california from the midwestern town where my sisters family lives i thought about all the things that she hadnt seen or heard or done i thought about the things that she had done without realizing that they were special im still thinking about his words and theyve changed my life im reading more and dusting less im sitting on the deck and admiring the view without fussing about the weeds in the garden im spending more time with my family and friends and less time in committee meetings whenever possible life should be a pattern of experience to savor not endure im trying to recognize these moments now and cherish them im not saving anything we use our good china and crystal for every special event such as losing a pound getting the sink unstopped the first camellia blossom i wear my good blazer to the market if i feel like it my theory is if i look prosperous i can shell out two eight four nine for one small bag of groceries without wincing im not saving my good perfume for special parties clerks in hardware stores and tellers in banks have noses that function as well as my party going friends someday and one of these days are losing their grip on my vocabulary if its worth seeing or hearing or doing i want to see and hear and do it now im not sure what my sister wouldve done had she known that she wouldnt be here for the tomorrow we all take for granted i think she would have called family members and a few close friends she might have called a few former friends to apologize and mend fences for past squabbles i like to think she would have gone out for a chinese dinner her favorite food im guessing ill never know its those little things left undone that would make me angry if i knew that my hours were limited angry because i put off seeing good friends whom i was going to get in touch with someday angry because i hadnt written certain letters that i intended to write one of these days angry and sorry that i didnt tell my husband and daughter often enough how much i truly love them im trying very hard not to put off hold back or save anything that would add laughter and luster to our lives and every morning when i open my eyes i tell myself that every day every minute every breath truly isa gift if youve received this it is because someone cares for you if youre too busy to take the few minutes that it would take right now to forward this to ten people would it be the first time you didnt do that little thing that would make a difference in your relationship i can tell you it certainly wont be the last take a few minutes to send this to a few people you care about just to let them know that youre thinking of them may love litter your life with blessings to realize the value of one month ask a mother who gave birth to a premature baby to realize the value of one week ask the editor of a weekly newspaper to realize the value of one hour ask the lovers who are waiting to meet to realize the value of one minute ask a person who missed the train to realize the value of

created covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional enron shares diluting the position of current shareholders however enron treasurer ben glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about three three billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities known as the marlin water trust ii the marlin water capital corp ii the osprey trust and osprey i inc the notes are coming due during the next two zero months mr glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes also enron is selling other assets proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes which ultimately are guaranteed by enron he said it appears that asset sales will raise at least two two billion by the end of next year this amount includes cash proceeds of one five five billion from the previously announced sale of enrons portland general electric utility unit enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of two zero zero two there are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds to repay the notes mr glisan said but if we are wrong we will issue equity mr glisan said a worstcase scenario would involve issuing as much as one billion in stock enron said it has about eight five zero million shares outstanding making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in enrons share price in four pm new york stock exchange composite trading enron shares were down eight six cents to one nine seven nine the stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about two seven million shares changing hands early this year enron stock was more than eight zero a share during the past week shares of the energytrading giant have dropped more than four zero early last week enron reported a six one eight million thirdquarter loss resulting from one zero one billion in writeoffs the company also disclosed a one two billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by enron chief financial officer andrew s fastow in july mr fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors on monday enron disclosed that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the transactions related to mr fastow enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper the turmoil of the past several days prompted enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with wall street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors enron chairman and chief executive kenneth lay said while we are extremely disappointed with our stock price our businesses are performing very well mr lay and other executives said enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs mr fastow the chief financial officer took part in the conference call but neither he nor mr lay would answer any questions concerning the fastowrelated partnership which was known as ljmtwo coinvestment lp mr lay said the sec was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement which has raised conflictofinterest questions among analysts and others mr lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions mr lay said he was very concerned about the way andys character has been loosely tossed about he added we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy internal ljmtwo documents indicate that mr fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership billions of dollars of enron assets and stock were involved in ljmtwo related transactions according to enron sec filings during the conference call analysts even some who have been longtime enron fans challenged executives about the fastow partnership arrangement and the companys often opaque financial reports theres the appearance you are hiding something said goldman sachs analyst david fleischer you need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board mr lay responded

one zero two four two zero zero one the new york times page one column five c two zero zero one new york times company enron has ample access to cash the companys chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional writeoffs stemming from unusual financing activities in a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after enrons stock plunged on monday the chief executive kenneth w lay strongly defended the companys chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the securities and exchange commission was looking into but he refused to go into detail on the transaction that enron made with partnerships run by andrew s fastow the chief financial officer in addition mr fastow while declaring that enron expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations declined to answer any questions about it the conference call which began just as trading opened on the new york stock exchange at first seemed to be reassuring investors within minutes of the beginning of the call the share price rallied to two three two five but it soon began falling and ended the day down eight six cents at one nine seven nine the days low of one nine six two was the lowest since jan one two one nine nine eight and was down seven eight percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of two zero zero zero until recently most investors focused on the companys reported operating earnings which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets but the focus has shifted to a series of transactions some involving offbalancesheet financing one involving partnerships controlled by mr fastow led to a one two billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to sec inquiries that the company disclosed on monday one of the companys strongest supporters has been david fleischer an analyst at goldman sachs but he told mr lay on the call yesterday that enron had to be more forthcoming with information there is an appearance that you are hiding something he said after the call mr fleischer expressed disappointment theyve engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about and that are hard to understand he said in an interview they have not been as forthcoming in explaining them as is needed he said but he said he was still recommending the stock i dont think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans he said in the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company there is tremendous value here mr lay cited the sec inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by mr fastow but he emphasized that both he and the companys board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy mr lay said that auditors from arthur andersen had carefully reviewed enrons reporting in conjunction with another offbalancesheet vehicle called marlin that company owns onethird of azurix an enron subsidiary that owns wessex a british water utility the auditors have determined there is no writedown required he said under questioning by richard grubman of highfields capital management a money management firm mr grubman said that marlin owed almost one billion on debt that was guaranteed by enron but had no assets other than the azurix stake noting that enron had paid about three zero zero million to buy a third of azurix from public shareholders and had since taken writedowns on its investment in azurix mr grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of enron shares mr lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details eventually he cut off mr grubman i know youre trying to drive the stock price down and youve done a pretty good job of it mr lay said but lets move on to the next question mr fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had one eight five billion in such debt outstanding he said it was backed by three three five billion in bank lines of credit of which one seven five billion will expire next may if it is not renewed mr lay said he was sorry about the misunderstanding that resulted when his brief mention of the one two billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts that reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report but it did not he said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future but made no promises the large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings and so was not in the earnings release but it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement the sec is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct after one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as marlin mr lay said the company will look into providing such statements copyright two zero zero zero dow jones company inc all rights reserved options report surge in optimism prompts straddles in enron and cisco by kopin tan dow jones newswires one zero

questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that enrons dealings are aboveboard i for one find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions he said lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the ljm partnerships because of the sec inquiry he did say enron was aware an inherent conflict of interest would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with enron in response enron set up procedures which lay said were rigorously followed to ensure shareholder interests wouldnt be compromised there was a chinese wall between ljm and enron he said adding that enron wasnt obligated to do deals with the ljm entities and did so when it was in enrons best interest lay and enrons board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in fastow he added fastow resigned his roles with the ljm entities in june after criticism from wall street enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships it took a three five million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders equity by one two billion as a result during the call enron executives also addressed other issues they stressed that enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing

vilified for it hounded by discrimination lawyers and aarp last week less than a year after launching it ceo jacques nasser was moved to dump a brand new executive grading system designed to weed out the least capable one zero of fords managers the short answer is that ford isnt ge though jack welch has been a model for what mr nasser seeks to accomplish at the auto company bringing such a torquemada system into a firm that faces slowing sales and whose own boss considers his colleagues notoriously flabby and easy on themselves meant it was a downsizing scheme from the start whether advertised that way or not ge didnt introduce its version until a decade after the neutron jack phase but never mind trumpeting a win last week aarp declared its victory goes way beyond ford it sure does forced ranking has waxed and waned as a fad over the decades and most students of management hold their noses around it its resurgence at a time when many employers are contemplating their first layoffs in years can only mean that companies are nervous about preserving their freedom to hire and fire in a world run increasingly by the jobdiscrimination bar ask any nondeluded european what makes the us economy relatively nimble is that companies are not afraid to take on workers because they know they can always get rid of them later harsh as this sounds its why we have a lush job market compared to the employment saharas of the old world yet firing in america has been a work in progress half a decade ago enlightened companies tried employee buyouts but the lawyers descended forcing companies to offer the buyouts indiscriminately result highly marketable workers took the windfall and immediately found other jobs while people who considered themselves unemployable skipped the loot and clung to their cubicles other companies on the theory that it was ok to tell people they had to go because their functions or departments were being discontinued bravely downsized the oldfashioned way but this was no proof against lawsuits remember texaco cocacola and others where the very existence of affirmativeaction programs became fodder for litigation by both minorities and older white employees searching for a way out of the legal maze ford tried two years ago to combine forced ranking with buyouts aiming offers exclusively at lowranked employees result grumbling in the hallways of rewarding failure and good employees angling for low grades so they could become eligible for a golden parachute finally starting this year ford opted for an outandout forced ranking system which would have given one zero of whitecollar employees annually a c grade that meant either shape up or youre gone next year microsoft lucent conoco enron and eds all have used forced ranking to maintain or improve the quality of their work forces while many find the idea distasteful or complain it substitutes a yearly spasm for what should be a continuous process at least it solves a real problem survey after survey finds that even the happiest workerbees gripe about their employers reluctance to get strict with poor performers a recent mckinsey poll of managers at big companies found that only one six said their employer could even recognize the difference between stars and slackers but ford was already in the soup over the explorerfirestone fiasco it didnt stand a chance when the detroit papers opened a new front over its abc grading system for one eight zero zero zero managers accentuating the coverage was a simmering quest to discover any sort of rift between mr nasser and his chairman bill ford greatgrandson of the founder mr ford has somehow been anointed keeper of the companys conscience because of blood chemistry or something inevitably he wants to be liked and wants the company to be liked putting a ford in the chairmanship was probably the worst thing the company could have done at a time when mr nasser was clearly set on giving the place a kick in the pants in the ranking controversy mr ford soon was reported to be concerned about the systems impact on morale notice how this differs from the system is an urgent necessity so ford can become a better company with this kind of support management quickly wilted in the face of pressure from the oldfolks lobby which has appointed itself guardian of anybody over four five and other victim contingents mr nasser didnt help himself by appearing in a ford diversity video haranguing an audience for containing too many white faces or by installing rewards for executives who meet minority hiring goals presto lawsuits galore the ones ford will have the most trouble with are those filed by white males claiming they were victims of age discrimination in order to make way for blacks and women one of the ironies as ford shows is that companies these days have reasons of their own for recruiting minorities and women were the supposedly archaic one nine thcentury principle of freedom of contract still in effect ie employers are free to hire and fire at will there would be a lot more affirmative action a lot more honestly pursued ge may not exactly be the rainbow coalition but it does have a lesson for ford under its version of forced rankings one zero of managers are assigned to a bottom grade each year which means theyre cut off from the rich booty ge awards the top two zero and the job security of the workaday seven zero if lowranked managers dont improve they are asked to move on a big difference though is that the process is not concentrated in a single highly neuroticized annual ritual ge carries on with much yearround mentoring and bellowing and measuring so nobody has cause to be surprised by the score he gets in fact anyone who went to work there in the past one five years would have known exactly what he was getting into heres the lesson nobody doubts that ges hiring and firing whatever the color or gender of the fodder is all about business it takes time to build a

oil easily and get a significant market share i also see a role for us in china india and the middle east he said tyumen controlled by russias alfa conglomerate saw foreign oil majors involvement as a key to its growth we would welcome a strategic partner to take a stake in the firm and in fact we are now in talks with several foreign partners including texaco kukes said he added earlier talks with phillips had had no result tyumen is involved in the one one billion kovykta project with bp and several russian firms to produce and ship gas to china as well as in transnefts adria pipeline project

and power gas is an essential component of a verticallyintegrated oil company and in the way we see ourselves in future kukes said we aim that in five years one zero one five percent of our revenues will come from gas and condensate but aggressive expansion has brought tyumen into conflict with competitors it has locked horns with archrival interros to wrest control over a stake in kovykta and its role in oil firm sidanco where bp owns one zero percent has been criticised wed like to get at least two five percent in kovykta kukes said noting tyumen was keen for bp which has a three one percent stake to remain project leader tyumen also angered influential gas trader itera by trying to obtain control over its bankrupt gas producer rospan rospan is a profitable firm but for some

quickly find the right answer elsewhere for free or for short money using thelawnet why is this significant and why would we advertise our competitors simple with everything in the wexis universe always just a click or two away on the internet you no longer need to pick and choose resources and interestingly you no longer necessarily require expensive subscriptions for years the management question has been whether to make that onerous annual commitment to company a or company b but thanks to the internet you can have just what you need at the precise time you need it on a payperview basis choosing the right tool for the job is the trick but thats easy once you know your options useful bells and whistles or tedious overkill thelawnet custom browser lacks some of wexis bells and whistles for instance using our metasearchable database of four million plus federal and state appellate judicial opinions you can quickly call up a relevant list of cases that have construed the statute rule reg or cite that you need to learn more about it is just as easy to quickly jump to the relevant excerpt of each case to assess relevancy whats missing are the little colored arrows indicating whether a court followed or distinguished your case for some the lack of every conceivable enhancement can be a deal breaker others however prefer to draw their own conclusions by checking cases for themselves because at some point in their career something happened which caused them to question whether the best lawyers are the ones still writing headnotes depending on the job at hand the mind numbing array of costly high falutin wexis icons and symbols scattered throughout a document may be very useful or very confusing and unnecessary the internet an incubator for choice we advertise our competitors because we recognize that wexis has been a work in progress for generations and we know that you will probably always have a relationship with them at some level subscription

skilling and the enron advisory council from gavyn davies goldman sachs re the global oil price shock since our meeting in houston the spike in world oil prices has gripped the attention of financial markets i attach a paper which analyses the genesis of the present oil price increase the likelihood of it proving permanent and the probable impact on the world economy the bottom line is the following one the recent increase in the oil price has been due fundamentally to an increase in global demand and not to the activities of opec operating as an oil cartel in fact opec does not seem to have enough immediate supply headroom to make much difference to the situation for many months the danger of shortages will therefore be very acute this winter even with normal weather conditions this could lead to temporary spikes in the price to well over four zero barrel we see a similar situation or worse developing in natural gas two however we do not see this situation as permanent in terms of deep fundamentals the equilibrium price for oil in the long term is still only about one eight barrel within about one two months a large increase in the supply of oil should push prices back down again possibly quite sharply our present forecast for the average oil price in two zero zero one is two seven barrel somewhat below todays spot price levels but we do not expect to see this oil price downturn before next summer three if oil prices do indeed average two seven bl in two zero zero one this will prove to be an oil shock for the developed economies which is the same in magnitude as the gulf war shock a decade ago it will reduce net disposable income for the oecd economies by about zero seven and add about zero nine to headline inflation numbers all of these effects will already be in the data by about two zero zero zero qfour so on our main forecast there should be little or no further adverse effects through two zero zero one four on this oil price scenario gdp growth in the developed economies will slow from about three nine in two zero zero zero to about three four in two zero zero one not a bad outturn five what if the oil price sustains four zero bl next year this would give us another round of effects about the same as those mentioned in para three above even then however these effects should not be enough to push the world into recession growth should still be adequate at about two five three zero six the main risks to this conclusion are that a spike in oil prices and possible oil shortages this winter cause a drop in equity prices and a large dip in business and consumer confidence this could then lead to a more pronounced downturn in gdp next year especially if it triggers the kind of correction in the us that larry and i have been worrying about for a long time but this should prove just about avoidable assuming sensible policy responses seven this may therefore all work out a bit like the winter of one nine nine eight nine nine going

this last exchange has been very helpful the question that we need some guidance on is how detailed he wants these answers and what he will do with the results there are at least two levels that we could look at effectively one fairly quickly a repeat of the analysis done in the summer of nine eight when we looked at the price spikes in the midwest it would need to focus on san diego since that seems to be where the price problem is today along with the midwest and also get a glimmer on rumor picked up here the impact of ca price spikes on oregon consumers the conclusion from nine eight was that price spikes are necessary to send investment price signals for both generation additions and for dsm investments load response presumably this would carry forward to a two zero zero zero study two a more careful look at the same areas described above but more focused on how the wholesale prices find their way to end use consumers we covered this only in a cursory fashion in nine eight here we would need to do two things the first is make certain that dan and the ferc senior folks understand the basics that the price spikes in the midwest and in the other bilateral markets only affect the incremental transactions the lesson of nine eight not all kwh this is different from price spikes in the pool markets where they set the price for all kwh the second point is to see that there is an understanding of the role of a forward market and a hedge ie that you could look on eol and buy forward a seven xtwo four for the summer say and pay a market price to protect you against the volatility on an hourly basis by absorbing it in a three month contract the price signal for investment conclusion would carry forward as above what do you think the level of interest need is and how quickly does he need some or all of the answers this is a good time for tca to tackle this we have or had a quiet moment for both fagan and rao who are the two experts on data development and analysis

want to learn what the problems are and to educate his staff in that regard we have offered to have some of his staff down to use some of enrons tools he was specifically asking for the data below to counter the bent at ferc for price caps i didnt get a feeling that he would use the data to say that everything is fine in fact we took him through some parking examples and he asked that we hold a seminar type activity for some of his senior staffers he is in the process of bringing on some staffers that can act agressively on hotline issues etc he was very familiar with the other problems on the grid he also asked kevin why enron doesnt want lmp everywhere because with our staffing we can run over everyone else kevin told him that then there is no market liquidity and we cant trade with ourselves as it is now there are less than one zero big players due to the transmission risk we explained in detail what happens in the into markets and why it is so difficult to deal with transmissionphysical risk kevin said that even the big bank players like morgan stanley usually flip the product before it goes to liquidation so they do not have to take transmission risk dan l having come from gas understood the liquidity issues and had a good discussion with kevin he sat down in kevins chair and looked at pricing on eol overall it was a very positive meeting kevin was

'tim.belden@enron.com'""]",National Post Column,at least some reporterscolumnists get it this is a column from the national post in canada eric priggish and piggish in california mark steyn national post a hurricane devastated tristan da cunha last month it swept in may two three but no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the islands radio link to the outside world the storm blew sheep into the chilly south atlantic killed many cattle damaged every single home on the island demolished the hospital and community centre blew the roof off the radio station and wrecked the albatross the only pub in the only village edinburgh of the seven seas for a week after the storm the entire island was without electricity and no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it not the islands colonial masters in london not the governor who doesnt actually reside there but prefers to live one two six zero miles away on st helena tristan da cunhas nearest neighbour st helena is manhattan to tristans weehawken new jersey plunked in the ocean midway between argentina and south africa tristan da cunha is the worlds most isolated human settlement its contact with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a british supply vessel plus the occasional cruise ship which anchors offshore when its safe to do so now thats living off the grid the east india company won a charter to settle tristan in one six five eight and its been a crown colony since one eight three four populated by a handful of families from the scottish borders there are just seven surnames on the island glass green hagan lavarello repetto rogers and swain all two nine zero of them turned up in london four zero years ago when the islands volcano erupted and they were evacuated to the imperial capital in the roaring traffics boom midst the glitter of one of the worlds great cities the islanders voted to return home though even getting there was tricky as their landing dock was covered in lava today the colony is virtually selfsufficient in food and has a reasonably thriving economy based on crawfish and selling its commemorative postage stamps to overseas philatelists london has offered oseven five zero zero zero to repair the communications equipment and pay for a new hospital you can build a hospital for under seven five zero zero zero quid amazing otherwise the islanders are just doing what they usually do making the best of things while theyre waiting for the new hospital theyve arranged for a south african fishing vessel to ferry out a secondhand xray machine when it sails next week now consider by way of contrast the inhabitants of what george w bush amusingly calls the great state of california once upon a time california was like they say of tristan da cunha the furthest thing at least in terms of the north american continent today with a population the size of canadas its one of the worlds largest economies the home base of americas biggest industry entertainment but inside many a studio vicepresident is a tristan da cunha islander trying to get out deep in their hearts assuming for the purposes of discussion that studio vicepresidents have hearts they share the same rugged virtues as the tristanians though they prefer something a little better than a one zero zero zero zero zero hospital and theyve no desire to scrape a living from catching crawfish but if the pool boy wants to have a go up the deep end hes welcome to try and therein lies the contradiction californias selfinflicted energy crisis has exposed the preposterousness of poseurconservationism in a booming economy which state has the most rigorous conservation program california which has the lowest per capita electricity consumption california and which state is panicking at the prospect of a summer of rolling blackouts by now impeccably progressive california should have learned the hard way that conservation is not a viable policy for a nonstagnant economy instead a rolling blackout here a rolling blackout there and theyre running around like headless chickens governor gray davis is lashing out at everyone in sight bush and cheney are irresponsible the power generators are unconscionable no wait theyre snakes and robber barons and how do you treat unconscionable robber snakes like ken lay ceo of enron corp i would love said bill lockyer californias attorneygeneral to personally escort lay to an eight xone zero cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says hi my name is spike honey as the states attorneygeneral mr lockyer cannot summarily sentence citizens to anal rape but no doubt once the guys convicted he can make some quiet recommendations as to appropriate cell mates fortunately for mr lay as chief exec of the worlds largest energy trader he doesnt live in california he lives in texas indeed very few of the folks the state of california would like to sic spike on are within their jurisdiction doubtless the taxpayers of british columbia whose bc hydro has been living high off the hog on californias woes could also use a little light buggery but i cant see a canadian court approving extradition nevertheless in a state thats overregulated bans new power plants and is addicted to price caps mr lockyer has ingeniously managed to come up with yet another disincentive for anybody in the energy business to relocate to lalaland california bought into the softeco sierra club illusion that somehow one could be a conservationist with no consequences for ones economic wellbeing to put it in terms californians can understand suppose you build a house out in the desert but you dont want to buy a car because thats bad for the environment isnt it so instead every morning you call a taxicab in the city to drive out pick you up and take you into the office not only does it have no environmental benefit but theres no point bitching and whining because the driver charges you a fare that bears no relation to the cost of gas yet thats what governor davis and the anal attorney are demanding price caps through its own incompetence california is wholly dependent on energy generators and distributors from other jurisdictions but it expects those companies to forgo the interests of their own stockholders and service california ie hollywood and silicon valley as an act of public welfare a five zero zero profit is swinelike piggish and totally unreasonable says medea benjamin of the california human rights group global exchange she may have a point but if californias going to institute price caps they might like to start closer to home after all if enrons board members dont really need those big salaries do paramounts or universals i mean sure ken lay has an easy job but how difficult is it for an exec honcho in century city to sit at a desk and greenlight another john travolta flop every couple of months i mean surely the guy could do the job on oh two five zero zero zero a year and thatd be good for conservation cause hed have to give up the merc and the cherokee and the learjet and take the bus and how about travolta instead of two zero million per picture maybe he could get by on just two or three and the remaining one seven million could be put into those renewable energy projects hes so keen on i mean a two zero million salary isnt just swinelike its piggish right since its entry into the union california has had what we one nine thcentury imperialists call responsible government tristan da cunha doesnt yet its community leaders are behaving far more maturely and responsibly than californias gray davis is acting not like the elected governor of an american state but the appointed governor of a crown colony feverishly cabling head office to send somebody out to rescue him youre on your own man and if california conservationists find rolling blackouts too onerous they should try spending a week in the dark cut off from the outside world and knowing that even when the radio starts working again its going to take months for the secondhand xray machine to arrive,04:13:00,No

djcustomclipsdjinteractivecom mailtodjcustomclipsdjinteractivecom sent friday august two four two zero zero one one two two two pm to one six eight eight four two mailmanenroncom subject rahil jafry power points skilling moves on to charities family power points skilling moves on to charities family by mark golden zero eight two four two zero zero one dow jones energy service copyright c two zero zero one dow jones company inc new york dow jones jeff skilling will be spending the next few years working with charities in houston and spending time with family the former chief executive of enron corp ene said in an interview the four seven yearold skilling who resigned abruptly from enron after the companys board meeting aug one four repeatedly said he had left as stated for personal reasons wall street has been skeptical of the explanation and several analysts have said theyre waiting for the other shoe to drop the companys stock price fell one four in response to the announcement last week a loss of about four five billion in shareholder value and hasnt recovered this week but the former chief executive said the stock price will recover once investors see that his departure isnt a precursor to more bad news for the company ive spent the last three four years working really hard said skilling who requested the interview with dow jones newswires there are a lot of things that i havent been doing personal interests spending time with family there are a number of charitable things that i havent spent the time on that i believe i should i dont mean fundraising but hands on getting out and doing things building houses helping individuals skilling who has been involved with a multiple sclerosis charity for years said he plans to get involved in promoting the city of houston its massively underrated as a place to work and live he said its a great city and i think i can do a lot to get that across though insistent that there is nothing more to his departure than personal reasons skilling said little to reveal why a talented executive would surrender the top spot of the countrys largest energy trading company just six months after taking the job skilling had been enrons no two executive from one nine nine seven until this year and hes generally credited with the success of enrons wholesale trading operations which comprise about eight zero of the parents earnings he confirmed theres no crisis in his family and his health is fine skilling who assumed the chief executive title on feb one two also denied that he was suffering under the strain of the job late last week chairman kenneth lay and other enron executives in new york told wall street analysts that skilling had been going kind of nuts under the pressure of being chief executive one analyst said its not true that i was cracking up he said do i sound like someone who is cracking up the representation of me as thickskinned is a reasonable representation when asked if his departure could have been handled more smoothly so as not to alarm investors skilling said that perhaps the mechanics could have been better but said that is hindsight we thought it through and thought we were going about it in the right way he said i dont know what we could have done differently it will turn out in retrospect fine as soon as people see that theres nothing else about one weeks notice the former chief executive totally disagreed with speculation in this column last week that enron chairman kenneth lay who immediately resumed the role of chief executive may have wanted to regain daytoday control of the company and pushed skilling out i think the world of ken you cant find a bigger fan of his than me he said i was not forced out personal and family reasons are one zero zero of the story i guess its kind of mundane and im sorry it doesnt have as much drama and suspense as a lot of people would like it to have but thats what the deal is skilling said he spoke with lay about wanting to do other things many times over the years the first serious discussion of his imminent departure came about a week before the announcement said skilling whose recollection of his giving notice to lay was somewhat cloudy the board knew what was going on and that was the point the aug one four board meeting where the decisions were going to be made he said the decisions i guess to accept my resignation skilling said enron refused to release a copy of the minutes of the aug one four board meeting which was regularly scheduled the company doesnt generally release boardmeeting minutes spokeswoman karen denne said the former chief executive continues to work as a paid adviser to enron a clause in his contract prevents him from competing with the company through the end of two zero zero three and he has no plans to work outside the energy industry that might sound like a big comedown from running the countrys most aggressive energy company but skilling said the move fits some people say well you were working and aspiring so long to become ceo of enron thats not true i was working to build a business and we did said skilling who is credited with transforming the company into a trading powerhouse the company i built is doing great my life is moving on he also said the company will do fine without him some analysts have expressed concern about enrons ability to retain its top talent skillings predecessor as enrons no two executive richard kinder for example left the company in one nine nine six after lay announced that he would be retaining the chief executive spot for another five years kinder went on to buy enrons small liquids pipeline business and turned that company into kindermorgan inc kmi enrons current management skilling said has a very deep bench for example he described enron energy services chief executive dave delaney as awesome dave created the canadian business in enron skilling said by mark golden dow jones newswires two zero

re gas industry settlement to signatories to the comprehensive settlement alj biren has given us until friday of this week april two eight two zero zero zero to file errata to the comprehensive settlement so far i am planning to make the following nonsubstantive changes one the table of contents was seriously messed up by an automatic update feature in word just before we duplicated and filed i will be putting it back to the state you saw in the final draft two on pseven section one one two put a period at the end of the last sentence three on pnine section one one three one two thirds of the way down the page i will be changing subject to adjustment annual by the base rate pbr formula to subject to adjustment annually by the base rate pbr formula four on ptwo seven section one five four in the third full paragraph on the page i will be changing if only one customer has an ofo day to if only one customer class has an ofo day five also on ptwo seven section one five four bottom line on the page i will be filling in the blank with c so it reads appendix c in the category of maybe substantive one on pone zero section one one three two three lines from the bottom of the page the date october one two zero zero zero would be changed to october one two zero zero one this sentence refers to including the cost of backbone transmission for core customers buying gas from socalgas in the procurement rate obviously our intent was to do that only once we had unbundled backbone transmission which happens on october one two zero zero one in the category of substantive one our capacity term sheet had said that we would unbundled additional nonreliability storage for ctas effective upon implementation of the settlement see pfour the filed settlement managed to drop the section that provided for this option for ctas prior to the principal storage change on april one two zero zero one the filed settlement is ok for the period starting april one two zero zero one so to be consistent with the term sheet we need to insert something back into the settlement to allow ctas to opt out of nonreliability storage in the period from the effective date nine zero days after approval to april one two zero zero one obviously this may not be a very long period john leslie has suggested inserting at the very beginning of section five four four three in the partial storage year beginning on the effective date of this settlement agreement andcontinue with current text we would need to cover as part of implementation filings the exact mechanismpricing for socalgas purchasing gas in storage owned by ctas if they opt out of nonreliability storage prior to april one two zero zero one socalgas and sdge are ok with johns language and want to make sure it is ok with

four seven pm et url httpwwwthestreetcompcommentonthelevelone three two two two three zero html httpwwwthestreetcompcommentonthelevelone three two two two three zero html sometimes you just have to smile take for instance tonights king of comedy level three communicationslvltnasdaq perhaps the most aggressive of the big moneylosing telecommunications service providers floating on a sea of debt last year the company lost one five billion after taxes there are questions about its longterm financial health and through it all level three s management continues to reassure investors that the company is fully funded to get to breakeven investors in this beatenup stock naturally find such assurances soothing they shouldnt late last month level three filed to sell three billion in new debt securities preferred and common stock to finance working capital and capital expenditures companies that are fully funded do not typically serve notice that they may need to borrow another three billion to pay bills and make the investments required to stay in business level three matters to investors for a number of reasons first because it represents the entire new era telco sector which has seen more speculative money thrown at it than any other hightech sector in the past five years and that is saying something if level three runs into financial trouble you can bet a lot of other telco services companies will too and second if a slowmotion liquidity crisis hits the sector it will not be good news for related industries such as telecom equipment semiconductor manufacturers and contract manufacturers as bad as the news has been for these industries already if telecom continues to roll over the news could get worse thats for all you folks looking for the bottom in tech level three is also worth paying attention to because there is a staggering amount of money at risk here are a few relevant numbers the companys market capitalization is about one zero billion it carries seven three billion in debt it has about four billion in cash that it plans to spend real soon by yearend cumulative capital expenditures will reach one three billion to one four billion which is a lot of money for a company that went public only in one nine nine eight by two zero one zero cumulative cap ex is expected to top four zero billion global networks dont come cheap you know you might reasonably ask will level three even get to two zero zero three let alone two zero one zero the answer may hinge on whether the company is as fully funded as it claims to be last november this column raised questions about level three s claims to be fully funded company management was not pleased robin miller level three s vice president for investor relations wrote in the fact is that level three is one of the few emerging communications companies to be fully funded level three is fully funded through free cash flow breakeven at which point we are obviously selffunding well on jan one eight of this year fully funded level three filed its three billion shelf offering the stock lost one seven zero a share that day to close at four five three zero today it closed at two six five six today we tried to reach miller by phone to ask why a fully funded company like level three would file a three billion shelf offering she was unavailable but level three s director of media relations paul lonnegren was he said that the three billion filing doesnt necessarily mean that the company has any intentions or plans to raise the money it doesnt mean that we are going to go back to the market for more cash we are confident we can get to cashflow breakeven without having to get more money from the market we project cash flow breakeven by two zero zero four we did not file to raise more money in case we are not fully funded it was in case the markets bounce back positively enough to make the cost of money attractive of course there are no signs of that happening no there isnt any sign of the financial markets opening up for the likes of level three anytime soon there was a brief moment in january when the junk bond market eased a bit for highrisk borrowers that was when level three filed but today if level three wanted to raise money in the debt market it would have to pay north of one five if it could get the money at all the idea that level three can ease its debt payment problems by borrowing another three billion at one five to two zero is laughable such new debt would be more expensive than existing debt and according to the january registration statement the company already had deficiencies of earnings to fixed charges of nine nine seven million for the nine months ended september three zero two zero zero zero if level three adds more debt its debtservice costs simply go up that much more lehman brothers convertible debt analyst ravi suria wrote in a report last year that a company is fullyfunded only if it has enough cash to last it to a point when it becomes capable of paying at least the fixed charges from internally generated operating cash flow or ebitda by this measure level three is not fully funded if the company were it would not have filed to borrow another three billion to fund operating expenses and the buildout of its network level three management can say anything it wants about the company being fully funded

excellent editorials in todays wsj attached the following should be the key messages one the show was an aimless wander through the wellworn territory of blamegame politics with a healthy dose of fear mongering thrown in two it should not surprise anyone that two berkleybased journalists working in conjunction with the new york times would ignore econ one zero one and suggest that the solution for californias energy crisis is to subject the entire nation to roosevelt era new deal regulations such pinings have been abandoned over the past six five years but if the new york times wants to stake out that position fine it will probably help sharpen the debate and set up a clear victory for the market when supply comes onstream and prices moderate much sooner than the decades of legal wrangling to return to new deal regulations three the show completely ignored the failings of californias political and regulatory leadership to moderate or even eliminate the crisis when they had a chance four of the electricity consumed in california less than one five percent is generated by companies headquartered in texas more than five zero percent of the electricity in california is generated by municipal entities that have been charging the same high prices as the texas pirates these good pirates include the bonneville power administration the los angeles department of water and power the government of british columbia and the sacramento municipal utility district business world californias ship of fools by holman w jenkins jr zero six zero six two zero zero one the wall street journal atwo seven copyright c two zero zero one dow jones company inc lamenting the politicians lot in profiles in courage john f kennedy wrote that in no other occupation is it expected that a man will sacrifice honors prestige and his chosen career on a single issue of course no politician would last long if he didnt blow with the wind nine times out of one zero but on the tenth occasion even california has the right to expect some courage we dont know what happens when an advanced economy like californias suffers day after day of blackouts we may be about to find out modern office architecture becomes uninhabitable without airconditioning and elevators old people and asthmatics may die in the heat so may drivers at unlit traffic crossings steps could still be taken to lessen the blackouts but voters wouldnt know the difference and its so much easier to cast blame gov gray davis prates about a war with texas and who knows what secret failures as a human being led bill lockyer the attorney general to threaten enrons ken lay with homosexual rape in the california prison system california has found itself singularly lacking in heroes in its hour of crisis mr lockyer and mr davis harp on price but the true problem is the unavailability of power at any price to meet the demand that exists under the current structure of retail rates both must know the solution they noisily advocate federal price controls slapped across western electricity markets wouldnt bring power into existence to close the gap their proposal would simply saddle the feds with the dirty job of apportioning blackouts from californias mistakes across half a dozen other states in california itself municipal utilities in santa clara palo alto and other towns have already announced they wont participate in rolling blackouts the los angeles department of water and power certainly isnt volunteering why should voters in other states why not just cut the lines and let california monopolize the darkness a state review board in washington has already vetoed a proposed plant rather than suffer local pollution for power destined for california mr davis knows this he knows price controls would create a new problem without solving the shortages meanwhile the specter nobody wants to talk about is the state of california itself headed for bankruptcy if it continues to be willing to pay any price to satisfy the demand of consumers shielded from the true cost of power mr daviss version of the big lie is that texas is to blame texas companies account for just one two of californias supply having bought seven zero zero zero of the two zero zero zero zero megawatts that local utilities were forced to sell under deregulation being in the right place at the right time has always been profitable but any windfall has been spread widely among suppliers of gas pipeline capacity storage and ancillary services take enron its revenues quadrupled in the past year but so did its costs and profits are up only three one a leaked california memo names as two of the biggest gougers bc hydro owned by canadian taxpayers and the us bonneville power administration their sin was letting their reservoirs fill up overnight while meeting local needs with spotmarket power so they could sell their own production for higher prices to california during the day these are precisely efforts that might stop if price controls were imposed across the west making the shortages worse probably much worse northwestern smelters might be better off reclaiming the cheap hydro theyve been passing on to california three zero zero zero megawatts enough for two million homes farmers could resume irrigating seattle tacoma boise and other neighbors have all done what california has failed yet to do hiking rates to curb demand rather than emulate them gov daviss peacock of an energy czar david freeman babbles about public power the answer to a question nobody asked the solution to a nonexistent problem prices of electricity and natural gas for future delivery are already falling as investors race to build new plants and pipelines to meet the states future needs markets foresee the crisis ending without mr freemans antique new deal schemes whats been missing while folks like him ride their hobby horses though is the courage to take steps necessary to minimize the suffering this summer one large source of untapped power is californias own small generators known as qualifying facilities their fee scale is set by the state but california couldnt even summon the political competence to keep them in business so three zero zero zero megawatts sit idle people have tried to attach all kinds of ideological baggage to the california mess but we wouldnt be here if water flows in the columbia river system werent down five four from normal last summer californias fossilfuel generators increased their output by a whopping six two to make up the shortfall mostly by running existing plants harder yes there have been flaky prices partly because mysteriously california continues to use a discredited computer program to book a large chunk of its power one hour in advance but the flaky prices also represent a system pulling out all stops to save california from itself we said back in december theres only one solution jack up rates to stop consumers trying to burn more power than the state can beg borrow or steal the only question was when gov davis would find the courage hard to believe but the price hikes his regulators approved in march are still on the drawing board and busily being watered down someone should point out to gov davis that the author of profiles in courage wasnt endorsing career suicide but suggesting that politicians must husband their leadership for times when it really counts not a few people in public life understand this al gore openly yearned for the day when he could justify the compromises and trimming hes done in his life but mr davis is perhaps too lost in the dark to understand he is blowing the whole reason to have a political career what borders on the stupefying though is the failure of any other californian of prominence to step forward and speak truth about the power crisis by all rights gov davis should be a political leper yet he actually stands a microscopic chance of being reelected because of the sheer poverty in a state of three four million people of the republican opposition arnold schwarzenegger is looking better all the time copyright two zero zero zero dow jones company inc all rights reserved review outlook editorial california squeaks by zero six zero six two zero zero one the wall street journal atwo six copyright c two zero zero one dow jones company inc the california energy crisis is now more than a year old and governor gray davis has done nothing but squeak at it at first he attacked outofstate power generators for being pirates and marauders but lately he has focused on ferc and president bush demanding that the federal government place price caps on the sale of wholesale power hes even rustled up one zero economists including the dad of deregulation alfred kahn to support him well as most everybody knows including the economists who have come out in favor of them price caps dont work if caps are set too low as politics often dictate existing supply will shrink and demand will grow making the situation worse even correctly set price caps will discourage additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand the usual result is an aggravation of shortages and rationing indeed the history of price caps particularly during the energy crisis in the early one nine seven zero s when oil prices were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long bears this out the propricecaps argument however is a clever one it rests on the notion that there is no effective competition in the california energy market according to one of the one zero propricecap economists paul joskow at mit the energy market in california is characterized by inelastic demand and very very tight supplies which conspire to produce at certain times prices above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions mr joskow examined the california energy market during the summer of two zero zero zero looking at market fundamentals the broad forces determining supply and demand he found that two five to three zero of the wholesale prices of electricity during june july and august cannot be explained by market fundamentals and should be attributed to market imperfections as an argument for price caps this is hardly overwhelming especially since there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no further than market fundamentals such as the fact that the price of the most important input for almost half the electricity generated in california natural gas has been rising over the past year such as the fact that natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity thus bidding up the price to transmit such as the fact that the worst drought in the northwest in six zero years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market putting even more demands on natural gas generation such as the fact that imports into the state which were running two zero and up to two five during peak usage have declined and the fact that the price of tradable permits for nox emissions which must be held by plants generating electricity has skyrocketed not least the fact that demand in california during the past several years unfettered by rate increases has zoomed dramatically at any rate electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country indeed californias neighbors the states of washington idaho wyoming arizona nevada oregon utah and montana have had to bump up utility rates three zero to five zero so where is the tablet of stone saying that california with its especially restrictive environmental regulations should be any different the bad news for california is that poor dears it cant be different market fundamentals like supply and demand rule but thats also the good news high wholesale prices and necessary profits have done their job they have brought forth a number of suppliers in the form of more than a dozen plans for significant new generating plants in fact plans have even been announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines too demand has started to abate peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen four to nine from last year doubtless a response to a temporary one zero rate hike in january and the california public utilities commissions decision in march to finally really really raise rates by as much as five zero on average the details of that plan were announced in may and rate increases will show up on this months bills so californias blameshifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes over the market is working and imposing price caps would not only interrupt that process but would be unnecessary of course there is a painful lag between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market remedies of increased supply and lower demand and california will probably feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and blackouts but in the long run the market will be successful in creating new supply and lower prices unfortunately californias energy glut will probably come too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery ultimately we have to hope californians will understand it is their politics that has served them poorly copyright two zero zero zero dow jones company inc all rights reserved,04:32:00,No

competition in the nations two two zero billion wholesale power market enron corp is growing impatient from the us supreme court to congress and the federal energy regulatory commission the houstonbased energy and commodities trading giant has spread its openmarket gospel five years ago we clearly thought we would be much farther along than we are now rick shapiro enrons managing director of government affairs told reuters in an interview on friday finishing the job of making wholesale markets work across the us is our number one objective shapiro said enron has a large stake in the regulatory debate with wideranging commodity positions from lumber to pulp to bandwidth oil and natural gas its strategy hinges on the ability to transfer those products from buyer to seller more cheaply and quickly than its competitors for the power market that means enron needs easy access to electric transmission lines the interstate highway system that allows it to wheel supplies between regions and capitalize on shortterm price imbalances utilities block competition enrons big problem traditional utilities own transmission lines and have shaped the rules to block new entrants and favor their own generation shapiro said vertically integrated monopolies have been very effective in delaying wholesale competition across the board he said in its pleas to supreme court justices and regulators enron has tried to empower federal regulators to force utilities to open their wires to competition the supreme court last week heard oral arguments in a case that could be a watershed for the us power industry and decide whether ferc has the right to drive competition on state transmission networks in a classic battle of state versus federal jurisdictional turf enron wants the court to give ferc more authority to compel states to open their transmission grids to competitors meanwhile new york has brought a companion case that says ferc has gone too far and the court should give control of transmission wires back to the states this is an example of an agency that has overstepped its bounds lawrence malone general counsel for the new york state public service commission said at the oral argument new york wants the court to revoke fercs authority to regulate retail sales contending electricity involved in such sales stays within state boundaries and is not subject to federal legislation i think a victory for new york would be absolutely disastrous for consumers across the country shapiro said ferc has jurisdiction all they need to do is exercise it shapiro said echoing enron lawyers case to supreme court justices that existing laws give ferc the power to do enrons will enron does not see a recent congressional push for energy legislation as key to its plans shapiro said ferc is doing its job on the electricity front im not sure that legislation is required on that front ferc shows promising signs with new chairman pat wood at the helm ferc is moving in the right direction to drive competition shapiro said its early in his tenure shapiro said of wood many of the signs are promising wood has made socalled regional transmission organizations a high priority and set aggressive agency rules to drive utilities to join them rtos establish common rules that allow utilities to smoothly trade bulk electricity across the borders of their own local transmission systems enron sees rtos as a positive step toward competition in what he called a carrots and sticks approach wood signaled in late september that utilities must either join rtos or face losing the right to sell power in wholesale markets ferc will hold a weeklong meeting on rtos beginning monday enron is skeptical that carrots are useful and is a bigger fan of sticks shapiro said utilities have gotten quite fat over the last nine or one zero years shapiro said and will shrug off fercs incentives im not sure there are a sufficient number of carrots in the world right now to incentivize these companies shapiro said copyright two zero zero zero dow jones company inc all rights reserved uk enrons european electricity trading volumes soar one zero one two two zero zero one

gross head of lme metals at spectron futures ltd ukbased energy and commodities broker spectrons electronic platform for the trading of london metal exchange lme contracts has become required viewing for traders alongside the lmes own system lme select and the enron groups enrononline i think weve proved that people will trade lme derivatives contracts online because there are some great advantages to doing so gross told reuters in a telephone interview and unlike the physical markets where things havent really taken off online all three platforms are pretty much indispensable to the market both spectron and lme select are neutral platforms in which category one and category two lme members trade with each other while enrononline is open to a wider membership but has enron itself as the sole counterparty in each transaction this leaves a gap in the market for a multiparty trading system open to industry participants beyond the immediate trading community gross suggested i think the clear trend for metals derivatives trading for the future is for open platforms which would allow dealers and clients in the market to interact with each other online he said direct access for clients to an electronic trading environment could mean changes in the role of the broker he said clients will have the advantage of more control more visibility and more transparency in what they do however theyll have to pay for services gross said you could see a situation where dealers specialise in different areas certain dealers would provide credit functions certain institutions would provide clearing others would provide execution and certain companies would provide marketmaking difficult conditions difficult market conditions are already forcing metals traders to rethink their activities this week alone has seen nm rothschild sons exit base metals trading and both bank of nova scotia and enron looking to scale back on the lme now youve got low volumes falling volatilities falling prices and were in the grips of a bear market its very very poor for business in general gross said there are too many dealers around chasing a shrinking amount of businesseach company is going to have to look very carefully at their business and their staffing levels spectron has not been immune from declining volumes our volumes for the first one two months of operation were fantastic way beyond what we had expected however our volumes have fallen in the recent quarter gross said thats due to two factors first the overall market activity is lower and second lme select has managed to attract some of the business that we would previously have had one zero zero percent of the company is now looking at ways to further develop its trading platform were beginning to investigate ways to add certain features and do things differently that might involve creating an alternative platform where clients could access prices and thereby widen the service gross said but he stressed we have to keep the interests of our dealer clients foremost uncertainty in the current environment the lmes refusal to throw its weight behind either openoutcry floor trade or its new screen system the exchange has taken pains not to express any preference and to allow the market to decide may prove to be counterproductive gross said by having two systems running side by side the exchange is almost moving in two totally different directions he said theres a feeling that the ring is doomed which doesnt do anything to encourage its use while the reluctance to fully back electronic trading means that youre still only seeing a trickle of business going through select in terms of overall volumes while preferences vary in different sectors of the market the current uncertainty is helping noone he said metals traders just want to trade they just want to know with some kind of certainty how the market will be structured in future so they can structure their business to support

served on enron power marketing inc epmi enron energy services operations inc and enron energy services inc collectively referred to as ees enron energy marketing corporation eemc and portland general electric corporation portland generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the enron entities harvey i am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and phone calls between michael day on behalf of the enron entities and yourself during the past few weeks here is the current status as we understand it based upon the agreements we reached between october six two zero zero zero and october one eight two zero zero zero date of your confirming email the enron entities have made the following document productions in response to the subpoenas served by california public utilities

five five zero zero zero wholesale transactions responsive to request nos seven to one one one three to one seven and one nine we believe with these productions we have complied with the october six one eight th agreement with respect to portland general and eeseemc as you know these productions were all made reserving the enron entities rights to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses we originally had hoped to have all of the transactional data for epmi as defined in our october six th email available for production by october two seven th however we were also mindful of your expressed expectation that any data provided be useful and reliable the collection of data you requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same location nor organized as you requested it in fact during our review of some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information when it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved we informed you of the problem we now understand that if we cannot give you a firm date when the balance of the transactional data will be available the commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to compel production before the federal regulatory energy commission ferc we understand the pressure that you must be under to get data immediately but we cannot at this time give you another date in the immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce accurate data moreover during the iterim between october one eight th and today a number of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas served on the enron entities first we understand that many other parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very sound legal grounds second the commission itself has without a hearing on the motion unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes sought by other parties served third the commission has filed its motion before ferc seeking an order compelling the production of the data from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited hearing and production schedule we note that the reasons stated in the motion before ferc as the basis for the production are materially different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application to the commissions own administrative law judge who issued the subpoenas finally ferc itself has completed its investigation and has issued a tentative order as of november one two zero zero zero originally the enron entities had been prepared to accept most favored nation treatment with respect to protective orders and requests by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that was available however given both the commissions stated urgent need for an immediate answer that epmi cannot in good faith give despite substantial effort date for production of reliable and accurate transaction data and the uncertainty created by the above described intervening events epmi believes it has no choice but to serve its formal objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the commissions threatened motion to compel before ferc we also understand from our discussions with you that the commission has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been served with subpoenas we understand that there is a list for those entities that have been cooperating a list for those who have been delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their rights to challenge the subpoenas we understand that the commission intends to punish by whatever means it has available those entities that object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas we deplore these tactics but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described above we understand that epmi may in fact be moved from the cooperating list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights if you have and questions or comments please do

 R,escompte et de Placement (BAREP)",there have been a lot of emails being circulated internally about barep and from barep the current situation as i understand it is that ectric the oslo branch of

although it is not clear to me how this split structure will come into play for the transactions each of the enron entities may be interested in pursuing barep is prepared to sign isda master agreements with both ena and ectric and is actively looking to start negotiations from a credit and legal perspective it is our preference to have only one enron entity enter into a master with barep if ectric is the entity that will have the most contact with barep then it makes sense to have ectric enter into the isda with barep to the extent that ena would like to trade with barep i would propose that ectric enter into the trade directly with barep and then have ectric either back to back the trade to ena or otherwise account for the transaction back to ena pending execution of a master each enron entity should continue to document transactions as they have been doing if this proposal makes sense to the rest of you i will need to know if it works from a regulatory and tax perspective steve janine is there any reason why ena would not be able contact the traders at ectric to have them enter into a transaction with barep and then have them back to back the transaction to

think that were are in the market just to grab the physical business left with cards in hand and future risk management meetings in mind big buyers eg ge emerson and consultants eg accenture mck etc were particularly receptive and should be courted as public advocates for what we are doing jeff original message from thomas sfikasenronenronxgateenron mailtoimceanotesthomastwo zero sfikas_enronfour

six two zero zero one yesterday during the panel v discussion why have steel middlemen gone from the most threatened to best positioned we got some direct feedback on the perception of enron in the marketplace the participants were fred lamesh ceo of trademarked inc michael siegel ceo of olympic steel bud siegel ceo of russell metals and wilfred von bulow ceo of ferrostaal inc the moderator was peter marcus managing partners of world steel dynamics each participant gave a brief speech about their respective companies which was followed by a qa session the first mention of enron was during michael siegals speech in which he mentioned that olympic steel had sold material to enron and that enron has recognized that steel is a commodity and for many countries represents currency michael was clearly proud of his transactions with enron and agreed with our view of steel as a commodity the real feedback came during the qa peter marcus posted the following question to the panelists what about enron with their plan of entering the market with a number of hubs across the country stocking material with large scale distribution on a spot basis will this business model work do they offer any real value or not following are the respective responses as best i can reiterate from my notes please dont quote me on this fred lamesh tradearbed the concept is too new to make a judgment yet on credibility enron has certainly been successful in the past and should not be discounted i question their ability to procure material at competitive enough levels to make this a profitable venture but there may be some value in their delivery of financial instruments michael siegal olympic steel enron certainly has the financial means to withstand a break even business to support their financial instruments at this point we view them as just another entity in the market and until we can evaluate their performance it is difficult to determine value i am concerned though that they will prop up under capitalized distributors and allow them to operate despite mismanagement one interesting and unique concept that they are trying to bring to the industry though is the idea that a contract is a contract with liquidated damages for non performance that would certainly be change sporadic laughter among the crowd bud siegel russell metals i addressed the enron question last night during dinner and was told that i was abusive to the young lady from enron tammy i later understood that you had a less than cordial conversation with bud the previous evening i am calling enron the hunts of the steel business with their idea of buying up the market the whole concept is like swiss cheese you can not put up depots buy from steel mills and expect to sell the same steel to distributors cheaper than the mills themselves the logistical expenses alone guarantee failure you can not be everything to everyone considering the current state of under financing in this industry they will inevitably end up financing bankrupt people and take credit hits without immediate success enron has been known to exist markets quickly in the past and i believe they will be gone within the yearsome sporadic applause wilfried von bulow ferrostaal right now they are just another additional player in the market they will certainly have an impact but it would not be pragmatic to make a judgment yet on their ability to succeed lets watch it and see if there is any value to what they are trying to bring to the market it appears to me that the focus on enron in the market right now continues to be more on the physical aspects of what we are doing and not enough emphasis or credibility is being given to the financial tools we are bringing it is obviously very easy to poke holes in a concept of trading large volumes of physical steel on a spot basis through the set up of physical hubs around the country in the end the only way we will be successful will be by bringing liquidity to our index through financial instruments we need to focus more on educating customers about our financial tools developing our curve and bringing players to the market,09:03:00,No

keithrogasoucstatetxus subject ercot protocols february one six two zero zero one public utility commission of texas sent via email commissioners once again i thank you for the courtesy of including me in yesterdays puct workshop on the ercot protocols it has been my experience that such open discussion of market design issues with full pursuit of any problematic features is essential in achieving a successful electricity market unfortunately the subject is complex and the details matter it is not possible to anticipate every problem but the evidence shows that ignoring obvious problems in the hope that the rules can be easily adapted has not been a successful strategy this makes what you are doing all the more important on reflection after the workshop i am more concerned about the argument that emerged about the role of the iso in many instances to explain away problems of the type identified by shmuel oren an argument was made that some administrative rule along with discretionary choices of the iso would counteract perverse incentives created by the pricing system if this argument were correct it would seem to place a substantial burden on the iso to undo what the pricing incentives have done when faced with such conditions in california and elsewhere the iso developed a more and more intrusive role in what became less and less of a market to make this unhappy practice part of the official design to the point that the iso is expected to ignore the information in schedules and do what is right would seem to be especially problematic at a minimum it would make the iso responsible for any difficulties that develop without giving the iso the market tools to avoid the problems commissioner wood asked at what point how a coordinated spot market would differ from the ercot protocols we pursued the most important featureeliminating the balanced schedule requirementbut did not have time to pursue all the other details the presentation i handed out contains a summary of the key features on page two zero after the workshop i received an email with a recent presentation by john chandley a colleague of mine that addresses the issues of market design with a focus on california as i indicated in austin there are important differences between ercot and california but on the matter of wholesale market design there is a great deal in common such as requiring balanced schedules relying on congestion zones applying different treatment for different kinds of congestion using ad hoc pricing rules and so on johns summary of the recommended reforms for california would apply in large part to the ercot protocols i have attached a copy of this presentation for your information i remain both impressed with all that you have accomplished to date and worried that fundamental assumptions in the market design will recreate problems that we have seen elsewhere my recommendation to adopt a coordinated spot market more like pjm wont solve all problems but it would go a long way whatever the difficulty now it will be much harder to fix these problems later furthermore the coordinated spot market role for the iso is much more robust if the simplifying assumptions of the ercot protocols are true which i doubt the coordinated spot market will end up looking much like the zonal model with a few constraints and easy bilateral trading but if the ercot assumptions are wrong the ercot protocols will face serious problems and the coordinated spot market would be a solution furthermore we now know from experience that the coordinated spot market is neither more complicated nor more expensive than the alternatives the sooner you make a commitment in texas to adopt this successful market design the better i offer these further remarks as i did my comments yesterday in the hope that you succeed i would be happy to discuss these matters further as you decide best regards william w hogan seven nine john f kennedy street cambridge ma zero

 PROBLEMS",ferc commissioners pledge to address californias power market problems during and after emotional hearings san diego electricity consumers express their frustrations zero nine two zero two zero zero zero foster electric report page two c copyright two zero zero zero foster associates inc two days of hearings in san diego calif on the causes of this summers significant electricity price increases in southern california and other problems with californias competitive markets revealed much hand wringing and finger pointing but the answer to the question of whether and how the market should be fixed proved elusive nevertheless all four ferc commissioners attending the hearings agreed that the commission needs to be part of the solution commenting on his impressions of the discussions earlier in the week chairman james hoecker conceded at the commissions regular sept one four meeting that it will not be sufficient simply to sprinkle deregulation dust on the old monopoly costofservice environment there will be no magical solution to the problems he added the causes are complex and involve both wholesale and retail service and state and federal regulatory responsibilities nevertheless hoecker said that ferc now has a better understanding of the plight of the inhabitants of southern california and is cognizant of the sentiment of everyone that the commission should not study the issue to death accordingly he said that ferc would work with the california public utilities commission cpuc the state attorney generals office and the governor to do what is necessary with respect to wholesale electric market design and to maintain california as an attractive market for investment high prices market uncertainty and a long transition to competition in my view are not sustainable hoecker added but he discouraged the apparently spreading view of some parties that this is the beginning of the end for competitive electricity markets i personally reject that notion not just as a matter of policy but as a practical matter he predicted that fixing the problems will simply take a lot of hard work the other commissioners similarly proclaimed their continuing commitment to the development of competitive electricity markets commissioner linda breathitt said incentives exist to act as soon as possible proclaiming that wholesale prices in california markets have not been just and reasonable commissioner william massey said that authorities should focus on how to provide shortterm relief while exploring the requisite longterm changes to the market structure commissioner curt hebert jr stressed the need to regard the implications on a wider scope beyond california californias symptoms reflect a systemic problem that can be rectified not a competitive problem per se hebert insisted the first san diego hearing was convened by the house commerce energy and power subcommittee on sept one one and californias house members appearing were quick to argue that generators were the main culprits behind prices that were as much as three times what they were last year the generators are playing games asserted rep bob filner dcalif they are robbing people of their livelihoods even threatening to murder peoples businesses thats criminal to me besides filner other house members attending the hearing were all republicans subcommittee chairman joe barton texas brian bilbray calif randy cunnigham calif duncan hunter calif ron packard calif and john shadegg ariz california representatives filner hunter and bilbray all called on ferc to roll back the wholesale rates being charged to san diegos electricity consumers bilbray and hunter also said they would support a bill hr five one three one introduced by filner see related article this report that would set the price for wholesale power sold in the western systems coordinating council region after june one two zero zero zero at no more than the average price for the preceding three years and would require refunds to ultimate consumers while skeptical about the need to order refunds hoecker said that the commission would take a new look at the issue his preliminary view is that californias high prices result primarily from a critical imbalance of supply and demand exacerbated by the wholesale market rules and structure once again hoecker called for enactment of federal restructuring legislation to reduce the uncertainty associated with deregulation which may be inhibiting investment in new generation and transmission capacity such legislation should address the need for comparable and open access to transmission facilities regional transmission organizations mandatory reliability rules and tools for remedying market power he told the panel currently hoecker said that californias market woes reveal fercs lack of the necessary tools to address market power effectively george sladoje president and ceo of the california power exchange capx said one of the main culprits in californias electric market woes was generators abandoning the capxs dayahead market in favor of the california independent system operators caisos more lucrative realtime market the shift of demand from the dayahead market to the realtime market exacerbated price volatility and contributed to the crisis atmosphere and it has been the most dominant cause of the significant supply reduction in the dayahead market sladoje said in written testimony he added that prices in markets outside california were more attractive to generators seeking longterm contracts leaving california buyers at the mercy of the realtime markets in the face of increased demand and decreased supply to give some perspective to this condition at times this summer the caiso realtime market expanded to include as much as two zero three zero percent of the total energy volumes although it was designed as a balancing market that would handle no more than about two percent sladoje added in defense of the generators jan smutnyjones executive director of the independent energy producers blamed the problems on the lack of retail competition combined with a shortfall in generation executives from enron corp and reliant energy faulted the state for requiring californias three investorowned utilities to purchase all their electricity from the px and for limiting their ability to hedge price risks by entering into longterm fixedprice contracts on sept one two ferc held a hearing of its own in san diego as part of its ongoing investigation elzero zero nine five into californias wholesale electricity markets see report noone nine nine pgthree to open the hearing hoecker acknowledged that san diego customers are hurting competition is about choice and these folks dont have choice however he also cautioned that federal intervention is at least six weeks away because he is reluctant to act before a commission staff report on californias electricity market is completed on nov one the commission will correct any market flaws or unlawful behaviors to the extent it has authority to do so hoecker said in prepared testimony for the house hearing held a day earlier however the commission is still investigating these markets when we have a sufficient record of market conditions the commission will take further action to address problems to the full extent of our jurisdiction hoeckers written testimony also lamented that ferc may lack the tools it needs to address market power while ferc can attach market power mitigation measures to approvals of utilities mergers or other corporate transactions he noted that this remedy does not address market power already built into current commercial and operational arrangements while the commission also can deny or revoke authorization for marketbased wholesale rates reimposing costbased rates would do little or nothing to promote efficiency or competition hoecker stated and in california where generation plants have recently been sold at well above book value costbased rates may not represent a real reduction commissioner massey however believes that ferc has enough information to act now to mitigate what he believes are unjust and unreasonable wholesale power rates being charged in california based on the records of proceedings at the commission this summer i believe that there are sufficient indications that california wholesale markets are not producing prices that are just and reasonable massey insisted in his written testimony for example california wholesale electricity costs for june two nine of this year were seven times what they were for the same date in one nine nine nine three four zero million vs four five million even though energy usage was only about three percent more during the month of june two zero zero zero the total cost of electricity energy and ancillary services combined charged to the california market was nearly half of californias total electricity cost for all of one nine nine nine i would also note that the california public utilities commission states that every analysis of the california markets since their opening has found substantial exercises of market power i believe that there are serious flaws in the california wholesale markets i am concerned that this summers events are causing a crisis of confidence in california wholesale electricity markets that threaten to erode the political consensus necessary to sustain a marketbased approach to regulation not just in california but across the country massey added in his oftenrepeated concerns the commission must act forcefully and decisively to reassure market participants policymakers and consumers that jurisdictional wholesale markets will produce consumer benefits and just and reasonable rates the commissions strongest advocate for open and free electricity markets commissioner heberts written testimony cautioned against labeling the current situation as simply a california or summer of two zero zero zero problem rather the problems that are now confronting southern california represent a manifestation of larger deeper problems that may confront other portions of the country in later months and years he insisted the problem hebert acknowledged is that easy fixes do not exist according to hebert rebates refunds and emergency releases may offer some relief right now however these shortterm bandages do nothing to mask the larger problem that surely will reemerge next summer and future summers until something is done to address the true underlying nature of the problem at bottom the situation in southern california demonstrates that the federal government in particular ferc can and should do much more to promote energy supply energy delivery and utility innovation there is no comprehensive energy strategy decisions are made on an expedient ad hoc basis with little regard for longterm impacts and policies made in one energy sector electricity natural gas oil etc fail to take into account their impact on other sectors what is needed is a new form of thinking most regulators claim to support competition but their decisions belie their stated intentions what regulators need to do is to demonstrate the courage of their convictions by allowing competition actually to operate by trusting that markets will make appropriate allocative decisions regulatory policies that claim to help consumers by inhibiting the operation of market forces such as through price controls actually work to their detriment heberts also pointed his finger at one sdge for failing to employ adequate risk management tools two the caiso for lacking the incentives and accountability to make difficult decisions necessary for the transition to competition while compromising its independence by bowing to political pressure three the cpuc for policies that fail to allow for the timely siting and construction of badlyneeded generation and for ignoring performancebased incentives and four ferc for sending inconsistent signals to energy suppliers and granting too much deference to the caiso finally commissioner breathitts prepared testimony stressed the need for federal and state officials to work together in exploring solutions since both have jurisdiction over different aspects of californias electricity markets,07:42:00,No

inexperienced chili taster named frank who was visiting texas from the east coast recently i was honored to be selected as an outstanding famous celebrity in texas to be a judge at a chili cookoff because no one else wanted to do it also the original person called in sick at the last moment and i happened to be standing there at the judges table asking directions to the beer wagon when the call came i was assured by the other two judges native texans that the chili wouldnt be all that spicy and besides they told me i could have free beer during the tasting so i accepted here are the scorecards from the event chili one mikes maniac mobster monster chili judge one a little too heavy on tomato amusing kick judge two nice smooth tomato flavor very mild frank holy cow what the hell is this stuff you could remove dried paint from your driveway with it took me two beers to put the flames out hope thats the worst one these texans are crazy chili two arthurs afterburner chili judge one smoky with a hint of pork slight jalapeno tang judge two exciting bbq flavor needs more peppers to be taken seriously frank keep this out of reach of children im not sure what i am supposed to taste besides pain i had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the heimlich maneuver they had to walkietalkie in three extra beers when they saw the look on my face chili three freds famous burn down the barn chili judge one excellent firehouse chili great kick needs more beans judge two a beanless chili a bit salty good use of red peppers frank call the epa ive located a uranium spill my nose feels like i have been snorting drano everyone knows the routine by now barmaid pounded me on the back now my backbone is in the front part of my chest im getting drunk chili four bubbas black magic judge one black bean chili with almost no spice disappointing judge two hint of lime in the black beans good side dish for fish or other mild foods not much of a chili frank i felt something scraping across my tongue but was unable to taste it sally the bar maid was standing behind me with fresh refills that three zero zero lb witch is starting to look hot just like this nuclearwaste im eating chili five lindas legal lip remover judge one meaty strong chili cayenne peppers freshly ground adding considerable kick very impressive judge two chili using shredded beef could use more tomato must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement frank my ears are ringing and i can no longer focus my eyes i farted and four people behind me needed paramedics the contestant seemed offended when i told her that her chili had given me brain damage sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher it really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming rednecks chili six veras very vegetarian variety judge one thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili good balance of spice and peppers judge two the best yet aggressive use of peppers onions and garlic superb frank my intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous sulfuric flames no one seems inclined to stand behind me except big sally i need to sooth my butt with a snow cone chili seven susans screaming sensation chili judge one a mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers judge two ho hum tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment i should note that i am worried about judge number three he appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably frank you could put a grenade in my mouth pull the pin and i wouldnt feel a damn thing ive lost the sight in one eye and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water my shirt is covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth my pants are full of lavalike stuff to match my damn shirt at least during the autopsy theyll know what killed me ive decided to stop breathing its too painful screw it im not getting any oxygen anyway if i need air ill just suck it in through the four inch hole in my stomach chili eight helens mount saint chili judge one a perfect ending this is a nice blend chili safe for all not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence judge two this final entry is a good balanced chili neither mild nor hot sorry to see that most of it was lost when judge number three passed out fell and pulled the chili pot on

shippers since gerrys group implemented the changes we have not been in a situation where a sba was called to come in or go out at an allocated point gerrys system requirements as to how the system

reyna subject re sba contracts michele im not sure the information is readily available if available at all tms data is only maintained without extraordinary measures for six months it is my recollection that there may have been an allocation at a point where sba gas was scheduled and when that occurred the standard allocation procedures were enforced i think once we asked the shipper to move the sba activity to another point but that was pre gisb unfortunately because of the how the sbas work the pack draft and peak points are negotiated in advance which limits the points to use also the two eight three zero hr lead time required for notification means that we have to anticipate what system conditions will become and therein use sbas to improve system conditions sometimes we miss the mark either cold weather does not materialize or moves in late or shipper activity increases and in hindsight an sba was not necessary reyna may have some additional insight in more recent sba activities original message from medeles gerry sent wednesday november one four two zero zero one two three one pm to winckowski michele bodnar michael blair lynn cc cabrera reyna subject re sba

november one four two zero zero one one three two pm to bodnar michael blair lynn cc cabrera reyna medeles gerry subject re sba contracts i guess the question is have we ever actually reviewed when we call on the sba volumes and what the system conditions have been during those periods we want to verify that we are not allocating a point when we have sba gas flowing theatrically we argue that we would not call on sbas if the gas was not needed to meet system requirements we want to verify that the theory and the actual match up i hope this makes sense thanks mw original message from bodnar

cc subject coalfired generation soaring natgas prices revive interest in coal december zero seven two zero zero zero three three one zero zero pm et by andrew kelly houston dec zero seven reuters soaring prices for natural gas and concerns about future supplies are prompting us electricity generators to take another look at coal which had fallen out of favor as gas dominated the nations plans for new power plants wisconsin electric started the ball rolling in september with plans to build two new six zero zero megawatt coalfired power plants the first to be announced in the united states in several years richard grigg president of the wisconsin energy corpwec unit said the decision was a simple matter of prudence and a way to avoid putting all of your eggs in one basket we believe that a strong diversity in your fuel mix is a very important part of having a reliable and low cost electricity supply grigg told reuters in an interview although coal accounts for just over half of us electricity production the economic and environmental advantages of modern gas turbines had made the decision about how to fuel new power plants something of a nobrainer in recent years consequently over nine zero percent of new plants currently planned in the united states are slated to burn natural gas but as natural gas prices soar hitting alltime highs of over nine per million british thermal units on the new york mercantile exchange this week grigg suspects that other power producers will also take another look at coal given increasing gas prices and concern for supply availability i think youre going to see more people look for ways to utilize coal grigg said back in the picture griff jones vicepresident of power trading at dynegy inc dyn said high natural gas prices and recent advances in clean combustion technology had put coal back in the picture a year or two ago people wouldnt bring up the subject of developing a coal plant today theres talk about it he said for dynegy which began as a natural gas marketer and has made the convergence of the natural gas and electric power businesses an article of faith that is quite an admission since the oil price explosions of the one nine seven zero s the share of oil used in us power generation has dwindled to around three percent nuclear plants deliver about two zero percent of the nations electricity but construction of new nuclear plants is widely viewed as politically impossible following the accidents at three mile island in one nine seven nine and at chernobyl in one nine eight six natural gas currently supplies about one five percent of us electricity but is projected to gain market share steadily due to power generators enthusiasm for the high efficiency and low emissions of the latest combinedcycle gas turbines oil and gas industry executives often cite projected growth in us demand for natural gas of three zero trillion cubic feet by two zero one zero much of it fueled by increased use of gas for power generation plans for new gasfired power plants are based on the assumption that the industry will be able to step up to the plate and deliver everincreasing amounts of gas flat gas production in recent years however us natural gas production has remained stubbornly steady around one nine billion cubic feet augmented by canadian imports of around three billion cubic feet the recent surge in gas prices has pushed the number of drilling rigs currently searching for gas in the united states to unprecedented levels of over eight zero zero from just over six zero zero a year ago but so far at least production remains more or less flat as gas producers fight the accelerating depletion of mature fields plans for a pipeline that would tap huge unexploited gas reserves in alaska will alleviate the supply situation but the gas would only start flowing in the second half of this decade coal on the other hand is abundant and readily available the united states has reserves equivalent to well over two zero zero years of domestic consumption ray niles an analyst with salomon smith barney estimated in a recent report that the united states will need three zero zero zero zero zero four zero zero zero zero zero megawatts of new electricity generating capacity over the next decade or somewhere between eight zero zero and one zero zero zero new plants natural gas producers would be hard pressed to supply enough fuel for even half of that new capacity he calculated therefore we think it likely that new coalfired generating capacity will also be necessary to meet demand growth niles wrote we see no alternative fuel capable of producing the necessary power due to political and time constraints wisconsin electrics grigg said it might not be long before other power generators followed his own companys lead and drew up plans for new coalfired plants i have heard some rumblings from others that are also recognizing that economics as well as supply

delay by mitchell stephens my wife is cold why is that throwing me after all we are soaking wet following a day of floating in and out of the raft through the succession of class one two and three rapids on the chagres river the river that feeds the panama canal weve been at it for about six hours now its getting late and the motorboat that was supposed to meet us and whisk us back to the van never showed so were paddling though we know its too far to paddle every once in a while one of the guides tries to get the radio to work and my wife who gets a chill at the mere thought of airconditioning is naturally understandably cold and uncomfortable and a little worried to boot but her attitude is throwing me the explanation can be found i suspect in something my friend jeff scher had said when i told him i was about to undertake this aroundtheworld journey try to view every delay he suggested as a gift this seemed initially an odd notion his example a trip to philadelphia he and a friend took during which a flat tire forced them to behold a lovely little town was interesting but not all that persuasive still i remembered what he said and delays certainly came first the battery on my toyota gave out in the belowzero temperatures just outside of kansas city i needed a jump and the guy in a beat up towncar parked next to mine was kind enough to provide one in return i was asked to give a couple of his acquaintances a lift somewhere a gift these were two guys from the deep south who would then be taking a bus into kansas city before spending twentysome hours on another bus to mississippi all this in order to see their wives and children on christmas i did take the opportunity to meet them as a gift then a half hour past matamoras mexico my daughter who had joined me for a stretch and i learned at a customs check that we were missing the necessary permits and had to go all the way back to the border a gift i found myself trying to see it that way and it is true that we ended up spending the night in a fine hotel in matamoras and strolling around the nicest part of that town twice on this trip i have been stuck in long lines of cars trucks and buses behind serious accidents on narrow mountain roads the first time it happened south of oaxaca in mexico i was delayed for around an hour and a half while i was waiting i chatted with some of the grayhaired members of a sixhousetrailer caravan spending three months traveling around mexico the second time north of san jose in costa rica the delay was more like three hours and i fell into an intense conversation with two dutch fellows who were almost finished with seven and fiveweek tours of central america i was getting good at this yes my plans were messed up no i didnt have a lot of extra time to waste trying to drive from new jersey to panama but remarkably i could get stuck without feeling put out at the heart of this newfound enlightenment was a kind of patience not an easy thing for a new yorker to muster plus an openness to whatever the fates held jeffs advice turned out to be another way of saying keep smiling keep your eyes open remember that one plan one schedule is often as good as another i believe it is good advice in fact i found myself wondering somewhere along the road about all the gifts i had missed because my one nine eight nine camry has been so reliable because the trip so far has gone relatively smoothly because my life so far has gone relatively smoothly which is why i am having so much trouble out here on the river i am deep into my semispiritual viewdelayasgift mode do you see that white hawk maybe well stop at an indian village for help my wife meanwhile here only for a short visit and therefore not practiced in such reveries
