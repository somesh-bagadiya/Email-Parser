constitution two zero zero zero worldnetdailycom ever since i saw al gore give that uncharacteristically statesmanlike speech defending the integrity of the electoral college system under the constitution of the united states ive been scratching my head trying to figure it out who was this guy was this the same al gore who has demonstrated time and time again so little respect for the constitution during the last eight years why was he giving up on the idea of a challenge to the electoral college when it seemed many in his camp were banking on that as their last line of defense well i think i have figured it out actually there are two possibilities the first thought that came to me was that this was al gores dontwatchthemanbehindthecurtain speech while he was extolling the virtues of the constitution his minions in florida from bill daley to jesse jackson were busy subverting it by any means necessary it was al gores way of establishing public plausible deniability he stood above the fray while his cohorts did the dirty work but more recently another thought has occurred to me a darker more sinister thought i hope i am wrong i pray that this time i am overestimating the deviousness of al gore but that of course is always a difficult task think for a moment why al gore would suddenly be reading and citing the constitution the answer is that in this instance it gives him all the power what do i mean who is it under the constitution that is specifically charged with certifying the electoral college votes of each state you guessed it the president of the us senate which also happens to be the vice president of the united states thats right the day those electoral college votes go to the senate to be counted and certified to choose the next president of these united states al gore will be holding all the cards oh farah you say you dont think al gore would tamper with the results in any way with the whole world watching do you well lets think about what has been happening in florida for the last several days al gores campaign managers have been whipping up hysteria stating that the will of the people in that state is being subverted they are filing lawsuits they are organizing marches they are all but accusing the bush campaign of voter fraud listen to what bill daley has to say more than one zero zero million americans voted on tuesday and more voted for al gore than george bush here in florida it also seems very likely that more voters went to the polls believing that they were voting for al gore than for george bush if the will of the people is to prevail al gore should be awarded a victory in florida and be our next president of the united states theyve decided that no matter what the actual vote count shows gore wins now all gore has to do on that fateful day in the us senate is reject for certification the electoral college votes of florida and he wins the majority and becomes president sorry bush fans i dont think theres a thing you can do about it other than protest complain and stomp your feet better start planning your legal strategy now ill bet al gores transition team is already hard at work barbra streisand is probably making plans to sing at the inauguration alec baldwin is unpacking his bags this could be a fait accompli i guarantee you a counter to this bold move is not in the bush campaigns playbook the gore campaign still working overtime has laid the groundwork for the challenge the florida vote is tainted they say its too close to call too many irregularities the vote can simply be dismissed by the constitutional authority vice president al gore would you put it past him i sure wouldnt joseph farah is editor and chief executive officer of worldnetdailycom and writes a daily

gray davis is searching for answers to californias energy crisis he also has been polling voters about potential solutions and trying to convince opinion leaders that he is taking decisive action interviews with davis pollster lawmakers and those on the receiving end of the publicity campaign offer a glimpse into the tight link between policy and politics as the governor negotiates a way out of the power crunch recently as independent polls showed that three in four californians believe the crisis is the states no one problem davis backed a bill that could lead to electricity rate increases after saying for months that he opposed them last week the governors office sent a statement titled meeting the energy challenge to nearly two zero zero zero opinion leaders and decision makers touting davis record and refuting the claims of critics that he has been too slow to act fortuna union high school district superintendent dennis hanson whose humboldt county office received one of the faxes was offended by what he saw as an attempt to manipulate him making it political provides no solutions said an angry hanson whose district is preparing for a utility bill that is potentially five zero zero zero zero higher this school year the unwillingness of anybody to take responsibility boggles my mind davis aides insist that the governor isnt preoccupied with the views of voters despite his political operation polling californians on the energy issue since last summer some critics suggest that davis fear of a public backlash has exacerbated his usual cautiousness and contributed to the energy crisis thats ridiculous said davis pollster paul maslin we do a lot less polling than anybody understands for significant periods of this entire issue there has not been polling going on its a far cry from the perception from recent white houses where everything must be polled the surveys of californians which are paid for by davis political campaign help frame issues and determine factors such as the publics willingness to conserve maslin said the responses are not used to guide intricate policy decisions he said at the same time however maslin explained that his polling shows residents clearly dont want electricity service left to the vagaries of the free market they want some kind of government command of the system and theyre willing to trade some rate increases for greater certainty if you had to boil it down they want greater control here somehow maslin said i think the governor and the legislature would be well served to listen to that right now in fact recent proposals by the governor and the legislature such as the states one zero billion purchase of longterm power or a state takeover of the utility transmission system show they are addressing such concerns political analysts say davis polling reflects a pervasive reliance by politicians at all levels of government on public opinion a focus that is not helpful when confronting a highly technical matter like energy policy indeed davis is not alone democratic assembly leaders recently used their own poll numbers to convince colleagues to spend four zero zero million in taxpayer money to buy electricity polls are crude instruments that pose simplistic questions to people who are often uneducated about the issues said professor barbara oconnor director of the institute for the study of politics and media at california state university sacramento i think its the absence of leadership when politicians base their behavior on what people think of them oconnor said the state gop might agree the party bucked the desires of republican legislative leaders and aired radio commercials last week criticizing davis leadership on the crisis the ads began running yesterday in the bay area at least one republican had asked the party to discontinue the ads so far maslin said californians are not blaming davis for the power problems because they see it as caused by deregulation legislation passed in one nine nine six when republican gov pete wilson was in office the way they view the current governor and the legislature is fix it he said were not blaming you because we understand it didnt happen on your watch but get us out of this mess as the states chief executive davis has been criticized by industry executives analysts lawmakers and regulators for his wariness in contrast the statement davis officials faxed last week to police and fire chiefs heads of school districts municipal officials and the like praised his bold decisive leadership davis spokesman steve maviglio described the fax as a tool for public education its just information its not political at all maviglio said this is part of a continuing effort the governors office has done to inform the community about the governors actions and policies it was first used during the education proposals last year outraged utility executives meanwhile said the governors fax wrongly blamed them for not being more proactive im appalled by reading such a statement said harold ray executive vice president of southern california edison co ray was particularly irked by a passage about longterm contracts between the states major utilities and power providers the governors fax claimed that since davis appointed loretta lynch president of the states public utilities commission last march two two the puc has approved every request from the utilities for authority to sign longterm contracts in a timely fashion ray claims that signing contracts directly with generators instead of through a staterun exchange could have saved his company about one billion on aug three the commission ostensibly gave the utilities authority to sign such contracts but edison and pacific gas and electric co executives say the regulators refused to approve contracts or to provide guidelines for them the commissions energy division is supervised by lynch she told the chronicle that the utilities should simply have acted without guidance from commission staff democratic assemblyman dennis cardoza chair of the rules committee said he believes that the puc has contributed to energy market dysfunction in recent years cardoza however praised davis for now aggressively pursuing new generating plants in california and said any spin control will likely be irrelevant in the end because results will be what matters i dont think any amount of damage control is going to fix things if we dont get control of this said cardoza if were able to solve the problem we get kudos if we dont we get dinged photo

katherine seligman chronicle staff writer zero one one eight two zero zero one the san francisco chronicle final aone one copyright two zero zero one yes the energy crisis is serious but most californians see it as a plot by power companies seeking to jack up utility bills according to the latest energy poll by the field institute the poll released today found californians growing more dubious about the roots of the socalled crisis more than half of those surveyed five seven percent said the shortage amounts to an attempt to raise rates rather than an emergency born purely from lack of generating sources or from increased demand real or fabricated the public is overwhelmingly concerned about the crisis and is staying tuned to news of blackouts and energy grids both the field poll and one from the public policy institute of california show almost everyone is following the news in fact the energy shortage has joined education as a top concern for californians according to the public policy institute poll also released today that poll reveals that almost seven five percent of californians say energy is a big problem and only about half of those polled think economic good times are ahead a drop from seven two percent in august and state residents are mad at just about everyone for the energy situation and the looming shortages the public is in a pretty foul mood said mark dicamillo of the field poll they blame just about everybody the public is pretty cynical about how we got to this situation when asked whos to blame for the situation about threequarters of those in the field poll pointed the finger at failure to build new power plants the states private utility companies and the state public utilities commission more than six zero percent blamed the federal energy regulatory commission the state legislature activist groups that blocked new plant construction and an increase in industrial energy use gov gray davis however came out on top of the electrical heap with only four three percent blaming him for the current situation fifty three percent blamed his predecessor pete wilson most respondents said they take at least somewhat seriously the potential for utility company bankruptcy and with it the threat of blackouts when it comes to solving the problem most want the state government to step in and become a middleman buying electricity for the utility companies the field poll found davis has argued that the state can get better prices because of its good credit rating the electricity would then be sold to the power companies in order to fix the problem most californians six one percent think the state should go back to regulating the energy industry only three zero percent of those in the field poll said they think the crisis can be solved without reregulation in the public policy institutes poll only three seven percent advocated reregulation with three two percent favoring the construction of more power plants and two zero percent leaning toward more conservation although they are deeply concerned about the energy shortage most californians responded in the field poll that they dont want air quality standards relaxed to produce more electricity only three two percent thought that solution was satisfactory but when asked if air quality standards should be relaxed in some areas to get older plants functioning and to speed approval of new plants californians were more divided almost half four seven percent approved of that strategy fortysix percent opposed it the energy problems dont bode well for the state according to those surveyed by the public policy institute eightytwo percent said they thought the issue will damage the states economy in the next few years with more than half saying it will hurt the economy a great deal californians are deeply worried about the implications of this crisis for the state economy and their own pocketbooks said the institutes survey director mark baldassare right now they are still holding out hope but their optimism as well as the political fortunes of state leaders may suffer if they fail to see some action soon the private nonpartisan research institute

state senator is calling on the governor to investigate what he called price gouging by a taxpayersupported agency in los angeles its one thing to have some texas guy ripping you off but its another thing to have a public agency in your own state said sen don perata i think they ought to give the money back the oakland democrat cited reports that put the los angeles department of water and powers profits from sales to the state during the past seven weeks at four zero zero million during a period when the states electricity bill has moved past two billion perata comparing the agencys electricity sales to its raids on northern counties water during los angeles formative years said a rebate is in order to prevent heightened conflicts between northern and southern california i think its perfectly legal perata said i think its immoral but frank salas chief of staff for the los angeles agency said his department is selling electricity at a reasonable one five percent profit he said recent sales to the state have been in the range of three zero zero to three five zero per megawatthour and that the four zero zero million profit figure cited by perata was grossly inflated we would welcome an investigation salas said if there is an investigation we would be shown to be a good neighbor to the state and not a price gouger perata said that if davis does not investigate the states purchases from the southern california agency he will file a formal request under the public records law to force disclosure regarding the purchases details about the state electricity purchases have been shrouded in secrecy because the governor says release of the information will allow power generators to manipulate prices and drive them higher this whole area is a like a star chamber perata said this stuff cant be proprietary if it involves public agencies meanwhile the head of the los angeles water and power agency who has been tapped by davis to lead the states efforts to obtain longterm electricity contracts said that even though the state is spending about five five million a day to keep the lights on state coffers can be refilled without raising consumer rates there is no basis for any rate increase maybe ever said s david freeman director of the los angeles water agency freeman was responding to an order issued wednesday by the state public utilities commission clearing the way for the state treasury to be reimbursed for its power purchases the puc meeting in san francisco delayed for at least a week a decision on the more controversial issue of how much the state should be repaid but it did issue an order that said the state department of water resources is entitled to reimbursement pacific gas electric co contends that under a formula set up by lawmakers the utility is entitled to collect its costs for buying power before reimbursing the state according to the utilitys calculations that would mean it would keep all of the money paid to it by customers even though the state today is buying up to onethird of the electricity used each day freeman countered that for every kilowatthour the state purchases its utilities are required to pass on the roughly six cents or seven cents that customers pay on their bills to buy those kilowatthours they are whistling dixie freeman said the law is very clear it is not their money puc president loretta lynch said she hoped the commission would decide the question next week freeman said he has deliberately kept his distance in transactions between the state and his employer and that he does not know how much electricity the department of water and power is selling to the state freeman has been working with davis for the period of time perata is examining on my watch there was no price

know it was not an application named under the it services agreement it seems to be still something of a work in progress but has some good functionality that it delivers today unfortunately it will require some rework to make it work after the sale closes the vba access application is currently stored locally on the client workstation or pc it uses odbc and the local nt id to connect to global and unify and pull in data to update its database it currently has no network login process and doesnt lend itself to a terminal server set up without some work since we have spent money on a contractor to develop the application im hesitant to just give it away and have you load it directly on an aep pc without some type of reimbursement for the development costs even then wed have to work through the process of updating the data this application would have to come through enrons firewalls to get updates and that would probably not be acceptable to security we could redesign the interfaces to be more of scheduled push from enron but wed want to be reimbursed for this cost even then youd have to rework the data feeds for the application after our service agreement terminates to get data from your applications from talking to mike i understand that up to three people once a month used to pull all of this data together manually in the past to make these filings how would

_________________________________________________________________________________________ the results of our survey confirmed for the management committee and me the great things you feel about enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move enron forward the following are some of the things were doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback now heres what were going to do based on your feedback stock price we are all concerned about our stock price which has declined significantly this year the primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include a decline in the overall market and economy certain enronspecific issues such as california india and recent management turnover a meltdown in the broadband sector which may have been as much as three zero four zero of our stock price at the high lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winters high and concerns over the pace of energy deregulation these concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution wholesale and retail businesses very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth and future earnings growth as has enron we fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve over the past month we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses we have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money we also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward mark koenig executive vice president of investor relations will host brown bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions he will also continue to host espeak sessions to answer employee questions greg whalley mark frevert and i will also hold discussions with various groups of employees which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide watch for these events the prc the relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives nevertheless we recognize that certain aspects of the prc may have caused some of you concern and we believe we can improve refine streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone therefore we will make the following changes to the prc process prior to yearend effective immediately relative performance discussions will occur annually at yearend however business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently the current preferred distribution will no longer be required across enron business units will be asked to identify only their top one zero and bottom one zero performers for review by enrons office of the chairman annually at yearend we will continue to use the pep three six zero degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees we will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year finally we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes in the november issue of enron business we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process in addition there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to yearend employee morale we believe the stock price our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale additionally some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns effective immediately we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their human resources hr rep we are establishing a new business function we are calling employee relations er that will report directly to the office of the chairman cindy olson will head this function more details of how this group and hr will operate will be communicated in the next few days over the long term we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles we will encourage vice presidents and above as well as other current and emerging leaders to complete executive impact influence training these sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people additionally we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via communicate which will be rolled out immediately communicate is an interactive training course that uses enron scenarios and a combination of video voice mails emails and meetings notes to analyze user performance based on a participants responses and actions external reputation we all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year the single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees we recognize that as enrons ambassadors in the marketplace the more you know about our strategy performance and challenges the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company to ensure you are better informed we will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting enron in addition to our existing communication efforts like email messages and internal publications ebiz and enron business we will post a qa on current issues on the enron intranet at homeenroncom httphomeenroncom this will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers as we said before greg mark and i as well as members of our management committee will meet with groups of employees across enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges look for these to start in midoctober integrity respect i believe as i said previously we need to reinforce our core values particularly integrity and respect from what you have told us in this survey you agree enrons values will have more importance in each employees evaluation and feedback we ask that all employees regardless of level hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis we are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers we will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional specific feedback on employee issues like ethics integrity and individual concerns if you would like to participate in these focus groups please send an email to cindy olson periodically i will host a special feature column in enron business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results finally i give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding enrons strategy and challenges and listening to your concerns and ideas but we would ask for your commitment too we need your dedication to enron and its values as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve longterm success we will conduct another employee survey early next year please continue to send me

john this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions one i was not involved in the lng ship project i shall read the dash and give you my comments without looking at the details i think that the decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island project please see point two two elba island i am working with doug rotenberbg brad hitch scott earnest sally becks organization and rac to set up the book for the elba island transaction the next step will be to expand the book to capture all the enrons lngrelated positions in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges a working group is meeting to close a few remaining gaps tomorrow tuesday at eight three zero a few comments on the book design and my view of the project a the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under longterm contracts or became available due to some shortterm frictions the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the longterm contract prices the economics of the deal as represented by the book we are setting up will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis arranging shipping and coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us in other words we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction b the transaction will cover the period of one seven years with an extension option of five years even if we can lockin the lng volumes over this time period we have no ability to lockin the other side of the spread us gas prices for such a long tenor this is essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng nat gas spread and i would not recommend lockingin only one leg of the spread one solution would be to cover lets say five zero of he lng volumes for the first five years and lockin the nat gas side on the us market side c the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of lng shipping rates schedules etc i would set up a big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market d my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island deal that are good for enron and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions longterm lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail that correlates very well with brent vince john sherriff zero five one four two zero zero zero zero one four zero am to vince j kaminskihouectect cc lauren urquhartlonectect subject lng may one nine decision vince i havent spoken

always full info on our trip along with pictures can be found on our web site httpskimountainzonecomtwo zero zero one yellowstonehtml win thorofare yellowstonezero one s heart of gold by win goodbody thorofare creek two ocean pass atlantic creek yellowstone point ope n creek to hunters from around the world these are more than just names of geographic features in northwest wyomingzero one s teton wilderness they are legendary places renowned for abundant wildlife in the most remote area of the uszero one s lower four eight states the closest road is three zero miles distant right next door is yellowstone national park for those who know some part of the thousands of square miles of rugged terrain here on either side of the park border the area is simply zero one thorofarezero one eight inside this one word fits th e very heart of yellowstone country the distilled essence of everything that is great about this crown jewel of americazero one s natural heritage thorofare really refers to two main drainages that grow from steep mountain creeks into larger rivers that meander through flat wide valley bottoms before merging each drainage is initially tight and dense spilling down between rocky absaroka peaks but then broadens and opens into vast meadows etched with old oxbows where waterways shift back and forth the thorofare creek drainage starts on the north face of younts peak near the continental divide and heads north before turning west the yellowstone river drainage starts on the south side of younts and goes west before turning north these two rivers wind around opposite sides of the massive thorofare platea u and then join just before entering yellowstone national parkzero one s southeast corner it seems odd that the river downstream of the confluence is called the yellowstone for before they meet thorofare creek looks larger than the yellowstone river from this point the yellowstone flows north into the park until it hits yellowstone lake some one five miles away thorofare hosts the bulk of its human visitors during one concentrated period each year every autumn in those parts of thorofare outside the park hunters arrive to pursue elk moose deer and other game whether o r not they are in harmony with the letter or more importantly the spirit of the law there are in fact many permanent hunting camps scattered throughou t thorofare and the teton wilderness and it is clear that hunting is big business miniature towns spring up as large groups with convoys of horses haul in everything needed to live well for weeks on end the more developed camps feature raised platforms log furniture corrals and enormous five zero gallon steel drums in which food is secured from bears though there are usually ample numbers of animals to hunt outside the park guides and outfitters will place salt licks just beyond the park boundary in an effort to lure creatures out and ensure that paying clients have something to blast away at other people far fewer in number come to hunt with camera and binoculars either in summer or fall for them just being in thorofare and feeling th e pulse of this magnificent land is sufficient payback for the long journey in here are also to be found animals that cannot be hunted such as wolve s and grizzly bears despite all of the usual problems that will have an impact on thorofarezero one s future this is still a staggering swath of relati vely undisturbed earth where to paraphrase the wilderness act of one nine six four zero one zero one man is a visitor who does not remainzero one eight all told several thousand people might pass through during the annual window of milder weather but for more than half the year from early november until early june no one comes with the first real snowfall the back country falls quiet and the last humans decamp for town a visit to thorofare in winter is therefore a chance to experience real isolation and behold yellowstonezero one s unique beauty during a harsh season this was the fourth leg of our yellowstone traverse and a return to longer distance travel the second and third legs of the winter had each been hal f as long as the one before the first leg was one three zero miles the second was six zero the third was three five we had to break out of this pattern i realized or we would soon be down to day trips of several hundred yards a trip into thorofare was just the thing to turn our attentions back to bigger miles an d more challenging territory we figured it would take two weeks to cover th e eight zero mile route we had plotted remote in summer thorofare is even harder to reach when snow is on the ground approaching from the south itzero one s three zero miles through wild absaroka territory continuing from where we left off at the end of our last leg through the northern gros ventre range we depart from togwotee pass in unsettled weather scattered snow showers swirl around in a black sky after several sunny days in town which i used mainly to sit inside and eat too much it looks like we are at last due for some snow amazingly togwotee pass is the first road running east west across the continental divide in wyoming we have come to since starting our trip almos t two months ago two zero zero miles to the south we will cross only one or two more roads between here and the northern turnaround point of our traverse at bozeman montana heading north from togwotee feels a little bit bleak even if we do have a groomed road to follow for the first few miles wezero one re really leaving civilization behind and going deep into the woods this time or so we think five miles on a stunning old wooden lodge appears built in one nine two two it stands on the original highway to yellowstone and was the stopping point for many illustrious personalities back in the day in more recent years i had heard from someone it was a basic back country lodge where you could stay or eat just a nice place to stop in we ski hungril y to its door drawn by fullblown fantasies of one more night inside one last meal before being forced back into our pathetic floorless tent itzero one s all wezero one ve brought this time where we live on dehydrated beans and stick s of butter sadly brooks lake lodge has turned into an upscale if barely patronized outfit of late a way station for private snowmobile tours the local henchman materializes instantly and removes us from the bar before we can even inquire whatzero one s on tap or find out if any of the paying guests want to put some money on a game of billiards i ask whether by any chance therezero one s some unheated back hallway in employee housing where we could ma ybe curl up in our sleeping bags for the night the response is as warm as a mid february night in yellowstone no can do we decide to retreat just beyond the fascist compoundzero one s perimeter to erect our shantytown for the night itzero one s now snowing in earnest itzero one s hard to explain the kind of magnetic appeal these last outposts of humanity exert on me as we leave on a trip it seems to be getting worse a s the winter wears on each leg is just a little harder to embark on each departure day especially if the weather is dark seems a little grimmer i feel i am looking for a reason any reason to put off for one more day the inevitable wilderness death march that is sure to come any diversion at all to hang us up to be rebuffed at the lodge when comfort is so close seems unbearable izero one m just not ready to crawl into the sleeping bag aga in i almost want to shell out the one five zero for a night indoors and itzero one s not just major obvious pitstops like a lodge in front of my sk is that make me want to postpone the inevitable outward bound on our drives from town to trailheads now every little gas station we pass suddenly look s like a great place to stop and explore they might have precious local gifts we can find nowhere else they might sell those orange hats that say zero one my wife thinks izero one m huntingzero one eight i need one of those or maybe a pi ece of petrified wood with zero one wyomingzero one eight emblazoned on it definitely need one of those in the pack and i must get another road atlas for my collection any kind of establishment that has anything for sale must be investigated look over there donzero one t we need a three zero zero pound chainsaw wood carving of a m oose head what to take with us can we stop at this bathroom we just stopped one five minutes ago i know but i donzero one t want to miss one should w e stop for lunch here we already had lunch twice i know butzero one we may n ever eat again whoa there a point of historical interest can we stop and read about how trapper bucky nearly starved to death at this very spot one five zero years ago and had to resort to eating the leather from his snowshoes we really shouldnzero one t hits too close to home plus itzero one s getting late thatzero one s exactly the point i think if i can just stall for another hour or two we may have to wait another day before casting off like sand slipping throug h my fingers the few remaining opportunities for frittering away time vanish into the air the trailhead is getting dangerously close now doesnzero one t look like therezero one s any way out wait turn this car around i canzero one t leave without knowing who won the match between the jersey penguins and the hosers i try to disguise my inadequate knowledge of pro sports by keeping the references vague leave off a city name here the full team moniker there izero one m sure as heck not going to risk mentioning a specific sport by name cast the net wide i think better chance of getting something could be baseball basketball hockey australian football or cricket izero one m talking about jersey might mean new jersey or maybe izero one m off in britain following a darts tournamen t have to keep joe guessing there must be a pro sport game going on somewhere in the world at this moment and i have to know the outcome izero one m hoping cricket donzero one t those things go on for days we canzero one t leave now not when sri lanka might be trailing norway by hundreds of points or baskets or yards or whatever they have in that game come on sri lanka no dice a last whimpering claim that izero one ve forgotten my stock car racing magazines and canzero one t go forwar d without them does nothing to slow the car down the trailhead looms izero one m being delivered to my doom with no delay the morning after being denied our civil rights at the brooks lake lodge w e awake to more snow not what i was hoping to see itzero one s coming down n ot really dumping but steadily snowing we may have a few inches from the night this is the first real accumulation from a storm wezero one ve seen this winter and it has an immediate effect on our mood before izero one m more tha n three words into the sentence izero one ve crafted to subliminally convince joe that maybe we should stay put and see what the weather does he practically shouts his assent to the plan apparently wezero one re on the same wavelength itzero one s the first rest day wezero one ve taken on the trail the first day we ha venzero one t packed up and kept moving no matter what the very thought of sitting around drinking endless cups of tea and reading sounds like heaven to me and then there is the lodge with roaring fireplaces and gourmet food just across the way we vow to take a second shot at infiltrating the posh resort it turns out the lodge is open to the public read unwashed masses for lunch so we slink over and decide to pay way too much for a fabulous four course meal the fact that we are now actual customers parting with dollar s and not marauding visigoths for the moment keeps the welcoming committee from last night at bay i still feel like there is a closed circuit camera pointing at our table an d burly guards in an underground command center watching our every move but for the moment everything is ok here it is day two and joezero one s having the mushroom fettuccine while i demolish the linguine with cream sauce our only concern is the size of the portions but we figure this isnzero one t the u sual zero one all you can eatzero one eight joint wezero one re accustomed to and that a request for zero one some morezero one eight wouldnzero one t be well received now that wezero one ve taken the financial hit we decide to get our moneyzero one s worth we have justified the significant outlay for lunch as tickets to a day indoors the snow continues to fall even though the restaurant closes at two three zero pm we hang around and play pool in the bar then we settle in with some magazines and try to strike up a conversation with the bartender maybe we can find some common ground that will lead to an invitation to sta y inside tonight doesnzero one t happen i watch him periodically out of the co rner of my eye to see if hezero one s whispering into some tiny microphone on his lap el reporting back to the command center on our whereabouts come five pm joe is still inside by the fire reading and smiling at every staff member who passes by they seem to be appearing with some frequency maybe to check whether hezero one s still there hezero one s doing his best to look like a legitimate overnight patron but theyzero one re not buying it theyzero one re prob ably trying to decide which of several different lodge security forces should be tasked with removing him meanwhile izero one ve reached my shame threshold and have gone outside for a sk i around the lake not wanting to be present for the inevitable handson eviction that will occur as soon as our goon friend from last night returns sure enough around six pm joe is formally asked to leave he goes without a fight and heads back to the tent to inform me of the defeat as much as we might want to itzero one s pretty clear by now that we are not go ing to be spending the rest of the winter at brooks lake lodge i donzero one t eve n think we can get away with our seven hour lunch scam again izero one m picturing a n all out offensive by the authorities to remove us from the immediate area and maybe wyoming starting first thing in the morning if they so much as catch a glimpse of us we have to move our choices are to turn around and ski the five miles back to the road wher e wezero one ll start hitch hiking south to mexico and a sunny beach or to push o n we decide on the latter and saddle up on the morning of day three wezero one re absaroka bound not a peep from the lodge as we head across brooks lake i look around half expecting to see artillery pieces on surrounding peaks swiveling towards us trained and ready just in case we change our minds an d try to head inside again but the layover was not a total loss far from it in fact the poor weather motivated us to consult our maps for the first time and see exactly what we were getting into it was a bit of a wake up call we seem to be in the habit of planning most sections of our trip on very large scale maps restaurant place mats of wyoming road atlases maps of the us hanging in drug stores globes of the earth all of these have at one point or another two zero been the research tool of choice for plotting our way through greater yellowstone the only problem with these topographic specimens is that they yield none o f the lowlevel detail necessary to actually navigate day by day what ends up happening is that the night before we leave on a leg assuming we have had the foresight to get our hands on a quad or other smaller scale map we sit down to examine how we might actually get through wherever it is we are heading suddenly the landscape is full of cliffs avalanche slopes gorges and dense woods itzero one s sort of like tracing a finger across a map of arizona thinking it m ight be a fun hike then realizing you just crossed the grand canyon what looked pretty straightforward on the map of wyoming that flashed across the tv screen during an evening weather report now looks downright impossible these are usually quiet moments as we each pore over the maps and realize that there is no way we can go where we thought we could spreading out all our quad maps on the table in the lodge after lunch i glance nervously at the bartender to see if this breach of decorum might prompt a call to the command center we get a rude shock there is no way we are going to be able to follow the continental divide north from brooks lake to the headwaters of thorofare creek as was our plan the divide here is a featureless plateau above treeline and getting on and off would require crossing steep slopes with this yearzero one s poor snow conditions n ot to mention the storm that was currently unloading it would be plain foolis h to head up there plus we donzero one t have a real tent and our experience on island in the sky during leg two has already filled my annual quota for traveling not to mention camping on exposed plateaus in high winds during whiteouts itzero one s as if there is a blackboard in front of us with our route chalked o n it we get out the eraser and wipe the slate clean we have to rethink th e entire thing or at least the first half we notice there is a low route option it winds around and follows drainages where the continental divide route is straight but there are no dangerous slopes and it stays mostly on valley bottoms we hadnt thought of going this way before because of dreadfully dense wood s and the potential for out of body bushwhacking experiences but now we see there are trails we could follow it might not be too bad yeah izero one ve heard that one before without much discussion we mentally draw the new route up on the board wezero one re happy about it it feels like a huge reli ef now to know that we arenzero one t going off to be sacrificed to the weather god s the optimism about our new route more than offsets any bad feelings from th e brooks lake lodge affair and we set off excited and energetic i am rarin g to go and donzero one t want to return to town anymore for two days we hack our way toward the south buffalo fork drainage the going isnzero one t great we see some of the same bottomless collapsible junk wezero one ve come to expect and love but we are moving forward at least by afternoon of day four we arrive at a hunting camp on the side of a large meado w below pendergraft peak in a low snow year such as this it is very easy to spot these camps some more elaborate than others the site of crude log structures and a large metal drum inspires us to make ourselves a home away from home we dig a large rectangular pit down to the ground and gather wood for a fire in an hour we are as comfortable as one could be in or out of town there are some large trees above us and even though snow is falling we are sheltered we stoke the fire gaze out into the absaroka night and enjoy a break from the brutal cold that has followed us on past legs one of my favorite rationalizations is that it canzero one t be brutally cold if itzero one s storming and vice versa so the good news tonight is that it isnzero one t brutally cold because itzero one s storming the next morning after more consulting with the maps we make the second major change in our route as snow continues to fall and we look at the area around younts peak on the quad for the first time of course we notice what a perfect avalanche slope our route crosses no way to avoid it this is where we planned to get over the continental divide which run s along the spine of the high absaroka crest in this area worse we notice that the trail on the other side of the divide up thorofare creek stops before the head of the canyon there are several miles between where we would pass younts peak and pick up the trail on the valley floor below hmmm i wonder why that is if there is anything i have learned so far this year it is to stay on the trail i have told joe i will pay him five zero for every time i suggest leaving the trail as long as he hits me with a shovel and prevents me from actually doing it if there is a trail through an area there is a reason for it and if a trail stops somewhere you can be darn sure there is a reason for it after all people have been traveling through these parts for hundreds even thousands of years itzero one s highly unlikely that all the nice routes through havenzero one t been found already adventurous off trail exploration i n a place like the absarokas certainly has its place but not when youzero one re tr ying to make good time with heavy packs in february examining the tight spacing of contour lines on our quad map i see that th e upper thorofare drainage near younts peak looks like prime habitat for some of my least favorite species namely cliffs and gorges i also suspect there are healthy local populations of downed trees and impenetrable brush lurking in there our experiences leaving the trail along the green river during leg one and then again coming down redmond creek during leg two have lef t too much emotional scar tissue to ignore i donzero one t want to do it again i picture us rappelling with packs using the shoelace our one two zero foot section o f eight mm chord no thanks afraid that a descent of the upper thorofare would use up our lifetime quotas of world class bushwhacking and canyoneering we decide to nix it but we then see there is another way over the divide with a trail the whole way instead of going north from younts and then west following thorofare creek toward the massive meadows where thorofare creek and the yellowstone river meet we can go west and then north following the yellowstone river izero one m disappointed we are abandoning thorofare creek but the idea of descending the yellowstone river almost from its source which as for thorofare creek is younts peak is thrilling a few minutes spent with th e map and we are once again excited and happy with this change of plans there is no question itzero one s an easier route also a little bit shorter all these breakthroughs in planning and navigation and itzero one s not even nine am meanwhile as we realize the route just got easier and shorter and notice snow is still falling on and off and feel the warmth from the morning fire we have going at possibly the best camp site either one of has ever enjoyed in winter what do we decide to do butzero one take another day off and stay put wezero one re getting used to this rest day thing now itzero one s so easy to do you simply wake up and announce youzero one re not going anywhere and then go back t o sleep again i am the first to verbalize the concept unsure whether joe is going to think i have gone completely soft the second rest day and it zero one s only day five instead he responds as if izero one ve just offered to carry his p ack the rest of the trip a rest day it will be then back to the fire once again we are both thinking the same thing we spend the day lounging reading and collecting enough wood for a massiv e bonfire before this winter i had only experienced one fire on an overnight ski trip and that was in june as i had never done it much before i never thought of making fire a part of the daily winter camping routine if you had asked me about having a fire in winter before this year i probably would have said it was a lot of trouble and not worth the effort but that was before i went ski touring with joe hartney a veteran of not one but several courses on tracking and outdoor skills taught by my fellow new jerseyan tom brown joe knows what hezero one s doing ou t here thank god one of us does i increasingly feel like i am playing client to joezero one s guide when it comes to fire joe leaps into action lik e a dynamo he can have a blaze going in no time and seems to instinctively se t about gathering wood the moment we make camp much as i grab the shovel and start excavating a hole for our tent after seeing how easy it is to get one going in the right conditions i am now a winter fire convert a fire in winter is nice anytime anywhere but in the absarokas right now conditions are so firefriendly that it is almost foolish not to have one like much of the west the absarokas are still bone dry after the active fire year in two zero zero zero all the fuel that did not burn is still right there under a few feet of snow actually the absarokas themselves did not ignite much this past year but they could have literally all you need to do to start a fire is brush the snow off a piece of wood and hold a match to it itzero one s astonishing how dry it is you can hold a match to boughs on a dea d tree and ignite the entire canopy past blazes killed many trees but left them standing they now fall down all over the place there are huge quantities of partially burned trees on the ground it takes little effort to find and collect them possibly the best thing about winter fires is that you can have them in places you never could in the summer whereas in current conditions a summer bonfire in south buffalo fork would set wyoming on fire in winter itzero one s perfectly safe and manageable we leave our hunting camp on day six and even though we have spent almost tw o days there doing nothing but eating and roasting next to the fire itzero one s n ot easy to pack up the weather remains spotty and we know wezero one re long over due for a pummeling but everything we own is dry and we are fully rested and beyond well fed building on the obscene amount of food i consumed during the last stint in town i have continued to eat like itzero one s the end of the world and now feel a little sick i almost have to force myself to eat dinner just to keep the weight reduction program for my pack going but in truth izero one m no longer hungry i guess there are worse afflictions i could be suffering from in the back country having gone as far as possible up the south buffalo fork wezero one re ascendin g lake creek toward the continental divide now we have to go up and over to hit the yellowstone river and we pray for a decent weather window to see u s through wezero one ve made all the route changes we can at this point there zero one s no way to avoid this high crossing the first day going up is pretty good there are so many trail blazes on s o many trees we may as well have a set of runway lights guiding us along we donzero one t even have to pay attention to follow the trail we get some sun splashes but no real views that paint a picture of the route ahead canzero one t really see where wezero one re going up above that night it clears up which brings back the cold down to around zero one two zero f but wezero one re doing fine the next day we get going early and things look good initially we approac h within a mile or two of ferry lake almost to the divide all the snow thatzero one s been falling over the last few days is really adding up now we zero one re glad we donzero one t have to face that blank younts headwall in what are surely terrible avalanche conditions itzero one s deep powder would be great skiing but wezero one re breaking trail through it a few hundred feet above ferry lake is a mild pass over the divide that wil l deliver us into woodard canyon at the bottom of which we will hit the yellowstone river our highway for the rest of the trip once we reach the yellowstone all routefinding and weather issues will be done as itzero one s fl at ground on the trail the rest of the way even if itzero one s a raging storm we will be in the trees and can slog along ok i am looking forward to that moment even though i know we are sure to hit some terrible snow down there izero one d rather face the bad snow demon than be way up here waiting for the blizzard of zero one zero one to kick in but it will have to be another day that we find out what woodard canyon looks like quickly thoroughly the weather turns evil itzero one s snowing and blowing and visibility deteriorates we canzero one t actually see ferry lake but we know it must be there in front of us we leave the trees to start plodding up toward the lake and get a taste of the wind itzero one s not an is land in the sky gale but still humming along all the same we canzero one t see a thing we blunder around for an hour and incredibly are still not sure where the lake is this is a decentsized alpine lake and the fact that w e canzero one t find it doesnzero one t bode well for tracking down the pass above we take cover in a clump of windblasted trees to figure out a plan i know joe wants to go up and over regardless izero one m not that concerned a bout finding the pass we can get out the compass and start flying blind if it comes to that itzero one s more the question of what descending woodard canyon in the maelstrom will be like that has me worried whereas we can put it in reverse retrace our steps and still find our way back to treeline and a feasible camp site on this side of the divide once we go through the pass wezero one re just on our own in the whiteout with no knowledge of what lies ahe ad the voice of fear and paranoia prevails and i convince joe that retreat sounds pretty good right about now we turn tail and though itzero one s not b een more than two five minutes or so since we entered the stand of trees our tracks have been erased by the wind we just took it as a given that our tracks would be there as an umbilical chord for at least a few hours or so in case we wanted to go back but theyzero one re gone we eventually find them by prob ing around for a more supportable strip of snow through the white and manage to feel our way along we make it back into the woods by mid afternoon and set up the tent behind a massive tree that shields us from the wind almost completely time to wait the storm rages on itzero one s saturday and i realize a good friend is hav ing a noholdsbarred three zero th birthday bash back in portland or this very night the theme is saturday night fever what i wouldnzero one t give to be there instead izero one m stuck here singing songs from the soundtrack the names of several of them such as zero one night feverzero one eight and zero one staying alivezero one eight seem rather appropriate given our situation from joezero one s scowl i can tell izero one m not the only one wishing i were elsewhere we get our window the next day it isnzero one t clear but we can see the lake two zero and once we reach it we can see the pass and then it does clear or at least on the east side of the divide what we see confirms a halfbaked weather theory we have been working on the last few days coming up the south buffalo fork we have had some real snow but we have also had nearly continuous light flurries as something frozen zero one not snow zero one falls from the air itzero one s more like tiny pieces of frozen vapor this happens all the time even when skies are clear itzero one s almost like any moisture that is in the air zero one even if there are no clouds zero one is being squeezed out given the local topography this makes sense the continental divide here is a high mountain crest above one zero zero zero zero feet and all weather moving west to east gets pushed up over this massive obstacle with the lifting the moisture has no choice but to come out once we are at the pass and can se e both sides of the divide we are given a stark piece of visual evidence that seems to support the theory to the west the south buffalo fork is a sea o f clouds while to the east down woodard canyon itzero one s a clear sunny day descending woodard canyon is a joy the upper reaches of the drainage are so open we can just cruise along effortlessly i have taken up the call i championed toward the end of leg one in the wind river range that itzero one s al l downhill from here while technically true itzero one s also almost four five miles to the road joe strips his climbing skins off his skis and makes a few turns in perfect powder as we get into the woods we find more of the manic trai l blazes everywhere we lose the trail maybe once or twice while crossing open avalanche chutes but quickly rediscover it i have started to photograph these trail blazes i want a collection of them what could be more welcome to the eye of a ski tourer in the absarokas than big fresh trail blazes we are really getting lucky with this one before we know i t the downhill stops and we are standing on the bank of the upper yellowstone river it seems hard to believe but we have penetrated to the inner sanctum how did this happen the moat has been crossed the turret guards sacked door s broken down inner courtyards laid waste maidens rescued from towers we are there we have battled our way through to the most remote place in the lower four eight states and it wasnzero one t even that hard we listen as our shouts of joy echo crazily up into the canyons i cringe to think how enraged the local weather gods will be when they wake up and see that we are already over the divide and deep into the promised land nothing they can do about it now too late to throw the blizzard of zero one zero one at us sorry guys mayb e next time i almost want to cry it feels indescribable to be here at last the yellowstone river in february three five miles upstream from yellowstone lake i t seems so wild so quiet so alive so free and so far away itzero one s a vis ion that could sustain decades of wilderness ski touring just the thought tha t one day i might stand right here could get me through anything steepsided cliffs and slopes of burned thin trees plummet down on all sides it feels massive an ocean of wilderness there are animal tracks everywhere the river itself is not very wide yet after all we are only a few miles downstream from its origin on younts peak and itzero one s just gett ing going but there is no mistaking that with a little care and feeding and a few hundred miles of flow this little whipper snapper is going to grow int o one of the great rivers of the northern rockies we stand and gawk the weather is lovely and late afternoon color starts to paint the scene this is one to remember eventually we snap out of our stupor somewhat sobered by the realization that even if we have made it this far we still have a long way to go we continue along the trail more blazes for another hour before making camp we can just about see the opening ahead where the river veers north into a broad meadow wezero one ll surely reach it tomorrow joe builds a small fire from burned downfall and we settle in for a cold clear night day nine dawns perfectly clear and still a savage cold hangs in the air th e weather gods know that their snow machine is now more or less useless as we are out of the mountains and can keep going in just about any storm conditions but maybe they can slow us down or at least make life just a bit uncomfortable with their cold machine either they got a brand new turbocharged model for christmas or some ace mechanic has given the old on e a complete overhaul the results are impressive itzero one s in the zero one two five f range which wezero one ve seen before but this just feels really really cold joe and i leave the sleeping bags and immediately start doing the cold weather war dance this consists of jumping hopping running in place swinging arms and legs blowing on fingers zero one anything to keep the blood flowing the dance is an awkward enterprise to begin with and the fact that the snow is completely unsupportable at our camp site doesnzero one t make things any easier you canzero one t just roam around anywhere as one step on any snow we havenzero one t painstakingly packed down will result in a thigh deep plunge not what we need right now wezero one ve each sculpted our own little platforms and stand watching each other flop and twist talking at this point is strictly forbidden aside from the occasional obscenity or prehistoric grunt tra l a la ah yellowstone even as we plow into the normal morning routine of making breakfast and breaking camp the dance must continue this makes for a haphazard on agai n off again kind of progress that would probably be humorous to watch if we werenzero one t living it everything happens in fits and starts you canzero one t get out your stove light it and start melting some snow in one continuous process by that time your hands would be frozen solid you have to do on e little thing then rewarm do the next little thing then rewarm as it so happens the cooking area we hastily set up the night before is wedged against the fire pit therezero one s not much room for dancing in there but dancing is mandatory so i frantically pioneer a new traveling variatio n going back and forth between the cooking area and my platform i go and se t up the stove hands are now numb so i head back to the dance platform careful to only step on the few packed footprints that will support my weight on the way swing hop jump blow shake now therezero one s some fee ling so itzero one s back to light the stove into the fire pit i fill the stovezero one s primer cup with fuel wherezero one s the lighter i start searching zipped compartments in my jacket damn zippers canzero one t really operate them with gloves on not in that one hands are heading south fast therezero one s the lighter itzero one s in a ziploc bag str uggle to open it attention hands will be frozen hard as wood in one zero seconds izero one m getting an alert from the engine room that i should head back to the dance platform but i just want to get the damn lighter out at least on thi s run ziploc wonzero one t open begin countdown one zero nine eight zero one got the light er out may as well try to start the stove while izero one m here zero one seven six five zero one i flick it nothing shake it zero one four three two zero one i take off my glove to work th e lighter with my bare hand boy is it cold it wonzero one t light though it n ow feels like my hand is on fire too late zero one one abort abort i cram my useless limb back in the glove and hobble over toward the dance floor in my haste to get there i miss one of the packed footsteps itzero one s as if i stepped into space i plunge in to my thigh and as i wasnzero one t expecting this at all and am caught completely off guard i fall face first into the snow getting up isnzero one t easy because again therezero one s nothing to push solidly on to right myself except the packed spots which have now bee n obscured by my floundering itzero one s a full snow bath as i thrash around in the white stuff joe seems to be enjoying this at last i get up i pull my submerged leg out of the posthole but my camp bootie catches and remains lodged three feet down my socked foot comes ou t on its own and is instantly ice cold i balance on my one foot that has a bootie not wanting to have to step into the snow with my sock but pretty sure thatzero one s going to happen somehow i get the wayward bootie back and put it on on to the dance floor at last for some super charged disco movements time to get funky and so the morning goes the sun hits camp at about eight three zero am and the temperature leaps we realize part of the trouble is that wezero one ve camped in a classic cold air sink right next to the river bottom itzero one s taken longer than usual this morning to activate the four zero or five zero degree temperature swing wezero one ve come to expect itzero one s going to get up to two five f today as we war m up we wonder what all the fuss was about this is the day we make it out into the open after several hours on the trail we reach the burned fringes of the first of several large meadows along the upper yellowstone the snow has been mixed alternating between supportable and rotten junk through the burn itzero one s not too bad wezero one re actually covering ground late in the afternoon when we try to head straight across the first open swath of flood plain we find out what bad snow is all about itzero one s thigh deep junk each step goes right to the ground we have to l ean back on our skis to keep tips up lest they snag in the ample bushes wezero one re snowshoeing postholing on skis the pace is excruciatingly slow looking behind us it appears we have shoveled a three foot deep trough through the meadow wezero one re submarining along still about two zero miles from yellowstone lake and from the lake itzero one s another one five miles to the road and have five days of food left at the speed we are going now we could easily run out of food before we make it out our spirits previously sky high turn morbidly dark reaching the north side of the meadow we decide to call it a day and resor t to our favorite antidepressant to lighten things up fire joe starts hauling in entire trees i begin excavating an enormous rectangular area for the fire and our camp the snow is three feet deep but i outline a one two foot by two zero foot area and start digging an hour and a half later we have ourselves an amazing pit beside a beautiful meadow it is quite possibly the greatest camp site ever and the sun is still up our moods swing one eight zero degrees again and we enjoy a long night of stoking the fire and eating itzero one s such a beautiful night we decide to just sleep out under the stars in our giant pit itzero one s going to be another cold one i wake up at three three zero am my feet are going numb i wish i had left a stove se t up next to me so that i could cook a hot water bottle to put in my sleeping bag but i forgot izero one m conscious of a fiendishly powerful force that see ks to strip any warmth i have accumulated in my bag itzero one s horrendous muc h too cold to even get up and try to put on more clothes or get warmer i huddle and fiercely rub my feet together for the rest of the night i don zero one t fall back asleep this is all part of being admitted to the inner sanctum i say to myself the good news is that it isnzero one t storming because it zero one s brutally cold joe probably interprets my getting up at seven am to build a fire as a weird sign something must be up hezero one s done about all the fire building so f ar i just gather wood but here i am out of the bag breaking sticks and stacking them in a pyramid i have waited as long as i can and itzero one s no w light out i need to get warm and i know this is no ordinary morning not a cloud in the sky and dead calm but itzero one s colder than usual i can fe el it before i even consult my little key chain thermometer i am fully prepared to swear that this is the coldest temperature i have ever experienced i just know it is when i check the thermometer itzero one s doing something izero one ve never seen bef ore whereas we are used to seeing it maxed out at zero one two five f or so there is alwa ys a little bit of the red column protruding up from the ball at the bottom just a tiny bit but enough to see that there is a slight rise above the ball i always assumed that this was the max that no matter how cold it got the thermometer would always look the same i actually wished i had a better thermometer that wen lower just so we would know exactly how cold it really was but this morning there is no red column above the ball i look closely because itzero one s such a slight difference i could be wrong but there is no mistaking it only the ball is red nothing above it in my dementia i imagine that even some of the ball is empty yikes i estimate by some mystical and completely unscientific method that it is at least zero one three five f we later find out after exiting that on this morning it is zero one three zero f at west th umb on yellowstone lake we are slightly higher than the lake but more importantly we are in a massive cold air sink with steep walls on all sides it could well be even colder than zero one three five f where we are joe gets up and samples the brisk morning air itzero one s too cold for the wa r dance we have to get a fire going pronto we opt for a zero one hot startzero one eight and splash stove fuel on the wood to speed things up even white gas is a little ornery at this temperature and requires an open flame applied for several seconds to get a response but once coaxed over the initial hump it goes like crazy in no time we spend the next two hours sitting very close to a raging fire when the sun comes up it feels like a blow torch we spread our sleeping bags out to thaw and steam boils off of them it zero one s the first real drying sun wezero one ve had this winter despite the inhuman co ld i know that spring is on the way for the next four days we continue down the yellowstone river heading for yellowstone lake just beyond our camp with the swimming poolsized fire pit the snow mysteriously turns supportable and we begin to fly each day our packs are lighter the cold relents and itzero one s so hot during the afternoons that joe takes off his shirt animals are everywhere wezero one re just another two beasts roaming the valley floor which is now several mile s across we might even smell worse than most of the other ones around on these final days we hit our stride this is what we came for itzero one s abo ut the most enjoyable time one could have on a wilderness ski trip i donzero one t want it to end for the moment yellowstone is ours mighty thorofare creek comes in from the east wezero one ll have to come back another time to explore that universe we hit the southern boundary of yellowstone national park not far now we see wolf tracks theyzero one ve j ust been here ahead of us we spend a day skiing past the trident a peak izero one ve wanted to see for years wezero one re in the home stretch almost to the lake two zero colter peak goes by we can see the lake we arrive at the blank expanse of snow and ice welcomed by two bison who look like theyzero one ve been postho ling as much as we have this year the southeast arm of yellowstone lake day one three itzero one s the last day to the road we have something like one seven miles to ski to get to lake butte near the northeast end of yellowstone lake that zero one s where the groomed road from the east entrance comes in i know wezero one ll be able to find a ride there around to the south entrance and from there we zero one ll hitch another ride back to jackson our home base we take off like norwegian nordic racers on the most supportable snow wezero one ve seen we can even kick and glide and are really going for it the weather is sitting on the fence at first looks like maybe the snow machine is sputtering into life but then it dies must be out for maintenance as we watch yellowstone lake appears out of the clouds and we can see everything all the way across we see the promontory frank island dot island even west thumb this is my park we have talked about maybe trying to ski right across to west thumb but are wary of open water we stick to the eastern shore and rip past one point after another by early afternoon the day has turned into a keeper itzero one s sunny with ha rdly any wind and we are loose on yellowstone lake like a bunch of criminals just having the time of our lives we stop briefly when trading leads otherwise itzero one s heads down hammering but this is not a death march th is is pure joy we feel invincible and want to see what we can do after a winter of going slow we want to push it home the smell of the barn is overwhelming now we can taste the finish line and itzero one s only three pm sometime after rounding park point i glimpse steamboat point in the far distance i recognize it and know where the road comes in it can only be a few miles now after passing elk point i start to go flat out the movement feels good i donzero one t know how long i can keep it up but izero one l l stick with it for now joe sees that itzero one s still about four miles to go and ha s the sense to maintain a normal pace i canzero one t even feel my pack either izero one ve done permanent spinal damage and have lost all feeling in my shoulders or izero one ve learned how to pack light at last kick and glide i canzero one t believe izero one ve been missing this all th ose years i spent skiing on fixed heel gear the snow hisses by home stretch now one more small bay to cross and thatzero one s it i can see the road cut ahead i feel like i could get airborne with a little more effort a thundering final burst sees me to the line thatzero one s it izero one m there i slide to a stop all the cold all the bad snow itzero one s all been wiped away by the last four days i want to start shoutin g we made it yellowstone my yellowstone thorofare i canzero one t even thin k and luckily there is no need to joe comes in and we stand there resting then itzero one s time to go ashore just in time for a glorious sunset across the lake luck is with us and we get a ride out first thing in the morning as we had hoped driving back to jackson my thoughts race over the great landscape we have passed through there are so many more trips to do so much more t o learn but for a first time visit to thorofare wezero one ve done pretty well not only did we get to the place itself we got to the very heart of its spirit

months unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light we two zero want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis two zero please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation two zero and our position on california energy issues what happened in california the source of californiazero one s current problem is as straightforward as supp lytwo zero and demand californiazero one s economy grew two nine percent since one nine nine eight this incr easedtwo zero the demand for electricity by two four percent at the same time regulatorytwo zero restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state so two zero demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added the resul ttwo zero predictably is a shortage this summer peak capacity will be about one zero two zero percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state in addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related two zero factors that led to the current crisis first the statezero one s regulations two zero forced all sales and purchases into the spot market the spot market for two zero power is extraordinarily volatile the way firms behave in a free market two zero when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ngtwo zero term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility i ntwo zero california state regulation prevented this strategy this would be thetwo zero equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th etwo zero most volatile interest rate environment imaginable everything was finetwo zero while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat ttwo zero was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price second retail markets were not deregulated regulated retail rates remain edtwo zero in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keeptwo zero competition out this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa letwo zero prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at thetwo zero regulated retail rate they are now nearly bankrupt in short californiazero one s problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion two zero regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new two zero generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile two zero spot prices at the time california was developing its restructuring plan enron warned two zero the statezero one s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hichtwo zero if adopted would have averted the current crisis enronzero one s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ixtwo zero the problem power sellers including enron have been vilified by thetwo zero politicians and the media here are the facts other than a small amount of wind power enron is not a generator in the two zero state of california every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the two zero same market available to other california purchasers because we are atwo zero market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices we ar etwo zero interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc tstwo zero for our customers as a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from two zero the problems the stateszero one utilities and their customers now face we two zero protected and still protect our customers from price volatility you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supplytwo zero power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on two zero the open market early reports mischaracterized this as a zero one turnbackzero one eight of ourtwo zero customers to the utilities here are the facts as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current californiatwo zero market it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers direct lytwo zero from the utilities this decision reduced eeszero one s market price risk bytwo zero allowing ees to access lower utility rates ees did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue totwo zero receive the financial benefits of their contract prices ees is continuing to work with its california customers to

and shore up the financial stability of the statezero one s utilities increasing supply californiazero one s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing two zero short of byzantine enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les stwo zero than a year in california it often takes five to seven years california simpl ytwo zero must streamline this process ironically while many of the regulationstwo zero generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the two zero regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online andtwo zero displacing current plants which emit four zero times as much nox california can two zero have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of newtwo zero facilities reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand two zero they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is an open retail two zero market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman dtwo zero at lower prices than today california should fully open its retail market reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves fromtwo zero volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer two zero term fixedprice basis the state has instead left procurement in the han dstwo zero of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market two zero opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the irtwo zero price risk restoring the financial integrity of the statezero one s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills this has led totwo zero greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to two zero arrive at lasting solutions california must permit its utilities to recov ertwo zero their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and two zero distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is two zero needed just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that two zero while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters two zero worse price caps have been proposed they donzero one t work have never work edtwo zero and they will not work here price caps succeed

theyre not necessarily winwin the middlemen arranging these settlements take cuts also if john lives hes without his life insurance policy and few insurers will want to insure him as hes been so sick

_________________________________________________________________ investing basics in the margins if youre new to investing youve probably stared at an income statement sometimes called a statement of operations and scratched your head wondering what its telling you let us help first understand that the income statement summarizes sales and profits over a period of time it might cover three months or a year for example it will usually offer information for the yearago period as well so you can compare the two and spot trends heres a slightly dated but nevertheless interesting example lets look at eskimo pie corps income statement for fiscal year one nine nine eight at the top as with every income statement youll find net sales sometimes called revenues for eskimo pie theyre six three five million from now on as we work down the income statement various costs will be subtracted from the revenues leaving different levels of profit the item youll find just under revenues is cost of goods sold abbreviated as cogs and sometimes called cost of sales which represents the cost of producing the products or services sold for eskimo pie its three seven four million subtract the cogs from revenues and youll get a gross profit of two six one million to find the gross profit margin simply divide the gross profit by revenues two six one million divided by six three five million yields a gross margin of four one percent compare results with industry peers for example at a similar time gross margin was three five percent for ben jerrys which has a somewhat different business model next the remaining costs involved in operating the business such as support staff salaries utility bills and advertising expenses are subtracted leaving the operating profit eskimo pies operating profit is one eight million divide this by revenues and you get a slim operating margin of two eight percent this reveals the profitability of the companys principal business ben jerrys four three percent finally after items such as taxes and interest payments are accounted for we come to net income near the bottom of the statement eskimo pies is zero eight million divide that by revenues and you get a net profit margin of one three percent ben jerrys three percent the last part of the income statement is where the company divides its net income by shares outstanding to arrive at earnings per share

give it a try the adaytum implementation is a corporate project managed under the project sunrise umbrella joe darensburg is the lead reporting to jan johnson both of these people are originally from corp accounting i believe jan has moved back into the corp accounting group and the overall project is now reporting to susan bellinghausen from the isc ets has its own project which is being led by tracy geaccone ets consolidations which reports to rod hayslett i believe this was originally set up to address ets specific planningforecasting needs and to dovetail into the corp level implementation hoang vo is an adaytum consultant working for tracy lee baker manages planning and forecasting for the operations services group which reports to elaine concklin and is part of morris brassfields organization i believe elaine has a dotted line to rod as well lees team uses hoang quite a bit as well ill call you in a few minutes and we can discuss further greg original message from

is organized for etss adaytum projects one i understand teri g is project lead does she report to rod hayslett is anyone from steve hottes area involved two is the project being capitalized or one

mountain of email from piling too high with regard to the actuals item mentioned below this came to light when my team was doing research on developing cost center reporting out of the finacial data warehouse next wednesday we have a detailed planning meeting on requirements after which we will be asking the isc supports sap adaytum data warehouse etc for an estimate and schedule basically what we are shooting for is plan in the data warehouse to support cost centervariance reporting and actuals in adaytum to support analysis and development of current estimates and forecasts i call you

fred cc boggs phil perchal cheryl peters jerry subject adaytum status one one two zero zero one i am out of the office tomorrow and wanted to get some communication out on the adaytum om project i havent had a chance to talk to phil on this so this is only my opinion on the project so far this will just be a brief rundown i can expand upon any of the items at your request planned this week call hoang vo on a couple issues see accomplished below decipher what rita accomplished in the model and what still needs to be completed understand the model accomplished this week called hoang vo on one one one nine issues one cant open large cubes hoang knows this is a problem there is a similar issue with a houston application which they need to redesign two importing to contributor after allocations ran hoang is working on a script he will send to us once he has it finished until then we could do it manually but hoang would have to step us though this process taking away from his time writing the script side note if we cant get the allocations back to contributor then the users me right now cant do much testing besides inputting documentation phil and i have been going through dlists and dcubes trying to determine the purpose of each discovered some dlists and dcubes that we may not need and documented questions on others this written documentation should assist new users of our application cube renaming we have renamed the merit sbp model to just merit model this is the only bright spot in the week as renaming cubes seems to be a simple process with the name change occurring in all the appropriate places for links and macros to still work outstanding issues phil and i have come to the conclusion that we need further assistance from hoang or another consultant familiar with this application we are in need of a summary manager build and some sort of documented process on how to run this application i am not at all comfortable with the application in its present state but feel we can make some progress if we had a complete roadmap of the application and someone to ask questions of in a phone conference this afternoon we were told that getting actuals into the adaytum om application would not be ready for january two zero zero two close ets thought that the whole actuals process was being addressed under the project sunrise umbrella which is not the case now ets must champion this effort it is being headed up by greg lewis but there is not an estimated completion date deb xseven eight three one not everything that can be counted counts not

consolidating power generation market in asia pacific enron asia pacificafricachina enron apachi is proposing to enter into a transaction with marubeni and sithe asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company newco newco would be charged with making the shareholders investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders respective stakes in newco the shareholders believe that newco must not be seen by the market as a dumping ground for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in asia as a result enron apachi proposes to include competition restrictions in the marubenienron shareholder agreement that would bind their respective affiliates the following is a summary of these competition provisions enron affiliates with the exceptions stated below could only develop or own power projects in the asia pacific region as defined below after first offering the opportunity to newco if newco declines the opportunity enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve development or ownership does not include the provision of construction om offtaker or risk management services there are a number of exceptions to this rule a small projects involving two zero mw or less b projects in which enron owns less than a one three interest c projects initiated by our sk joint venture d korean projects using natural gas produced by enron e projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which asia generation is less than two zero of the value of the acquisition and f situations in which any enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction affiliates will be defined to exclude enron affiliates which are publiclyowned eg azurix asia pacific region will be defined to include brunei china including hong kong and macau south korea north korea taiwan vietnam laos cambodia thailand myanmar the philippines malaysia indonesia east timor singapore papua new guinea and the pacific

from the local guys were back we are also lost for words to describe our thoughts about last weeks attack we may have more to say over time at this stage we would like to refer our readers to the lehman brothers website for a message from richard fuld the chairman chief executive officer of lehman brothers httpwwwlehmancom lehmans research impact calls portfolio strategy jeffrey applegate after september one one two zero zero one the dreadful events of this week will probably push the us economy and profits further down to a v bottom the profits recession will now also be deeper than our forecast of one two with a trough in third quarter the dreadful events of this week will probably push the us economy and profits further down to a v bottom the profits recession will now also be deeper than our forecast of one two with a trough in third quarter but the vicious nature of the attack has prompted a vigorous monetary and fiscal policy response at a time when the sp five zero zero is more than three zero below fair value we expect that the stock market will rally on primarily cyclical leadership banks update the expectation of aggressive rate cuts by the federal reserve board and sec actions to ease share repurchase restrictions should help many large cap bank stocks we highlight bac c fitb fbf jpm and wfc following tuesdays tragedy the us government took steps to increase liquidity to the financial system and provide additional sources of support for stocks the federal reserve provided liquidity and is expected to reduce rates aggressively while the sec took actions to facilitate reopening of fair and orderly equities markets the ramifications of these actions should include wider net interest margins increased mortgage refinance activity and an acceleration of share repurchase activity some of the companies that would seem to benefit immediately from these actions include bac c fbf fitb jpm and wfc q our strategist jeff applegate recommends almost a double weighting of financial stocks three two vs a market weighting of one eight mid cap banks we expect the fed to aggressively lower interest rates during the remainder of year we view nfb and sotr both of which are down one seven over the last two trading weeks as liability sensitive plays ftn mtb and bbt should benefit from large mortgage banking operations the recent weakness in bank stocks and the easing of restrictions should cause companies to increase share repurchase activity companies in this camp include cbss fmbi hban nfb and tcb our one rated stocks are cyn cbss cfr nfb tcb and zion we view mtb and sotr as trading buys at current levels midcap banks tend to do well in a low inflation low interest rate environment which our forecast calls for the wildcard however continues to be the economy electric utilities ct dpuc draft draws a blank ct dpuc releases draft decision that denies fcel two six mw project entirely reducing shares of fcel to market perform from strong buy due to lack of material catalysts and potential downside to eight share late wednesday the ct dpuc issued a draft decision that denied funding to an enecrra proposal that would have resulted in a two six mw order for fuelcell energy while the draft decision could be adjusted to provide funding in a final decision early october the wording of the order appears to point the companies towards additional state funding vehicles which would likely take multiple months to tap and would be speculative at this point we believe the disappointing ct dpuc draft decision leaves shares vulnerable to the downside eight share and likely caught in a lower trading range until sub mw and mw launch size order flow can be generated that said fcels seven share of fully diluted cash and leadership in carbonate technology should limit downside even in the current market environment electric utilities gray growing weaker in round one zero the ca senate failed to reach agreement on a revised sbseven eight xx and therefore failed to call a vote at the end of the legislative session we maintain our market perform rating on shares of eix the ca senate failed to reach a compromise on a bill to avert bankruptcy for eixs utility sce in the wee hours of the session although the major terms of a revised deal were intact the senate lacked the votes to bring a successful vote gov davis has called for a third extraordinary session in early october to try to force a compromise bill through both the assembly and senate as anticipated consumer opposition remained the sticking point but surprisingly gov davis lacked the political might to force the measure through the senate we maintain our market perform rating on shares of eix as we continue to believe the nearterm earnings and valuation are limited even if a bill ultimately passes major pharmaceuticals charles butler timing of xigris panel restrictions we are raising our peak sales estimate for lillys sepsis drug xigris to two six billion from two zero billion the lilly sepsis drug xigris was scheduled to be reviewed at an fda panel last wednesday due to the tragedies in both new york and washington the panel did not convene however documents were made available on the fda website regarding lillys presentation and the fdas interpretation some have interpretated from the fda documents that while xigris will be approved it may have a more restricted label thus reducing potential demand q we spoke with two members of the xigris team on friday and have concluded that we do not believe a restricted label for the product will occur leisure felicia rae kantor a mixed bag we fully expect the leisure segment to be under pressure in the first few days of trading fears of travel coupled with economic concerns do not bode well for the industry in general in this note we offer subsector by subsector a rational and logical snapshot of our universe with the hopes of helping investors reassemble the pieces of the puzzle after the terrible tragedy that occurred on nine one one pc software neil herman software sector in light of last week the events of last week increase the risk that potential customers will delay

with sales and production likely to be disrupted gm and ford hampered by low level of profitability and weak balance sheets before the tragic events of last week are vulnerable from a financial standpoint with access to credit likely to be more difficult than anticipated aggressive monetary and fiscal policy as well as military action could set the stage for an eventual economic recovery perhaps as soon as late two zero zero two in the mean time business is likely to be extremely difficult based on the stock price action during the gulf war we expect a significant near term drop in

stressed to the limit by last weeks wtcpentagon disaster by enormous traffic levels while some facilities were damaged companies predicted no material impact to overall business conditions as a direct result the utility of wireless service showed itself in a very dramatic fashion in multiple situations and we may see some above average activation levels in the short run the impact of a sustained

to share repurchase we rate nfb one strong buy with over eight five of its revenues derived from spread income and projected aggressive fed actions in the nearterm we expect solid results to continue despite disruption in the manhattan marketplace we expect nfb to increase its share repurchase program by five mm shares bringing its authorized repurchase to eight mm shares this represents five of

very brief analysis of governor daviss two nine zero one executive orders below is a brief summary of the five executive orders issued by governor davis on two nine zero one for those of you that want the cliff notes version these orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things one expedite siting for new powerplants and expansions or modifications of existing powerplants two maximize output and minimize outages at existing facilities three centralize authority andor mitigate issues impacting powerplant siting and construction the tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting powerplants and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full capacity ie the carrot and the stick they also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators to sell their power under contract to the state dept of water some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will be how much capacity is truly idling and will be able to be brought back on line or increase its output will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create flexibility within the framework allowed by the clean air act in order to positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction and operation how quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given the other issues in ca we will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders but wanted to get information to you in a timely manner dtwo two zero one increased outputexpedited siting mandates cec exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power generators limited to less than five zero mws using existing installed capacity bw zero six zero one one zero zero one zero one expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed thermal powerplants action by the state water resources control board to insure wastewater issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating requirements for the state dept of water resources to purchase power from powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not other market for their power expires one two three one zero one unless extended analysis this order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are currently not operating or not operating at full capacity it does not waive air quality requirements they are addressed in a separate order dtwo three zero one appropriate maintenance and efficient operation requirements iso requirements require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the iso prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide those records to electricity oversight board conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the iso consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the iso requires that the electricity oversight board review the iso tariffs and protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the isos ability to ensure adequate power during peak demand instructs the cpuc to ensure that generation facilities still owned by utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability requires the electricity oversight board to propose legislation to expand its authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est benchmarks for availability and performance and issue fines against those plants after a hearing analysis again the tone of this order is that the state wont tolerate outages as an excuse for not generating it is also an attempt to better manage planned outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants where offline for maintenance at the same time dtwo four zero one air pollution flexibility and mitigation measures mandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities that provide power under contract to the dept of water resources are not restricted in their ability to operate requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable emissions in excess of the previous limits if air districts do not comply the board carb shall impose modifications on the permits in lieu of districts the board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions reductions from all available sources credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the summer peak season in two zero zero one in the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to the dept of water resources ca will make available where necessary and available the required emissions credits at up to a five zero percent reduction in order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to facilities where necessary and available proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the new or expanded facility is located expires one two three one two zero zero one unless extended analysis this order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the dept of water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an

committee california state senate room two zero eight zero california state capitol sacramento ca nine five eight one four dear senator dunn earlier this year you met individually with iep and various other parties to explain the purpose of the senate select committees hearing and the process under which they were to be conducted you made it very clear that you were planning to have factfinding hearings based upon fundamental fairness and due process you made a further commitment that there would be no surprises prior to today the hearings have been conducted consistent with that representation unfortunately today it appears that the committee has set a new course that radically departs from these previous commitments today the committee is hearing testimony from several surprise witnesses these witnesses are former employees of san diego gas and electric sdge under contract with duke energy for an interim period during which duke energy operated the facilities in san diego it is our understanding that these former contract employees are alleging that the company failed to properly maintain these facilities and they are alleging that duke energy cycled these facilities differently than the former owner sdge it is also our understanding that duke energy will not be afforded the opportunity to contemporaneously challenge these allegations andor provide an explanation as to the operational behavior of the facilities in short the hearings are being reduced to a media event giving credence to the unsustainable allegations of disgruntled exemployees respectfully it would appear that the committee has wandered far afield of its stated goals these hearings have the potential of identifying what went wrong with californias energy policy and how to fix it however this will only occur if this inquiry is based on informal facts and complete information not innuendo and unsubstantiated allegations it is the pursuit of facts not headlines which will solve californias energy crisis these facts will be revealed only in a fair process where allegations made are subject to contemporaneous response it is our hope that todays process is an aberration and not a departure from your commitments the committee is at a crossroads it can choose to engage in factfinding and analysis or it can be reduced to a witchhunt in pursuit of headlines for the benefit of all californians the committee should focus on factfinding and analysis sincerely jan smutnyjones executive director,12:10:00,No

regarding your offer certain of the following information is drawn from historical data as to the plant nothing below is a representation as to the plants operability on a goingforward basis one why is the proposed guaranteed availability seven five so low in the nonsummer months at the quoted monthly demand charge epmi feels that the guaranteed availability values are competitive please note that seven five represents a guaranteed availability and actual availabilty will be targeted at a much higher level major maintenance would be completed during the nonsummer months two how do you propose that availability be calculated we propose that availability will be calculated using the following formula aaf pc d mpc where aaf actual availability factor for a given month p the number of peak hours in a given month where peak hours are he seven two two sunday through saturday ie seven days a week c the contracted quantity for that month in units of mws d the number of unit hours declared by epmi not available in the peak hours of that given month times the maximum contracted capacity of that unit m the number of mwhs called on by buyer in the peak hours of that given month but not delivered by seller for that month note both d and m would exclude the major maintenance outages see below scheduled outages see below outages due to force majeure buyers inability to perform including but not limited to nonavailability of gas andor gas transport and epmis inability to operate the plant due to legal regulatory or permitting restrictions or other reasons beyond the reasonable control of epmi one major maintenance outages mo the seller would be allowed two five days per year per unit to conduct major maintenance mos would not count against the actual availability factor see calculation below seller may only schedule mos with at least a one zero day notice and only during the months of october november december march andor april two scheduled outages so the seller would be allowed seven two hrs per month per unit to conduct scheduled maintenance sos would not count against the actual availability factor see calculation below seller will make commercially reasonable efforts to schedule sos during nonpeak periods weekends and nights seller may only schedule sos with at least a two four hour notice note that the guaranteed availability factor gaf would be set at nine five for the summer months and seven five for the other months the contracted full demand charge fdc for any given month would be paid by the purchaser to the seller as long as the actual availability factor aaf is equal to or greater than the gaf nine five or seven five for that month for any month in which aaf falls below the gaf of nine five or seven five depending on the month the purchaser tva would pay the seller epmi a prorated amount of the fdc using the formula below this prorated amount is known as the reduced demand charge rdc notice that an aaf of five zero or less for any given month would result in a floor reduced demand charge of two kwmo for that month adc two fdc two gaf five zero aaf five zero as long as aaf is equal to or greater than five zero and less than or equal to the gaf either nine five or seven five adc two kw for months in which aaf is equal to or less than five zero adc fdc for months in which aaf is equal to or greater than the gaf where adc actual demand charge for a given month fdc full demand charge for a given month aaf actual availability factor as defined below this number is given as a whole number eg nine seven is nine seven gaf guaranteed availability factor nine five all percentages are rounded to the next highest whole number eg nine four seven becomes nine five nine four four becomes nine four two is the plant winterized that is can it run in the cold weather significant upgrades were made to the plant after the one nine nine nine calendar year to aid in winterization in general however even fully winterized plants tend to be less reliable in extremely cold weather it would be buyers responsibility to address natural gas availability and delivery concerns throughout the year including winter months three from a manpower standpoint is the plant available seven xtwo four for all months or are the certain periods of time when the plant is not staffed the plant is staffed or has members on ready recall seven xtwo four however in order to have full preparation time a three hour notice is required prior to dispatch dispatch outside mf peak hours five xone six he seven two two requires a five hour dispatch notice four what has been the historic availability of the plant by month using the formula above the actual availability factor aaf for the plant by month for calendar year two zero zero zero is shown below jan one zero zero feb nine nine mar one zero zero apr one zero zero may nine seven jun nine seven jul nine nine aug one zero zero sep one zero zero oct one zero zero nov one zero zero dec one zero zero note that approximate average per unit run hours during calendar year two zero zero zero was two one five hours five what type of gas transportation has been historically used interruptible or firm historically epmi has utilized both firm and interruptible gas transportation depending on availability six has the plant ever been unavailable due to the inability of fuel only once since plant construction this occurred during a runtime with minimal advance notice in general fuel availability is the responsibility of the buyer and is more readily available with greater advance notice note also that the plant was only minimally run during the most recent winter season due to noneconomic dispatch conditions therefore the availability of gas this past winter was not tested epmi is willing to discuss with buyer making the facility a dual fuel plant subject to permitting restrictions and operational parameters and effected at buyers expense seven am i correct in assuming that in the tolling type arrangement tva has exclusive use of the plant that is enron would not have access to the output unless tva specifically waives its rights epmi would not have access to specific units of the plant while those units were being dispatched by tva the plant has six units and four would be designated by unit number to tva for purposes of the tolling agreement epmi could call on units not being dispatched by tva from rogersherndonenroncomsmtprogersherndonenroncom sent thursday january zero four two zero zero one two two two pm to goza

a bid solicitation for the new albany tolling service we anticipate sending this proposal to interested parties by the middle of next week one one zero zero one in the event epmi and tva have not

status update on the issues surrounding continental power volatilities and correlations as you know for some time we have been trying to get the continental power traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option portfolio and for use in calculating their var as it has been obvious that the market has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in their mark in looking at the impacts of this various other issues came to light firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the var model as this was way out of date we have worked with jitendra and have now put in a matrix that both the traders risk and rac are happy with secondly as you may be aware in portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the deal ticket and not off any volatility curve the current portfolio is nine zero swaptions and so this represents a serious issue for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change we cannot use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options we also have not found any way in portcalc of valuing asian options so we are having to force in the few we have we have had the houston based portcalc it team work on a new piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of worrying bugs these are primarily that the proposed code does not take the correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of approximating the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the underlying they are currently being hampered in that they do not have any it personnel who have sufficient option knowledge i understand that the two most experienced coders resigned to go to another houston based energy company this is extremely worrying and i find it hard to believe that the whole of enrons power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the volatility at the deal ticket level this will almost certainly mean that different volatilities are being used in the var as are being used to value the swaption portfolio globally as well as these issues we have concerns over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in portcalc worryingly it does not seem that you can switch this off briefly it seems that portcalc calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the forward price of the underlying itself we have engaged london based it and are looking at the code we have used in power nine nine to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book asian options once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or gamma risk from portcalc in its current state as the information is just no there so we are told by it the system seems we cannot be one zero zero sure given all the other errors to produce a vega and gamma pl number but what the risk is remains a mystery again this is very worrying in that we have power option traders all over the world who cant get their underlying vega or gamma risk position from the global valuation system we are trying to work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but i would really like to know how the american based traders cope as they have this problem knowingly or not for years what sign offs were gained for the implementation of enpower because it seems to us that using the current system it is not possible to comply with the global risk policy how do we validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their var however as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily remark as jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their model vol curve generator i have today asked for a full explanation details of any testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle the swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility i would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been covered in houston some time ago and could do with some help we are having to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and are having to spend an enormous amount of it time overcoming the inadequacies of enpower wich i do not think most people are aware of consequently we have not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in gaining the increased limits so three months ago but i would hope you agree that it is not for a lack of trying sorry its so long but if there are any questions or any perceived inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know james,00:54:00,No

enron had used profits from its derivatives trading operation which was little understood by investors to mask losses in its more visible businesses even as some of its employees may have been fraudulently manipulating those profits enron reaped huge profits from derivatives but it lost billions on most everything else it did including projects in fiberoptic bandwidth retail natural gas and

distributed energy resources industry won a major battle yesterday the california senate energy and utilities committee passed on a seven zero bipartisan vote sen morrows and while her name wasnt on this bill it was as much sen alperts bill on eliminating any tariff that discriminates against der sbx nine was derived from the omnibus der bill sbx three five which is still alive and contains many important provisions fro removing additional barriers yesterdays vote represents a major win because even if the bill ultimately does not get enacted a very important statement has been made by the committee im sure the cpuc will take notice in their proceedings the der community owes much thanks to sens morrow and alpert and the utilities committee members and their staffs sen bowen chair sen alarcon sen battin sen dunn sen murray sen poochigian sen sher sen speier sen vasconcellos sen vincent also much thanks to everyone who worked incredibly hard and diligently on this effort from the business consumer advocacy environmental government manufacturing and real estate communities here are the highlights of yesterdays actions one for ious no discriminatory tariffs for new der installed between may one two zero zero zero and june one two zero zero three if der is in combined heat and power mode if you have a peaking unit with gen only then you have until july one two zero zero one to get it installed two der installed within the window gets the exemption until june one two zero one one three the maximum capacity of the der is five mw in aggregate per site four the der must have emissions levels of nine ppm or better until the arb established new guidelines and standards expected late this year or early next year five customers with der are still required to pay interconnection public purpose charges and obligations incurred under the dept of water resources energy purchases program six the cpuc shall require the electrical corporations to include nonutility owned der in its planning process seven the cpuc is required to establish a firewall so that in the event that the implementation of der results in net costs to the system those costs stay within the customer class eight the cpuc shall require the utilities to establish new rates for der that are nondiscriminatory and take into account the benefits as well as the costs nine munis are required to review their tariffs for barriers to entry and hold public meetings to solicit comment for recommended changes now we have momentum but there is still a tremendous amount of work to do on the assembly

both you and mike while he was in london i told mike that i support many of the ideas of commoditylogic however i also told him about my two darkside fears one that it resources reporting to networks would make it even more difficult to get the attention on projects that we need and two taken to the extreme that this concept would disinsent operations personnel from coming up with creative solutions to managing the growth of the business if all good ideas are swept away to this special team for them to handle part of the fun in operations is improving things and i would hate to rob some of our most knowledgeable people of the chance to implement creative business solutions richard sage zero eight one one two zero zero zero one zero one zero am to mike jordanlonectect cc sally beckhouectect steve whitakerlonectect subject commoditylogiccom mike further to our conversation here are some of the things i thought of while speaking with tom gros there are definitely some challenges we have to overcome to make the hub idea within commoditylogiccom as successful as enrononline rather than have it turn out like sitara i wont repeat thoughts about how we split cl from enron but lets put ourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a potential solution well thats an easy decision somebody else is doing the hard work and not charging us very much for it so signup but dont rely on anything until we see everything working handling counterparties not using the system the challenge here is that the final solution world with overybody using the hub is wonderful but until everybody is using the hub we have to keep other procedures and systems going which stretches resources development it support and user this was why we decided to delay getting bolero the concept is wonderful but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone else one trades with using the system this is classic chicken and egg tom has a vision of cl providing the staff to handle this this is taking us closer to an outsourcetoandersenconsulting model which is certainly achievable although not quite such an easy sell how much resource is left the latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people who are therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving onwards how about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to cl and then review what is left in the remaining environment does it mean we hold off doing anything if we do then increasing volume means that we might end up incurring costs for massive numbers of people we should go through costing for what happens if we completely stop development of x project if that shows one would need two zero zero clerks for three years until something else comes along then it may be cheaper than developing but i hope in most cases it is not start small to prove concept eg first application in april two zero zero one only covers two zero fields this is excellent and we neednt shout it too loud to investors in cl but for our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be years before we can switch off many internal systems we might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to three years out include european aspects from the beginning this really isnt very difficult so long as one has some longoncommonsense europeans not just brits involved in both specification and development from the beginning but an as example of how not to do it look at enpower which took a year to allow just for currencies etc eight zero two zero rule for types of transaction eol has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first once we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting dtl and risk risktrac numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on stp and yettobecomevanilla products on explicitly different manual approaches until that time we have a strong desire to include as many different prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system which makes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly think of certain deals in powernine nine which are approximations of the actual deals and manually tweaked every so often testing toms first thought is that we could leverage initial users who would not pay to do much of the testing eol clearly got its testing done but other experience shows that in order to have anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different phases component system integration endtoend and then useracceptance eol saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many external users early in the process it did have massive resourcecommandability and so obtained input from many traders do the support functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the same sort of user attention given how often i hear short people that strikes me as something which in london would require significant additional resource even after mg is absorbed what else did you come up with richard,04:27:00,No

quicker but this transaction presented different issues than past cases helman asked suggested that we may need to propose conditions limiting anticompetitive gas vs electric practices financing helman asked how nng will finance the one five five billion cash portion of the purchse ackerman responded that she would provide detail on the terms and conditions of the csfbmerrill financing other regulatory review helman asked whether the sec would be reviewing the financial condition of the holding company we responded that the sec would not be focusing on the financial condition of the

zero zero one san francisco chronicle url httpwwwsfgatecomcgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchivetwo zero zero one zero five three one m ntwo three one two three five dtl sacramento legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for southern california edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at the expense of its biggest customers the plan would leave manufacturers refineries and other big industrial customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utilitys three five billion back debt through a dedicated charge residential and small commercial users would be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of edisons debt but supporters of the plan say its these users that wanted deregulation and should shoulder the costs it created were trying to put something together in a way that solves all these problems and if people are to be pigheaded about it we wont solve any problems said assemblyman fred keeley dboulder creek santa cruz county although the plan is an alternative to gov gray davis proposed deal to put edison back on its feet financially it could be used as a model to help restore pacific gas and electric co to solvency democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by republicans but gop lawmakers object to saddling large business users with edisons debt the plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into core and noncore users separating core users under this proposal electrical users would be divided the same way core users would be customers who use five zero zero kilowatts or less a month noncore would be those using more than five zero zero kilowatts out of edisons four two million customers only three six zero zero would be noncore customers but those three six zero zero customers use about two six percent of edisons demand for energy core customers would get their power from generators owned by edison long term contracts and alternative energy producers such as wind farms and solar panels on contract with the utility that would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of the spot market which has far higher prices than other sources of electricity large users the noncore customers would be given the right to negotiate to buy their power directly from generators or build onsite power plants to make themselves energy selfsufficient the plan would be phased in through january two zero zero three to give large energy customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market during that period residential small business and large industrial users would all share in paying off edisons debt but in two zero zero three that burden would shift exclusively to the big users republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be given what is called direct access to generators so they can negotiate cheaper rates enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users because that would create a builtin market for the energy the company sells large users who want to remain on the grid could do so edison encouraged sources said edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out details of the plan a spokesman for edison said he was encouraged by the talks i havent seen a finished product or a plan said bob foster a senior vice president with edison theyre approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and trying to find a solution big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now there is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity were very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years said dj smith a lobbyist for the california large energy consumers association when you add blackouts the multiple interruptions of production and another potentially huge rate hike the result would be catastrophic to the economy smith said added dorothy rothrock a lobbyist for the california manufacturers and technology association whats the rationale for the noncore to be paying the entire edison undercollection it sounds to me like just pure politics they dont want voters to pay because they vote consumer advocate smells a rat harvey rosenfield head of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of edisons debt onto residential and smaller commercial customers i think its a trick weve seen this same tactic used at the public utilities commission where what were supposed to be rate increases for big business end up costing more for residential and small businesses rosenfield said the new plan also does not include the outright purchase of edisons part of the transmission system that loops electricity around the state davis backs buying the lines for two seven billion democrats have insisted that for the states financial help taxpayers receive something of value republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state purchase of transmission lines in the new proposal the state would have a fiveyear option to buy the transmission lines for one two billion the book value of the asset in addition the utility would make one five billion available to the state to either purchase other assets such as edisons hydroelectric facilities for example or use it in partnership to build new power plants email greg lucas at glucassfchroniclecom two zero zero one san

Wilson Criticizes Gov. Davis - Editorial from
 Sacramento Bee, Sunday June 3, 2001",deregulation not to blame but davis is his inaction allowed a problem to become a power and fiscal crisis by pete wilson published june three two zero zero one the plain and simple reason california will inescapably suffer hundreds of hours of blackouts this summer is because california will not have a sufficient supply of electrical power to meet demand five years ago when deregulation was passed by unanimous vote of both houses of the legislature and without a murmur of dissent from any democratic constitutional officer including thenlt gov gray davis california enjoyed an excess of supply over demand amounting to some three zero percent deregulation was enacted to create free market competition first to drive down what were then among the very highest power costs in the nation and second to attract private power providers to invest in the creation of new generating capacity to meet the exploding power needs of the new economy and keep in california all the jobs that it would produce and deregulation did succeed in stimulating a significant increase in applications to build power plants especially after the effective date of the legislation in one nine nine eight and the defeat that year by california voters of prop nine which unwisely sought to repeal deregulation the total megawattage of the filings for one nine nine eight doubled that for one nine nine seven after the effective date march one nine nine eight of the deregulation legislation ab one eight nine zero and the defeat of proposition nine november one nine nine eight removing the threat of repeal the total for one nine nine nine was double that of one nine nine eight exceeding the five zero zero zero mw mark in nine nine alone just look at the filings for one nine nine seven one nine nine eight one nine nine nine and two zero zero zero in the california energy commission graph above far from causing the problem of energy shortage as the davis administration charges deregulation caused providers to file by midtwo zero zero zero applications to build new power plants that promised to add one zero zero zero zero megawatts to californias power supply thats why i signed it i did so even though i disagreed with two of the provisions of ab one eight nine zero just as i and every other governor in history signed other bills which though imperfect promised significant and needed beneficial change from the status quo which was certainly true of deregulation no one could have anticipated in one nine nine six the combination of factors less hydroelectric output in the west warmer summers sharply higher electricity demand constraints on natural gas supply that turned an electricity surplus into an electricity problem by two zero zero zero the reason we will suffer power blackouts this summer is because the davis administration has by inaction allowed a problem to become a crisis now the power crisis threatens to become a state fiscal crisis governor davis has been quoted as saying if i wanted to raise rates i could have solved this problem in two zero minutes sadly by temporizing on needed actions to raise rates and other steps required to avert crisis he made crisis inevitable as a result california bonds have suffered two downgrades by wall street rating agencies and he has put in jeopardy state spending for parks schools transportation and other capital needs he has been warned by the state legislative analyst to sharply reduce the state budget the administration failed to monitor either the explosive growth in electricity consumption by the new economy in the last five years which gobbled up the energy surplus that existed at the time of deregulation or the curtailment of production of natural gas which led to price spikes in recent years it failed also to heed early warnings from weather forecasting agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century it ignored a one nine nine eight warning by the california energy commission of possible energy shortages by as early as two zero zero zero and when possibility became hard hot reality in san diego in two zero zero zero it continued to ignore it putting in place a political palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem fully a year ago or earlier had he chosen to do so governor davis could have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of california by the state government code to deal with an emergency including explicitly the sudden and severe shortage of electrical energy these powers include the suspension of statute and regulation it was this power that i used after the northridge earthquake in one nine nine four to rebuild and reopen los angeles shattered freeways just six four days after their destruction instead of taking the two and one half years that would otherwise have been required by law fully a year ago davis could have acted unilaterally without the legislature to suspend operation of the rate cap that the investorowned utilities pge sce and sdge recently complain of but eagerly requested at the time of enactment he could have by decree suspended the provision that prohibited the utilities from forward contracting with power wholesalers he could have by executive order suspended and truncated the nightmarish process required by state law for approval of siting had he done so early enough when he might even have made a difference this summer and done so not just with peaker plants but also with large plants he might have greatly accelerated construction of the power plants that will be required to allow us to escape from blackouts power price spikes and the severe job loss and economic injury certain to result from a power supply that is neither reliable nor affordable all these actions governor davis could have taken a year ago or earlier a governor can foresee the emergency and exercise his extraordinary powers to prevent it he is not required to wait and compel california to suffer it had the governor heeded the early warnings about hot weather or the threat of insolvency to the utilities and had he acted using the full range of his extraordinary emergency powers when he should have he could have prevented the problem from becoming the crisis it has become we might have incentivized power providers to build enough new plants fast enough to avoid blackouts this summer pge would not have been compelled to declare bankruptcy and southern california edison would not be teetering on the brink energy costs would not have spiked to the present outrageous levels the state would not have burned through billions of taxpayers dollars and californias jobs would not be threatened as they are by raiders from other state governments who are aggressively seeking to lure california employers to their states and steal our jobs the blame game waged by the governors office adds insult to injury it will provide no comfort to californians sweltering in darkness this summer but it does do a serious disservice to ratepayers and taxpayers by seeking to mislead those who are not aware of the real unhappy facts of californias present crisis the honest explanation for it is simple not rocket science state government cannot ignore the law of supply and demand it is not the states responsibility to build power plants but it is its responsibility to create a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers to do so deregulation even with imperfections that the governor could have cured by fiat if the need arose was a significant advance in achieving that incentive as subsequent filings by providers attest the problem grew into a crisis not because of deregulation but because of governor davis failure to act that is the plain unhappy truth of the matter i take no joy in saying so i have been prepared to be helpful to the governor during this very serious challenge to our states wellbeing just as when i responded to his request for my assistance in passing proposition three nine the school bond issue in the most recent election just as my perception of what was best for california caused me to help him then i am compelled now to speak out to prevent the rewriting of history and a deliberate effort to mislead the public and to discredit deregulation in order to shift the blame for his own inaction pete wilson is the former governor of california you can see this story at httpwwwsacbeecomvoicesnewsvoiceszero five html,06:14:00,No

for the skins he caught three passes for five six yards and a touchdown against dallas and now has a score in three of his last four games although he isnt a solid starter fryar could still be useful to fantasy owners in deeper leagues bobby shaw wr pit free agent updated one two one one zero zero shaw led the steelers with eight eight yards on six receptions with one of them going for a touchdown however his performance was deceiving as he also dropped two other key passes keep that in mind as he prepares to go up against washington next sunday as the steelers might not go to him as much as a result james thrash wr was the lie downs updated one two one one zero zero thrash caught five passes for six two yards in washingtons three two one three loss to the cowboys on sunday thrash has been jeff georges favorite target this season so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season if your league uses three starting wideouts considering making thrash your number three man will blackwell wr pit free agent updated one two one one zero zero blackwell made his first two catches which went for two three yards total in more than a year during sundays game against the giants he played two games prior without a reception after missing the first one one games of the season by being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery dont take this as a sign of things to come for blackwell hes a marginal receiver over the final two games wane mcgarity wr dal free agent updated one two one one zero zero mcgarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in dallas three two one three win over washington he has no fantasy value at this point of the season jason tucker wr dal free agent updated one two one one zero zero tucker was held without a catch against the redskins on sunday but did run a one seven yard reverse for a touchdown the young dallas receiver has no fantasy value at this point in the season kris brown k pit free agent updated one two one one zero zero brown missed two field goals during sundays game against the giants he missed tries from three six and four four yards out marking the first time in his twoyear career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game dont start brown during your fantasy playoffs albert connell wr was fdic updated one two one one zero zero connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the cowboys he has only one three catches in his last six games and is still being bothered by a knee injury avoid starting connell at this crucial point in your fantasy season anthony johnson rb jac free agent updated one two one one zero zero johnson suffered a sprained toe late in sundays game against arizona he rushed for three nine yards on one three carries after relieving fred taylor johnson was walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to play next sunday against cincinnati james mcknight wr dal the lie downs updated one two one one zero zero mcknight was the only dallas wideout to catch a pass on sunday hauling in two balls for five eight yards against the redskins with the cowboys quarterback situation up in the air avoiding all of dallas receivers is a good idea rjay soward wr jac free agent updated one two one one zero zero the jaguars suspended soward for sundays game against arizona and several team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting he has made several similar violations and was demoted to the no three receiver during a october two two loss dont count on any fantasy numbers from soward the remainder of the season larry centers rb was the fat bastards updated one two one one zero zero in his typical role out of the backfield centers caught five passes for five four yards in sundays loss to the cowboys at this point in the season centers fantasy value is minimal at best so starting him now is a huge risk jaguars dt jac the snake pit updated one two one one zero zero jacksonvilles defense posted a solid outing sunday against arizona allowing just one zero points and one eight nine net yards brant boyer helped lead the jaguars d to an interception and four sacks on the day the performance by this unit has been among the leagues best in recent weeks despite a rash of injuries we expect more solid numbers as jacksonville takes on cincinnati next week so look to this unit during your playoffs michael wiley rb dal free agent updated one two one one zero zero in his first game as dallas third down back wiley ran for three eight yards on one one carries the rookie from ohio state will see more playing time in the weeks to come but doesnt have any fantasy value at this point stephen davis rb was meximullets updated one two one one zero zero davis had a surprisingly modest game against the cowboys this week rushing for only five seven yards in dallas three two one three victory although he did score a touchdown davis also fumbled twice leaving some to believe that his forearm is still hindering his ability to hold onto the ball look for the skins to try and establish davis early in next weeks game against the steelers as washington looks to keep their slim playoff hopes alive kurt warner qb stl risk managers updated one two one one zero zero warner regained his earlyseason form sunday completing two seven ofthree two passes for three four six yards unfortunately many fantasy owners were probably eliminated from the playoffs after his fourinterception debacle last week if you are one of the owners that survived keep warner in your lineup and ride him to fantasy glory jeff george qb was the snake pit updated one two one one zero zero george was a disappointment to fantasy owners who picked him up for this weeks game against dallas the veteran quarterback completed one nine ofthree three passes for two three five yards and only one score in the game george will remain the starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on saturday against pittsburgh whose secondary was blasted by the giants kerry collins this week marshall faulk rb stl fdic updated one two one one zero zero faulk was a fantasy juggernaut sunday rushing for four touchdowns he gained one three five yards on two five carries and added six catches for four three yards with his performance sunday he reaffirmed himself as the best fantasy running back travis prentice rb cle murder inc updated one two one one zero zero prentice scored two oneyard touchdowns during sundays game against philadelphia and had four six rushing yards on one seven carries on the day he also bruised his right calf although xrays were negative although these numbers are more promising were not optimistic prentice will help your fantasy team when he goes up against tennessee next sunday cris carter wr min fear updated one two one one zero zero carter had seven catches for six six yards in sundays game against the rams he will have another formidable test against the packers this week but carter will be up for the task he struggled in their first meeting but still managed to make five catches for five nine yards and score a touchdown randall cunningham qb dal free agent updated one two one one zero zero cunningham was listed as the thirdstring quarterback in sundays game against the redskins because of a nagging groin injury when troy aikman went down with a concussion anthony wright replaced him in the lineup leaving cunningham on the bench with dallas starting quarterback situation up in the air for next week fantasy owners should avoid starting cowboys quarterbacks all together dennis northcutt wr cle free agent updated one two one one zero zero northcutt alternated with doug pederson at quarterback during sundays game against philadelphia although he did not attempt a pass he had seven carries for three seven yards rushing and five catches for four four yards receiving in the game unfortunately northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of the game despite the decent yardage totals he wont have enough fantasy value to help you at this important stage of the season randy moss wr min mean machine updated one two one one zero zero moss was held to four catches for six four yards and a touchdown sunday look for moss to have a better game against the packers this week he had six catches for one three zero yards in their first meeting this season giants dt nyg free agent updated one two one one zero zero the giants defense continues to be solid holding their last three opponents to two four combined points this week opponent the dallas cowboys could be without both troy aikman concussion and randall cunningham groin leaving thirdstring quarterback anthony wright to man the ship dallas offense has struggled for most of the season so the gmen should hold the boys in check for most of the game unless you own a defense with a better matchup fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the giants d this week

under fundamental conditions that appear to be unsupportive of increasing prices although students of the laws of supply and demand would require a shift in production consumption or other economic variables to revise their assessments of natural gas prices market technicians see the situation from the standpoint of only analyzing price behavior or variables derived from price movements i look at a number of different tools but there is a beautiful down trendline that projects lower prices says an oklahoma city analyst the big debate as prices move up is that although there are overlapping technical patterns the current rise may be the fourth wave higher of a five wave pattern down and there is one more new price low coming the counter to that argument is that if prices reach and hold above two five zero prices will not make that final fifth wave down and that there is a bigger rally coming a close over two five zero per mmbtu not just a trade over two five zero is one issue that we are studying carefully he said prices maybe at a pivotal point it will be key to see how prices handle themselves in the mid two four zero s theres a very good chance that prices will retreat to the low two two zero s i am in a negative mode on this market but if we close above the trendline at two five zero then i will take a neutral to positive stance on this market check out free trial of

model and prepare comments overall the participants though that the current foothills model zero four three mm btu toll for alaska section has very aggressive assumptions in many ways and it is very likely that the toll will be increased significantly after a ll the appropriate revisions are made the following are the main discussio n points of the meeting item one and two are expected to have a very large imp act on the toll one capex and opex need to have annualmonthly escalation current model has zero escalation for example foothills sensitivity analysis shows that two five capex escalation would increase the toll by zero two zero numbers such as one five f or capex and two five for opex were thrown during the meeting but more reviews need to be done regarding appropriate escalation rates do you have any op inion on this bryan two foothills is using flowthrough method using cash taxes in cos calculati on to calculate income taxes that go into the cost of service and might be underestimating cost of service tim thought that the flowthrough method w ill not fly because of previous cases in which that method was not allowed by irs and ferc foothills said that they can still have same toll under no rmalized tax method by changing the depreciation number but tim was concer ned that it might force the partnership to record negative depreciation fo othills declined our request to share their cost of service model and insis ted that we calculate the toll ourselves based on the information in the ca sh flow model they agreed to provide a hard copy of their cost of service model in the end but tim and i were under impression that foothills was tr ying to lower the toll as much as they can tim was also concerned about le velized toll approach because of ferc might lower allowed return in the lat er rate cases and more analysis needs to done regradign this please correc t me if i am wrong here tim three om a is currently estimated to be one of capex but this might be too lo w oma in more latest cost estimate by foothills is approx one five of total capex four the withdrawn partners historical contributions two two eight million will be added to the rate base but this might be dropped if necessary success fee of four zero million should be included in the project budget five working capital will be added to the project cost the line pack cost one four five bcf for the whole section was assumed to be borne by ans producers but some participants highly doubted that that would be the case the line pac k gas might have to be bought by the partnership or the producers will at l east demand certain return on their gas sitting in the pipeline for two five year s six for return on capital and afudc one four roe and eight interest on debt assumin g three zero seven zero capital structure is likely to be kept however the current drawdo wn schedule assumes construction financing available from the very beginnin g which will not be true certain assumptions should be made on the financ ial close date and commercial agreementpreliminary determination date to c alculate afudc more accurately seven current financing assumption in the model is a two five year bank loan with ba lloon amortization and dscr of one six in reality the initial bank loans will be of shorter maturity five one five years and certain rollover financing will

the wall street journal atwo copyright c two zero zero one dow jones company inc diplomats from around the world gather in bonn starting today to address a seminal question will there be a kyoto protocol on global warming without the us or none at all the key player in answering that question appears to be japan whose position may well determine whether other industrialized nations move ahead despite the bush administrations vigorous opposition the kyoto protocol will be the central issue at a united nations convention which initially was intended to complete the pact after talks in the hague broke down in november over relatively minor differences between the european union and the us since then however president bush rejected the treaty as fatally flawed throwing its future into doubt the protocol brokered by former vice president al gore in one nine nine seven and later signed by former president clinton requires industrial nations to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other gases thought to be warming the planet by five two below one nine nine zero levels the bush administration wants an alternative that is less punishing on the energyintense us economy and that imposes tougher requirements on china india and other fastdeveloping nations president bush on friday announced a series of steps to reduce the impact of heattrapping gases in lieu of the kyoto protocol the president unveiled a one two zero million national aeronautics and space administration project to study climate modeling among other things the department of energy meanwhile has signed two agreements to study carbon levels and the white house also awarded two five million in grants for similar studies elsewhere finally the department of treasury started a one four million forestconservation program in el salvador still the us turnabout on kyoto continues to shock europe and european leaders vow to go it alone to wait for the us is to wait for someone who has refused your invitation european environment commissioner margot wallstrom said this week but under the terms of the protocol the europeans need ratifications from industrial nations that emit five five of the developed worlds greenhouse gases and european nati ons dont account for that level of reductions themselves reaching that amount without the us isnt possible without the support of russia and japan japans position is most up in the air and it accounts for eight of total emissions japans environmental minister yoriko kawaguchi paid a series of lastminute calls on us cabinet officials on friday japanese officials want the kyoto protocol to come into force but they appear reluctant to take a position against the bush administration to push its case the eu has spent the past two weeks trying to build a constituency around the world to put the protocol into effect a move that would allow key provisions to acquire legal force such as an international emissionstrading system and penalties for noncompliance ms wallstrom visited asia and australia last week and british deputy prime minister john prescott was in tokyo on thursday the eu strategy has been to offer to make it easier for these wavering countries to sign up for example the eu was previously reluctant to allow sinks such as forests which soak up carbon dioxide and hence reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases to be counted toward national targets for emission reductions but in a bid to win support from key countries especially japan it is now offering more flexibility on sinks paula j dobriansky an undersecretary of state who will lead the us delegation said the us will not block other nations that want to pursue the protocol but it will intervene in bonn if the talks affect other us interests we plan to be very active and constructive in that regard the bush administration is still studying alternatives to the treaty meanwhile us companies are divided on the protocol eileen claussen head of the private nonpartisan pew center on climate change has formed a group of three six major companies that includes dupont co enron corp weyerhaeuser co and boeing co to argue for action on global warming while they dont agree on every aspect of the kyoto formula she explains they all want to get this process started in a way that spreads out the pain but gets something done meanwhile the global climate coalition whose membership includes the us mining industry the national association of manufacturers and other large industrial trade associations supports the bush antitreaty stance taking more time to discuss the protocol says glenn kelly its executive director will continue the kyoto quagmire and allow diplomats to continue to collect frequentflier miles copyright two zero zero

zero seven one six two zero zero one the new york times page four column one c two zero zero one new york times company earlier this year forrester research the internet consulting firm predicted that the universe of businesstobusiness emarketplaces would shrink to a mere one eight zero in the next two years from one zero zero zero or more today it was a bleak forecast but one that surprised few who had watched such sites search in vain for customers in two zero zero zero the shakeout is proceeding apace with the rate of mergers and failures picking up where the consumer ecommerce sector left off but just as some survivors have begun to emerge from the consumer ecommerce rubble so too have some of the socalled btwo b marketplaces started to show some staying power in recent weeks pantellos an online marketplace for the utilities industry said it had handled nearly two zero zero million of transactions since it rolled out in january chemconnect an online chemicals exchange recently crossed the one billion mark in transactions handled so far this year intercontinental exchange a trading site for electric power gas and oil said it had handled more than one zero zero billion in trades in the one zero months since it opened these companies and a handful of others analysts said have managed to attract buyers and sellers by broadening their service features beyond the typical marketplace site which heretofore had focused mainly on the concerns of buyers while buyers have run to this fairly quickly suppliers havent said matthew sanders a forrester analyst most of the businesstobusiness marketplaces mr sanders said were created with the premise that if a corps of powerful buyers in a given market gathered on one site the suppliers would come running even if that meant the suppliers had to engage in auctions in which they underbid one another for the right to sell their wares but attributes that go beyond price like quality service the stability of the brand warranties all the things suppliers build around their products marketplaces havent allowed them to offer mr sanders said chemconnect for one has countered that trend said michele b hincks the companys vice president for marketing ms hincks said the site had set up an online exchange floor where five zero zero zero to seven zero zero zero companies negotiate to buy and sell specialized chemical products the site lists companies that are interested in buying or selling certain types of chemicals and then sets them up in passwordprotected negotiation rooms where they can deal with such issues as product quality warranties shipping and price in exchange for enabling such negotiations ms hincks said chemconnect charges annual subscription fees of three zero zero to more than one zero zero zero zero zero according to a recent report by gartners gartnergtwo a business strategy research firm emarketplaces will broaden their offerings even further in the coming months to rely on a wider spectrum of business services like supplychain collaboration and demand forecasting in the case of esteel such services now dominate the companys business plan michael s levin esteels chief executive said that about a year ago the company changed its focus from a typical emarketplace to that of a software seller that also operates an online marketplace for heavy industries companies like ford motor and bhp the australian miner mr levin said told us in their own way that enabling a transaction online is interesting but insufficient and that we had to do more than that for them to become clients so esteel developed software that the companies now use to help integrate their manufacturing processes with those of their suppliers using the web among other things the software permits ford to track and manage the manufacturing steps that begin when it orders steel from a supplier the software helps ford move the steel to plants for processing while accounting for the different specifications for rolling the steel stamping it and moving it to various processors and assembly plants mr levin would not say how many clients esteel had for the software which costs each customer millions of dollars a year and requires multiyear contracts nor would he disclose revenue figures for the company which is privately held but he said the company had two years worth of money in the bank and way before that probably within one five months well be cashflow positive as for the sites marketplace mr levin said it still had value but only as part of a much more powerful set of tools and for serving as a place for attracting prospective software clients analysts and executives also pointed to the role of experienced and independent management for whatever success some emarketplaces had experienced so far lauren jones shu research director at gartnergtwo said those were not advantages shared by many of the socalled industry consortium marketplaces which are owned by a collection of the major participants in a given industry emarketplaces like covisint and exostar which are owned by some of the biggest companies in the automotive and aerospace industries respectively are examples of consortiumowned sites but ms shu declined to say whether she thought the ownership structure of those particular sites was a handicap still ms shu said a lot of them have agendas that are too large and are trying to cater to the various needs of different members apparently at least one emarketplace owned by an industry group pantellos has avoided paralyzing its management pantellos an online exchange that is owned by two one large utility companies was cited by mr sanders the forrester analyst as one of the few emarketplaces to find success this year the site caters to utility companies and energy service companies like general electric helping utilities and power companies build and manage power plants for example and offering a forum for suppliers of those services to compete for business the business is growing quickly said graham collins the companys chief executive virtually all of our operating metrics are doubling every two weeks he said mr collins attributed that growth in large part to the fact that the two one companies with ownership stakes in pantellos did not have a direct say in how it operated thats allowed us to stay focused on the interests of our memberships not the parochial interests of the shareholders he said theres nothing more mindnumbing than to attend meetings where you have to vote on whether or not you should vote luck of course has played a role in the early success of some online exchanges perhaps most notably in the success of intercontinental exchange which in april announced it would buy europes largest offline energy exchange the international petroleum exchange jeffrey sprecher chief executive of intercontinental exchange based in atlanta said the core of the sites technology was refined between one nine nine four and one nine nine seven but at that time mr sprecher said absolutely no one in the electric power gas and oil markets wanted to trade in the forward and futures markets online everybody thought they were already getting the best prices he said and they feared that posting prices on the web would destroy that competitive advantage then in october one nine nine nine enron started buying and selling these products online and the whole argument about pricing went away mr sprecher said shortly thereafter he offered equity in his site to one three market makers like bp and goldman sachs in exchange for commitments to use the site for trading i got lucky in that i built this before the internet revolution mr sprecher said the last years been amazing compared to the early years which involved a lot of sitting around photo the dofasco steel company is an investor in esteel and one of its strategic customers employees at the dofasco operations in hamilton

producers charged state far more than private mark martin lynda gledhill chronicle staff writers zero seven one six two zero zero one the san francisco chronicle final aone copyright two zero zero one from the start of the states energy meltdown gov gray davis and many lawmakers have cast private outofstate energy companies especially those in texas as pirates plundering californias economy but a chronicle analysis found that some of the most expensive megawatts california bought during the bleak winter months actually came from what many would consider to be sympathetic traders publicly owned power producers the chronicle study of spot market purchases shows that as a whole public agencies in california and elsewhere charged an average of about three four four per megawatt hour during the first three months of the year while private companies charged less than two five zero more than eight zero percent of the power sold by public agencies was above the two six nine per megawatt hour average that california paid all power providers less than a third of the power from private companies exceeded that average i think anybody who ripped off the state ought to be investigated said harvey rosenfield head of the consumer group foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights a publicly owned utility shouldnt be prospering from this crisis and those munis that did ought to immediately forfeit any excessive profits yet like with everything in the power crisis not everything is always as it appears and public utility officials say theyre hardly to blame for the skyhigh electricity prices interviews with operators of publicly owned power providers paint a picture of state department of water resources electricity buyers sometimes so desperate to avert rolling blackouts that they didnt haggle over price dwr called us and said were looking for power at five zero zero a megawatt hour for a sevenhour period said kate hora a spokeswoman for the modesto irrigation district which delivers power to nine five zero zero zero customers in the central valley there was no negotiation we just helped them out at the price they named pete garris chief of operations for the dwr department in charge of buying and selling power said something like that would not have been typical munis provide reliable energy i could see offering five zero zero per megawatt hour when the market was trading at six five zero he said one thing munis do for the most part is provide reliable energy if they say they are going to deliver so many megawatts they are going to deliver but that reliability can be expensive much of the public power was hydroelectric from the pacific northwest usually delivered at expensive peak demand hours and municipal agencies say they were forced to press into operation old inefficient generators state officials would call and say we need the energy said ignacio troncoso director of public service for glendale water and power we didnt really want to give it to them because it meant using some very inefficient turbines but they said they needed it sometimes it cost one zero zero zero or two zero zero zero per megawatt hour but they paid it s david freeman davis top energy adviser said the state bought a relatively small percentage of its power from municipal utilities and it was at a time when the state was getting nearly all of its electricity in the volatile spot market two zero from public agencies about two zero percent of the power purchased by california in the first quarter of two zero zero one came from publicly owned agencies in the united states canada or mexico you have to consider the volume said freeman whose hiring in april was controversial because he headed the los angeles department of water and power los angeles charged california on average two nine two per megawatt hour for power before he joined the state in april freeman said los angeles rates were based on cost plus one five percent i dont say were angels but were being neighborly he said then were not giving you a cup of sugar were selling it but not at exorbitant prices like los angeles canadas publicly owned bc hydro sold more than eight zero zero zero zero zero megawatts to the state in the first three months of the year at aboveaverage costs spokeswoman elisha odowichuk said the utilitys rates to california were higher because of delivery costs but the utility made enough money to give their canadian customers a one three zero rebate davis wants eight nine billion back davis has demanded eight nine billion in refunds for electricity prices the state says were excessive the state estimates that it is owed about six zero zero million from the municipals michael kahn chairman of the board of the independent system operator said last week the state is hoping that the federal energy regulatory commission will order private providers to issue refunds but the commission has no jurisdiction over municipal utilities at least one offer was put on the table by municipal utilities and is under consideration said steve maviglio spokesman for davis if no deal is reached the state is prepared to go to court he said anybody who is on the list of price gougers we intend to seek refunds from he said why public power cost more energy experts suggested several reasons why public power may have cost the state more than electricity offered by enron duke and other private companies the state probably bought most public power during peak usage hours in the evening or during days when rolling blackouts loomed said severin borenstein a professor with the university of californias energy institute in berkeley thats how the modesto irrigation district briefly got into the business of selling power to the state the district sold one seven five megawatts to california on feb one three for five zero zero per megawatt hour the district bought power from an oregon utility for three seven five per megawatt hour and delivered it to the state from one to seven pm during a stage three power alert the state avoided blackouts that day seattle city light earned on average the most per megawatt hour of any public utility getting a price of six three four but an official there also said there were no negotiations with the state the utility had a contract to deliver electricity to three five nordstrom stores in california state power grid officials determined that the stores werent using all the power and then snapped up the excess for what is referred to as the clearing price the highest price paid for electricity during that hour seattles charges defended but seattle isnt rolling in money because of its dealings with california the utility has raised rates three times this year spokesman dan williams said modestos and seattles experiences are probably similar to other public utilities said michael shames of the utilities consumer action network based in san diego the munis did make a profit he said but theres no evidence that los angeles or any other city made the same kind of skyhigh profits that the dukes of the world did we havent seen any municipal utility officials taking expensive vacations because of the crisis shames suggested that public utilities high rates may not have been as high as private companies offers when they state energy officials got really tight the private companies were probably offering to sell at exorbitant prices he said state was no charity case still several publicly owned agencies acknowledge that they didnt treat the state department of water resources as a charity case when the state was desperate for megawatts burbank officials would look for power on the open market and sell it to the state if they could make a one zero percent profit to cover such things as

it had been unfairly battered by political winds its since gone up back down and back up again finishing friday at four four five three so now might be the time to take a look at its longerterm prospects looking several years out its worth listening to the skeptics and to how calpine responds to them the gentle breezes of doubt and it has to do with an england acquisition of all things come from an organization called creditsights wwwcreditsightscom which analyzes companies with bondholders in mind because calpine has issued so many bonds to finance its expansion what the bondholders think makes a difference no other company in silicon valley not even cisco not anymore has quite the scope of ambition of calpine cpn the independent power generator with offices in downtown san jose if you live in the valley you may know the company best for its gritty and now apparently successful fight to establish a power plant off metcalf road in san jose if you live in california you may know about its intricate dance with pge over whether they would be paid for two six six million of unpaid bills but these are only a few glimmers in the klieg lights of its ambitions not everyone is singing hosannahs a recent report by creditsights analyst dot matthews was a goodnews badnews review of calpine first in a development she said was probably most important she hailed the recent agreement with pge that would allow calpine to collect the two six six million owed to it the market has greeted this news with acclaim sending up calpines stock by about seven a share or about two zero percent since the news of the agreement broke early this month but in creditsights view another piece of news from calpine was unsettling the announcement that the company was paying eight zero zero million to acquire the new one two zero zero megawatt saltend power plant near hull england its first overseas acquisition this is disappointing for two reasons matthews wrote first the plant is in englandwhich is a difficult place for american companies to make money in power production distribution second we are starting to see a pattern develop where calpine appears to be buying plants that other savvy players dont seem to want we are concerned that calpine may be expanding at any price so it can keep up the earnings growth that fuels its stock quote the creditsights report went on to note that both enron and entergy etr which built the saltend plant are selling generation facilities and that there is no shortage of power in england so what is calpines response i talked with calpine senior vicepresident ron walter who says the acquisition of saltend a stateoftheart gasfired plant is part of a longterm plan to expand outside the continental united states and canada calpine has said its also looking at possibly expanding in italy and spain the growth in england is certainly not what the growth is in this country walter said but because of the unique nature of this plant we feel its going to do extremely well in this marketplace walter points out that enron a heavy trader of energy has a very different business plan than calpine which has stayed a manufacturer and he says that entergy wanted cash out of its saltend plant and to the charge of expanding too fast walter insists with justification that calpine has demonstrated nimbleness today in building two nine power plants at once we spend all our time looking at each market at the age of plants and what the competition is doing he said we pick the targets that make sense its a good response and investors who have stayed with calpine have been amply rewarded the stock has gone up two two fold since its ipo nearly five years ago but its hard to dismiss all doubt history teaches that an empire inevitably

given greater impetus in the uk when the new electricity trading arrangements netas were introduced in march this year the neta system is a wholesale market which allows companies to balance their books when they trade power electricity can be bought and sold according to a variety of factors such as how it is generated and when it is used utility companies can use power trading to better manage their price risks for example by buying gasgenerated electricity on the market if the costs of generating their own energy from other sources is too high as well as speculating on future prices companies can generate additional revenues by selling riskmanagement services to smaller utilities and other firms sssb believes traded volumes of electricity in the uk will eventually be five times the actual consumption of the country it says innogy which owns the retail business npower is slightly ahead of powergen in the powertrading market companies can use power trading as a clever way to add value to their existing assets said daniel martin a utilities analyst at sssb if they are successful i can see five zero zero million euros potentially more added to their value but he said the

presidents focus engineer finds self in spotlight eyes of bush critics turn to key adviser if the message blurs dana milbank washington post staff writer zero seven one five two zero zero one the washington post final azero four copyright two zero zero one the washington post co all rights reserved karl rove the political brain who brought president bush to the white house is all about focus you really have to focus he would say during the presidential campaign now as bushs senior adviser he says his biggest worry for the administration is losing focus so why is it that roves name is often the one mentioned these days when the white house message is blurry last week rove popped up in the context of an arrangement between the white house and the salvation army over a regulation the charity sought to exempt it from workplace bias laws based on sexual orientation before that rove attracted attention for his role in the bush decision to suspend navy practice bombing on the puerto rican island of vieques in what was seen as a bid to appeal to hispanic voters then there was the episode in which rove participated in policy discussions that could have affected enron corp and intel corp two companies in which he has substantial holdings rove has become a lightning rod for critics of the administration turning up when theres a controversial matter the white house would rather avoid when sen james m jeffords vt quit the republican party roves pressure tactics came into question in discussions over stem cell research rove has been present voicing worries that federally funded research using human embryos would cost bush antiabortion roman catholic voters in everything from judicial appointments to policy toward sudan rove has made his presence known why the bullseye on roves forehead partly its because rove by choice is involved in most everything the white house does its also because hes a political adviser rather than a seasoned government official so his actions regardless of motive seem tainted to some outsiders liberals are eager to demonize him because he is the white houses principal liaison to conservative interests and rove for his part enjoys a largerthanlife reputation and seems to relish combat the embarrassments that have come from roves actions demonstrate the pitfalls of having a political strategist in a dominant position in a white house but roves omnipresence also gives the president assets that bush allies say have made the bush presidency successful rove ensures that the president keeps the crucial backing of his conservative base hes the one conservatives feel comfortable in calling and feel that when they air their concerns theyre speaking to a guy who understands their language said ken connor of the conservative family research council roves white house colleagues say the senior adviser is merely doing his job by working with constituencies its a completely bogus rap bushs deputy counselor daniel bartlett said of the rove criticisms its part of karls core responsibility to speak with these outside groups some former clinton administration hands said rove five zero is making matters worse by involving himself so visibly in so many issues when youre in the middle of a new administration and come to town you have a big bluedot target painted on your back said james carville bill clintons top strategist in one nine nine two it seems karl has tried to paint his orange he seems to sort of welcome the fire former clinton staff chief john d podesta said that while carville did not take a job in the clinton white house rove is applying the anythinggoes rules of politics to governing youve got a white house political director who seems to have enormous influence on issues of life and death like stem cells podesta said his range of authority is over things normally done by the chief of staff or the national security adviser but bushs outside strategists said keeping a political animal in his inner circle is the presidents source of strength gop operative ralph reed said clinton would have been better off putting carville in the white house when the senior political strategist to an incoming administration is pushed to the periphery it often has devastating consequences reed said had lee atwater lived and had the role in the first bush white house that karl rove has in this administration i personally believe that administration would have had a better shot at reelection last weeks salvation army flap shows the pitfalls of having a top political adviser like rove so heavily involved in policymaking but it also shows how rove has been able to secure for bush the crucial support of the gop right during his first six months congressional staffers said they heard two different messages coming from the white house over the faithbased initiative john j diiulio jr and his white house office of faithbased and community initiatives they said was seeking to build a consensus among lawmakers including democrats the legislation retained the one nine nine six charitable choice laws prohibition on proselytizing while requiring groups to make any religious activity voluntary and separate from the program funded that change impressed rep barney frank dmass they did write it in very strong language that says you cannot use this money to do anything religious he said but some conservatives balked at the change arguing that charities would be even more restricted than under the one nine nine six law whats sad about it is bush is laying out the principles very well but the details belie the principles said marvin olasky an original architect of bushs proposal who has become an opponent this makes it worse makes it more difficult for any evangelical or conservative catholic or jewish group to be involved while diiulio irked some conservatives another group of white house officials including rove sought to please the right by pushing the measure through the house even as it stalled in the senate this infuriated democrats its been very clear that on the one hand john diiulio and his staff want to get a bill done and are reaching out to democrats to reach consensus a democratic aide said on the other hand the white house legislative strategy does not seem to reflect that kind of cooperative spirit but conservatives were soothed michael horowitz a scholar with the conservative hudson institute who opposes the faithbased initiative because he says it would dilute churches spirituality said diiulios office has the worst strategic judgment but rove has compensated for that what the white house badly needed was somebody to keep in touch with its conservative base horowitz said karl rove anchors them to his base and hes superb at that his sympathy for the conservative base is extraordinary the salvation army sought to benefit from that sympathy when a lobbyist it hired who was friendly with rove asked the senior adviser for help rove asked the office of management and budget to look into the request the white house rejected the proposal last week when the request and claims from the salvation army of a firm commitment to act on it became public as it turns out house republicans working with several white house officials had already made changes to the house legislation two weeks ago that gave the salvation army most of what it wanted protection from cities domestic partnership benefit requirements this protection comes in a provision allowing all grant programs covered under the faith bill to be turned into vouchers indirect assistance through vouchers rather than a city contract would spare the salvation army and other religious groups the burden of the domestic partner benefits said ira lupu a george washington university law professor house democrats also argue that the law indirectly allows gay hiring discrimination in a provision that says a religious organization will be free from state and local interference in the definition development practice and expression of its religious belief democrats have been muted in their complaints about such provisions but there was no such restraint when it came to roves involvement in the initiative particularly over the salvation army flap terence mcauliffe the democratic national committee chairman fired off a statement demanding rove come clean wrote mcauliffe the white house is arrogantly evading questions about its backroom deals and hiding the part played by bushs top aides mary matalin a senior bush aide said mcauliffe cannot argue with the legislation on the merits so is using rove as a target its his inability to engage on issues she said for terry to succeed they need to create villains they had newt gingrich ken starr and tom delay

copyright two zero zero one six months after californians were stunned to find their winter heating bills soaring by hundreds of dollars energy companies are moving ahead with plans to build pipelines into the state that could lead to a flood of cheaper natural gas and give consumers a break at least eight companies have proposals in the works to build interstate pipelines running thousands of miles from gas fields in canada the rocky mountains and the southwestern united states to california the california economy is very strong and its going to continue to grow and expand said jim macias of calpine corp which is developing plans for a pipeline that would run from the southwest to a terminal in antioch we have adequate pipeline capacity for today but we have to build capacity for the future the prospect of vastly increased pipeline space for natural gas coupled with a building boom in california of gaspowered electricity plants could head off crises such as the one that beset the state last winter as the weather turned cold tight space on gas pipelines meant big heating bills for customers and huge debts for utilities and the state that had to buy electricity produced by gasfired plants insurance against blackouts gov gray davis has touted the brace of new plants as californias insurance against blackout threats and price increases just in the past month davis has thrown the ceremonial switches on three new power plants in california all of which run on natural gas california is building its way to total energy self sufficiency davis said monday at opening

least one six will come online by two zero zero four is being repeated across the nation by states equally attracted by the environmental benefits and potential cost savings of gas those states will want to tap into pipelines being built across their territory for their own needs said joe benneche a forecasting expert with the us energy department coastal states such as california and florida might not get their fill from the leftovers they are at the end of the line benneche said it does make them more vulnerable and even as they welcome the added megawatts from new power plants some california officials are wary of hitching the states energy future to market players that have interests in both natural gas and electricity these are horizontally integrated companies that are deciding every day based on arbitrage spreads whether they are going to sell a megawatt or a molecule of gas said loretta lynch president of the state public utilities commission studying gas price history at the states urging federal officials are looking into why gas prices at the california border leaped last winter to levels as much as one zero times the national average state regulators have accused el paso corp a texas energy firm of restricting gas shipments through its pipeline into the state to raise prices something el paso denies generators said the price runups for gas justified equally huge increases in the price of electricity they sold to the utilities and later the state and even as blackouts loomed some firms like el paso upheld their right to divert fuel from generators and sell the gas instead if the price was right lynch said the state needs to come up with better ways to prevent companies from manipulating the price of gas to increase inventories and to promote competition so prices stay under control even some industry officials are urging caution over the rush to natural gas as the fuel source for as much as nine zero percent of the countrys new generation it makes sense to maintain a balanced portfolio said neil brown a spokesman for pseg power a newark nj firm investing in both natural gas and coalpowered plants one of the reasons california did experience problems was its reliance on gas and hydroelectric power disruptions in both those sources contributed to supply problems although geological research indicates that north american gas reserves should be adequate for five zero to seven zero years that doesnt protect individual regions from temporary shortages that can cause devastating price spikes said benneche the energy department forecaster the key to preventing those shortages is to build enough pipelines on time to meet the need he said waitandsee attitude although energy firms including enron el paso and sempra energy are talking about a range of projects to supplement the five major interstate lines into california only two pipelines so far have received final approval or have been completed said bill wood a gas expert for the state energy commission some companies will wait and see what demand looks like before making a final decision on whether to build he said they dont want to overbuild wood said you only get paid for what you use but maintaining extra capacity for use by competing gas marketers is essential to hold down prices wood said otherwise he said a limited number of marketers holding pipeline space can jack up rates taking a cautious approach pacific gas and electric corps gas transmission affiliate pipeline has applied to expand its capacity from canadian gas fields to the oregon border by about one zero percent most of that will probably be siphoned off by new gasfired plants in washington and oregon wood said but the rising demand is attracting new players aside from traditional pipeline companies operating in california san joses calpine sees a robustenough market to invest in its own pipeline project if only to fuel the one two zero zero zero
