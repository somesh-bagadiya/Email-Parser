message from allan david sent tuesday july two four two zero zero one one one zero seven am to causholli monika subject re foex index yr two emails very interesting email did you send to jim bryja original message from causholli monika sent tuesday july two four two zero zero one one zero four two am to allan david hutchinson elizabeth subject fw foex index yr two emails guys here is what i got from timo teras at the foex on their methodology in calculating the pix monika original message from timo ters mailtotimofoexfi sent tuesday july two four two zero zero one one one two nine am to causholli monika cc tuulafoexfi subject re foex index yr two emails hi monika welcome to the pulp and paper world in order to understand the index system the first thing is to look at our website wwwfoexfi which includes a lot of information particularly in this case the faq section you probably have taken a look at that already though our two pulp indexes nbskp northern bleached softwood kraft and bhkp bircheucalyptus cover the european market as abt four zero of the world pulp trade is for the european market these are in a way considered to be the world market prices particularly as the third biggest market north america asia is the second biggest has virtually the same prices as europe correlation between the two is well over zero nine the sellers reporting to us are by definition in nbskp from canada us west coast and the nordic countries bhkp birch euca sellers are from the nordic region latin america spain and portugal and a number of asianafrican companies selling eucalyptus pulp to the european market buyers are european producers of paper and paperboard buying at least some of their pulp from the open market representing virtually all countires in western europe the split between birch and euca is approximately three zero seven zero again reflecting the actual situation in the european market the exact coverage is difficult to calculate as some of the data received from buyers are from same deals which are reported by the sellers and some are not the producers reporting to us represent roughly eight zero of the supply to europe in the two benchmark grades most eight zero nine zero of the pulp sold in europe is socalled contract business this means that a buyer and a seller have an annual or multiannual contract covering the grades and volumes quantity rebates etc however prices are fixed also for contract business on a monthlyquarterly basis most of the pulp arriving continental europe or uk from abroad goes through consignment warehouses in places like antwerp rotterdam la pallice tilbury savonolivorno range etc as forwarding companies allow three zero six zero days of free storage buyers do not hold much inventory at their mills but take the pulp delivered by sellers in large shipments little be little by lorry rail or barge each delivery is invoiced separately and those invoice prices are the price reported to us before customer specific rebates prices are for prime grade pulp and for delivery during the current or latest for the following month the following comments are worth making our system is based on first taking off top one zero and bottom one zero of the prices received and only then calculating the index or rather benchmark values this way we avoid any clerical errors in the data received as well as any theoretical attempts of manipulation we have never detected any attempts we have a more or less equal number of prices received from buyers and sellers some we receive through agentsmerchantstrading houses usually mandated by a supplier to give us the price data if someone does not report their prices on a given week we can use the previous weeks data but only once prices are not volumeweighted in order to avoid the manipulation possibility and unnecessary weekly changes up and down because a supplier sold one week to large customers and next week to small ones prices are cif european port before customerspecific rebates again to avoid unnecessary volatility of the index at a time when prices remain unchanged also rebates are often given only afterwards eg when exceeding a certain tonnage threshhold and we cannot alter our indexes retroactively our index system is approved by financial regulators and by european community antitrust regulators dg iv and audited by pricewaterhousecoopers there is a group of independent experts case need as trouble shooters never have had any and never have received any official complaints about the index values participation is totally voluntary the main reasons for differences between the often compared foex indexes and pulpex quotations include a our prices are before customerspecific rebates averaging five six pulpex prices are net b our prices are for contract business pulpex prices represent the lowest spotlevels in a weak market and highest spots in a strong market c our price info is based on actual sales pulpex prices are expectations what the spot price might be in eg three months time d our price is for a prime quality within each benchmark grade there are surprisingly large differences between individual mill grades sold approved by a seller from a particular suppliermill whilst pulpex prices based on a delivery concept ie you do not accept the price offered to close a contract you can maketake delivery are prices in a particular inventory location three four alternative ones sometimes far away from buyers or sellers normal ports for any lot often unknownunwanted grade up to one one months and two nine days old goods this system tends to emphasize in the pulpex system the extreme prices up or down particularly in these early stages with low liquidity our indexes are trademarked products therefore their use for any commercial purposes is possible only with our permission to get that permission users pay us a small premium the main source of our income enron and foex indexes ltd have a contract bob crane has the details at your end i trust this is helpful i encourage you to contact us anew for any additional questions please find enclosed for orders sake our

various matters currently before the california puc the commission order stating that the utilities should absorb any difference between dwrs cost of power and the retail rate freeze is still technically in effect the order only applies however to the power purchased under the governors emergency order giving the state the authority to buy power the utilities have petitioned to modify the decision telling the commission that the easiest way to remedy the problem would be to vacate the order altogether but if the commission didnt want to vacate the order it would need to change the decision so that the ious dont eat any shortfalls the commission can act on the petition to modify whenever it chooses in addition it has a continuation meeting scheduled for this thursday and a regularly scheduled business meeting next week so the opportunity to act and fix the order is there if the commission wants to take it with respect to the cost of utility generation ie retained generating assets and qf contracts the commission has a set up a schedule that foresses a commission decision adopting an interim procurement charge on march two seven th there is another workshop scheduled for tomorrow to discuss the utilities proposals after which the utilities will be required to file formal advice letters with the commission those advice letters will form the basis of the process that the commission will use to ultimately arrive at a decision on the two seven th everyone participating in the workshops takes the view that customers will see a separate line item on their bills to cover the going forward costs that dwr incurs to buy power everyone participating in the workshops also takes the view that customers will be on the hook for dwrs costs and the commission will if necessary raise rates to ensure that dwr is made whole unfortunately the commission is not currently sending signals to show that it concurs with the folks participating in the workshops and until there is clarity on whether the commission will agree to pass through those costs enron and others will continue to have problems with dwrs credit as it applies to the rfp that we and others responded to last week next week begins the hearings to address the issues that commission started to examine began in the emergency hearings held over the holidays ie the utilities financial position turns proposal to net out the utilitities generationrelated revenues with the undercollection caused by the rate cap the date on which the rate has or will end etc recently turn modified its testimony in response to the passage of abone x turns new position is that the commission should find that the rate freeze ended on february one st the effective date of abone x ees will need to quickly determine how and if it wants to respond to turns latest stance on the end of the rate freeze we continue to try to persuade stakeholders and the commission that da customers must be compensated for the fact that they paid for the utilities stranded generating assets that compensation could come in one of two forms one access to a proportionate share of the utilities retained costbased generating assets or two a credit representing the difference between the market value of the retained generating assets and the book value of those assets we are not getting much traction thus far the commission is scheduled to issue a separate decision addressing the rate freeze issue the issue of whether to net out generatingrelated revenues against the undercollection etc on march two seven so both sets of issues the procurement charges and the end of the rate freeze are scheduled to be finalized on march two seven albeit in separate orders with respect to the block foward issue our lawyers had a pretty good meeting on friday with the dwr general counsel and other dwr lawyers however it has become clear that despite those efforts fercs decision on charge backs will have a significant effect on the resolution of the block forward issue best jeff,05:23:00,"Yes

subject fwd can you believe it thought you might like this conveniently forgotten facts back in one nine six nine a group of black panthers decided that a fellow black panther named alex rackley needed to die rackley was suspected of disloyalty rackley was first tied to a chair once safely immobilized his friends tortured him for hours by among other thingspouring boiling water on him when they got tired of torturing rackley black panther member warren kimbo took rackley outside and put a bullet in his head rackleys body was later found floating in a river about two five miles north of new haven conn perhaps at this point youre curious as to what happened to these black panthers in one nine seven seven thats only eight years later only one of the killers was still in jail the shooter warren kimbro managed to get a scholarship to harvard he later became an assistant dean at eastern connecticut state college isnt that something as a six zero s radical you can pump a bullet into someones head and a few years later in the same state you can become an assistant college dean only in america erica huggins was the lady who served the panthers by boiling the water for mr rackleys torture some years later ms huggins was elected to a california school board how in the world do you think these killers got off so easy maybe it was in some part due to the efforts of two people who came to the defense of the panthers these two people actually went so far as to shut down yale university with demonstrations in defense of the accused black panthers during their trial one of these people was none other than bill lan lee mr lee or mr lan lee as the case may be isnt a college dean he isnt a member of a california school board he is now head of the us justice departments civil rights division ok so who was the other panther defender is this other notable panther defender now a school board member is this other panther apologist now an assistant college dean no neither the other panther defender was like lee a radical law student at yale university at the time she is now known as the smartest woman in the world she is none other than the democratic candidate for the us senate from the state of new yorkour lovely first lady the incredible hillary rodham clinton and now as paul harvey says you know the rest of the story pass this on she deserves the press

the pennsylvania public utility commission imposed today on its support for the companys planned application to provide interlata local access and transport area services in the state the company expects to file its application later this month with the fcc which under the telecommunications act of one nine nine six will consult with the us department of justice and the relevant state regulators before issuing a decision the state regulators role is to advise the fcc on whether a bell company has complied with the local exchange marketopening mandates of the act in a three two vote the puc told verizon that it must agree to a permanent performance assurance plan with selfexecuting remedies based on the new york model already accepted by the fcc the company also must withdraw its pending judicial challenge of the pucs authority to impose remedies aimed at preventing backsliding on local exchange marketopening commitments the puc said the company must agree to increase certain penalties from five zero zero zero to two five zero zero zero and the commission said verizon must agree to increase remedies for failing to provide accurate electronic billing to competitors the company could face payments as high as one zero zero zero zero zero per affected competitive local exchange carrier for missing an electronic billing standard commissioners nora mead brownell and terrance j fitzpatrick dissented commissioner brownell said i cannot in good conscience affirm that these markets are open as envisioned under the act both dissenting commissioners listed several areas in which verizon had failed to show that local markets are open to competition but colleen mccloskey senior vice presidentstate government relations and external affairs at verizon said she believed those concerns were addressed by the conditions the puc laid out ms mccloskey noted that new york massachusetts and pennsylvania comprise the lions share of verizon communications incs access lines verizon already is providing interlata service in new york and massachusetts winning approval in pennsylvania would mean the company is making substantial progress toward meeting an fcc requirement for verizons regaining control of internet backbone service provider genuity inc verizon spun that unit off last year as a condition of the fccs approval of a merger of bell atlantic corp and gte corp which formed verizon a worldcom inc spokesman told tr we agree with the puc dissenters we hope the fcc will recognize that problems still exist and force verizon to fix them prior to allowing it to offer long distance new commissioner abernathy seeks meetings with lawmakers fcc commissioner kathleen q abernathy still in her first week on the job already is sending letters to members of congress seeking meetings to discuss the commissions work in an interview today with tr she said she viewed her new role as an interpreter of congresss statutory mandate the public never has a chance to vote for fcc commissioners unlike members of congress she noted many of the predictions and assumptions made about the pace of technological and market change when the telecommunications act of one nine nine six was passed were wrong ms abernathy said but that doesnt mean the act has been a failure she added she cited increasing choices for consumers as one of the positive gains made since one nine nine six the commissioner who was directorgovernment affairs at broadband office inc emphasized the importance of information provided by congress industry officials consumer groups and state regulators despite her experience in various industry segments shes not an engineer or an economist she said she appreciates organized presentations and creative ideas she added see mondays tr for a full transcript of the interview two environmental groups challenge fccs antenna licensing procedures two environmental groups have launched an attack on the fccs antenna licensing process saying the agency should assess the direct indirect and cumulative effects before issuing new licenses friends of the earth and the forest conservation council issued their appeal in petitions asking the fcc to deny three three antenna license applications the groups say the environmental assessments prepared for those projects fail to include the information and analysis mandated by the national environmental policy act nepa council of envi ronmental quality regulations and fcc rules in addition applicants failed to meet the requirements of the endangered species act the clean water act and the migratory bird treaty act the groups allege the companies seeking permission to build the new antennas dismiss the charges they say their applications fully comply with applicable regulations the environmental groups fail to provide any specific justification or evidence against their projects and lack standing in the proceeding the companies say the groups challenge should be raised in a formal rulemaking proceeding they add of course the commission must consider and evaluate goodfaith challenges to environmental compliance american tower lp said in defense of its plans for a maryland antenna tower complaints as vague insubstantial and deficient as those in the present petition however are unfair waste already strained compliance resources of both commission and applicants and can cause serious harm to a given tower project or even to the overall industry through unnecessary construction delay and regulatory uncertainty a spokeswoman for the fccs wireless telecommunications bureau said today that agency officials were reviewing the environmental groups petitions tia partners with usaid to boost overseas telecom sales the telecommunications industry association has signed a memorandum of understanding with the us agency for international development usaid to help us telecom equipment vendors increase sales in developing countries usaid will provide access to its global technology network gtn which assists us small and midsize companies by matching prospective buyers and sellers tia said the agreement should increase the volume of new

2000-11-22,"[""'susan.scott@enron.com'""]","[""'drew.fossum@enron.com'""]",Re: gouging,as to your question about whats going on in california ive done some reading and here are my thoughts the nov one ferc order in docket no elzero zero nine five zero zero zero in which the commission ordered a one five zero mwh price cap among other things was predicated on the commissions authority under section two zero six of the federal power act specifically the fpa provides that if the commission finds that any rate charge or classification for jurisdictional services or any rule regulation practice or contract affecting such rate charge or classification is unjust or unreasonable the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate charge classification rule regulation practice or contract that should be in effect the commission recognized that certain areas of the flawed california market are not within its jurisdiction but fixed the areas within its jurisdiction apparently the california governor agrees with me that the commissions jurisdiction in the area of wholesale electricity prices is questionable in any event if the commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates its authority to do so would be much clearer the natural gas act expressly authorizes ferc to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just and reasonable just and reasonable has been interpreted in many different contexts and the commission has significant discretion over what it means as we all know too well the commission sometimes acts unpredictably however my feeling is that it will probably take more than two or three abovemaxrate contracts to motivate the ferc to act to declare a negotiated rate deal struck within a pipelines tariff authority to be unjust and unreasonable the california proceeding was initiated after entire communities of individual consumers suffered two zero zero three zero zero increases in their electricity bills the prices for electricity in california were outrageous across the board and affected everyone in the state by contrast tws transport rates for its shortterm deals are far removed from end user prices and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not widespread enough for anyone to notice it is far from being a consumer issue and besides the elections are over however as you and i have already discussed we must be wary of parties like dynegy that do notice just about everything and who might try to draw it to fercs attention we do need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving california are doing the same types of deals kathy why dont you and i discuss a system of monitoring the contract information postings of el paso kern pgtnw drew obviously ive only scratched the surface here so lets talk if you want a more indepth report from drew fossum one one two one two zero zero zero one zero three six am to susan scottetsenronenron cc kathy ringblometsenronenron subject re gouging that is by far the best line of the day unconscionability may be the thing im remembering but i think there is some more specific law related to market dislocationsie the hurricane example its sort of a twist on market power lawie if the fates hand you short term market power you better not use it df susan scott one one two one two zero zero zero one zero zero eight am to drew fossumetsenronenron cc kathy ringblometsenronenron subject re gouging i know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because they are unconscionable there are several examples in consumer law and employment law in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other is a west palm beach voter however if my memory serves me correctly none of them involve contracts between two sophisticated business entities such as tw and sempra or pge absent evidence of fraud courts uphold bargains struck at arms length kathy id be happy to take the oars on this but if youve already done some looking please let me know if youve found anything from drew fossum one one two zero two zero zero zero zero four four four pm to susan scottetsenronenron kathy ringblometsenronenron cc subject gouging stuck on the phone so i thought id email you stan has asked mike moran if tw has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under anti gouging statutes or common law you know the laws that say you cant charge one zero zero per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or five zero for a bucket of water during a drought i think we need to research two things one are there any such laws applicable to our business cal state law would probably be the best place to start two could the politicalregulatory fight in cal about power and gas prices ever expand all the way to our transport pricing ie if the cpuc whacks the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power its not a big leap for the cpuc or ferc or even us congress to whack gas sellers for jacking prices up to one four mmbtu as happened on friday if that happens its just another small jump to whack us for charging one for transport or so the logic goes id like to hear preliminary views by eight three zero monday am so i can talk to mike before stans staff meeting no written memo necessary based on that prelim research we can decide what else need s to be done thanks df,04:14:00,No

marketers cannot sell above cap and generators must be subject to cost filings if they do and the result is black outs alan tuesday july zero three two zero zero one copyright las vegas reviewjournal power shortages lv valley endures blackouts utility officials expect supplies to stay tight as hot weather continues this week by john g edwards reviewjournal the first rolling blackouts in southern nevada history hit the las vegas valley on monday with a speed that surprised even nevada power co the utility company declared a red alert and initiated rolling blackouts that left an estimated one zero zero zero zero customers without power it had reported seven zero zero zero zero customers were affected but later revised the number of customers who lost electricity the blackouts started at four one zero pm and ended at four five five pm the utility said nevada power attributed the power shortages to several factors unusually high temperatures for this time of year three generation unit outages the areas rapid growth power shortages in california and possibly the wholesale power price caps that federal regulators imposed last month what killed us was the temperature was unbelievable said paul heagan vice president of sierra pacific resources the holding company for nevada power the las vegas temperature soared to a nearrecord one one four degrees as for the rest of the week power supply is going to be tight heagan said the prospects this week are kind of tough to call the company logged record demand for power four four two one megawatts at five zero five pm monday the previous alltime high was four three two five megawatts on aug one a megawatt is roughly the amount of power needed to supply seven five zero houses by contrast on july two last year the utility hit three three zero zero megawatts when the temperature was one zero seven degrees heagan said the company targeted nonemergency areas for mondays rolling blackouts which affected mostly residential customers nevada power spokesmen declined to identify the affected areas even after the emergency was over witnesses said power went out in one area of the northwest and one area of the east valley electricity customers in the affected areas said the blackouts lasted between two zero and four five minutes several traffic signals went out including those at the intersections of buffalo drive and lake mead boulevard tenaya way and lake mead and boulder highway at us highway nine five las vegas police department officials reported few traffic problems because of the blackouts for the most part people reported few problems we only had a few customers and we couldnt do western union transactions without a computer but with the other customers we just winged it said michelle hitt a customer service representative at mail boxes etc seven five zero zero w lake mead blvd hitt said power at his store was out about four five minutes across the street an assistant manager for the vons supermarket at seven five three zero w lake mead blvd said customers could not check out when the stores power turned off the roadhouse grill at lake mead boulevard and tenaya way was shut down for about two five minutes shortly after four pm restaurant manager kim tuerk said we had to evacuate the building because of health department and fire codes but it was no big deal he said heagan said nevada power will start its rolling blackouts in other areas of the valley if it needs to cut power again this week the utilitys policy calls for no notification to areas that will lose power unlike california where a minimum of two four hours notice is required nevada power fears that notification would be used by burglars to locate unoccupied houses during the emergency tim hay state consumer advocate said he thinks customers in affected areas should be notified of possible outages they need to provide notice to affected areas at least in general areas to help people prepare hay said elsewhere in the valley consumers and businesses continued operating normally during the emergency meadows mall general manager frank wheat said power was not affected at the shopping center we know rolling blackouts can occur he said we do have backup generators for emergency lighting during hours of darkness but not for all the stores spokespeople at university medical center and sunrise hospital also said they were not affected by mondays blackouts and have their own backup power supplies minta albietz vice president of maternalchild services at sunrise we have our own little power plant in the back we can generate our own power for three zero days longer as long as we have fuel the company said its power woes began friday when it internally declared a yellow alert and warned employees that it was running short of power heagan said on friday nevada power customers were pulling down four three zero zero megawatts the second or thirdhighest peak in the company history he said meanwhile one of nevada powers electrical generation units at the reid gardner site five zero miles north of las vegas has been down since friday because of a leaking boiler he said also southern california edison which operates the mohave generating station at laughlin for several utilities notified the company friday that two of nevada powers units were down nevada power said it was able to obtain additional power on the spot market and avoid blackouts last week and did not need to seek any power use curtailment by major users the yellow alert continued through the weekend a period when electric consumption usually declines because businesses are closed and many people are driving around the company made arrangements to buy another two five zero megawatts of electricity monday when most businesses reopened that got eaten up by early afternoon heagan said the utility said casinos reduced about five zero megawatts by switching to backup generators and starting conservation measures but several strip casino operators said they received no requests to conserve power or to turn on their backup generation units nevada power hasnt asked us to shed power load said debbie munch park place entertainment spokeswoman they asked us to cut our power usage a couple of times last summer and we did so if they do ask us well do what we can to help the community mandalay resort group and mgm mirage executives said they were not asked to cut their power use monday our facilities guys said nobodys asked us for anything and we havent done anything said fred lewis aladdin spokesman at first glance it appears the problem was handled very well said don soderberg chairman of the public utilities commission which regulates nevada power its always hard to predict when were going to have abnormal temperatures and power plants are going to go offline soderberg said the situation he added underlines the need to build more power plants mondays one one four degree high was one degree shy of the record for the date the heat follows the warmest may on record said joe nemeth a senior forecaster with the national weather service temperatures are expected to stay warm but tapering off as the week progresses and the risk for thunderstorms increases meteorologists reported highs will stay in the tripledigit range but drop to one one zero degrees today one zero five on

 Defending Davis/Lynch",please see the following important stories it appears to be quickly slipping through davis fingers may be useful to regroup a bit in light of the following events in sum most importantly in todays chronicle its reported that davis staff met with key democrats yesterday and lowered the boom dwr purchases likely to be about two five billion and rates may have to go up by one zero zero see attached story apparently one of the big reasons that eight x got held up yesterday is because davis own staff went to d leadership and said dont move eight x a bill that davis was said to support because the one zero billion cap on bonds wont work they need much more it appears that rate increases will now become part of the mix whether davis likes it or not the staff alleged that they were conveying the information before davis had been informed of the bombshell davis was criticized for being at yet another fundraiser yesterday while the situation significantly deteroriated in sacramento see attached story meanwhile pge has suedor may be about to suethe state saying they wont pay the qfs according to davis plan which the puc is supposed to implement on tuesday see attached pge press release finally mike kahn has issued an opinion piece in yesterdays chronicle in which he attempts to lump together into one pile republicans market proponents price gougers and texans and defending davis and lynch davis measured plan to fight the darkness michael kahn friday march two three two zero zero one two zero zero one san francisco chronicle url httpwwwsfgatecomcgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchivetwo zero zero one zero three two three e done zero three seven seven eight dtl comments on gov gray davis energy programs by apologists for former gov pete wilson bring to mind robert kennedys admonition that it is better to light a candle than curse the darkness lets examine the darkness created by wilsons energy deregulation scheme the one nine nine six law he signed could not have been more wrong headed why did it hand energy price control over to the federal energy regulatory commission why did it free wholesale prices while capping the price utilities could charge customers why did the former state public utilities commission force utilities to sell off their fossil fuel power plants leaving them vulnerable to predatory pricing by outofstate merchant generators why did the wilsonera puc bar utilities from entering into contracts to ensure a longterm supply of cheap electricity most pointedly why did california enter into deregulation without enough available generation to ensure a fair market based on balanced supply and demand these are tough questions it is not hard to understand why former proponents of the one nine nine six deregulation scheme would rather not answer them preferring to bemoan the darkness and curse davis actions the wilson apologists jeer at plans for the state to purchase the power grid though they surely know the value of a wellmaintained fully functioning electric transmission network bottlenecks in the grid impede the sharing of power between northern and southern california this was a main reason northern california experienced rolling blackouts in january while southern california had plenty of power the states purchase of the grid will infuse new cash into the utilities pulling them back from the brink of bankruptcy while giving the state a tangible and valuable asset in exchange and ownership of the grid will allow the state to modernize it removing bottlenecks and upgrading technology something the utilities have long failed at doing the apologists ignore the states strong record on energy conservation and davis actions to enhance these efforts california now has the nations secondbest energy conservation record the governor has budgeted four zero four million in new conservation measures and added an executive order offering two zero percent rebates to those who reduce their consumption two zero percent over last year these measures will reduce commercial lighting encourage residential and industrial efficiency and make state and commercial buildings more energy efficient the apologists disregard the fact that the governor has also reversed a trend that had seen power plant construction in california drop to insignificance in the eight zero s and nine zero s since april one nine nine nine the california energy commission has licensed nine major new power plants six are under construction this is part of a streamlined fasttrack plant licensing process that aims to put an additional two zero zero zero zero megawatts on line by the summer of two zero zero four a nearly five zero percent increase in generation and the apologists refuse to recognize that california is building the right sort of power plants efficient clean and environmentally friendly with a strong bent toward renewable power sources in fact while some would go texas route and build plants that meet only the bare minimum of environmental requirements california is continuing the effort that has made it the nations leader in the use of clean renewable power sources instead the apologists engage in name calling such as the charge leveled by former wilson communications director dan schnur on this page that loretta lynch the davis appointee as puc chair is inexperienced and has failed to deal effectively with the energy emergency forget for a moment that of the two two people who have served as puc commissioners since one nine eight zero only six had any energy expertise before their appointments forget for a moment that one of the principal architects of deregulation was daniel fessler the uc davis contract law professor with no special expertise in energy issues whom gov wilson appointed as puc president just consider this it was the puc under lynch that freed the utilities to buy electricity on cheaper forward contracts outside the power exchange this corrected a huge wilsonera puc blunder that put utilities in an energy price straitjacket the lynchled puc also prohibited utilities from selling additional power plants and it began the successful effort to make californias iso the independent system operator that runs the states power grid independent of the industryconnected officials who controlled it meanwhile what sort of grand solutions have the apologists presented drill for oil in the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska build nuclear plants on closed military bases and encourage the construction of dirty texas style power plants in california drilling in the arctic will not produce a watt of new power for california californians have long said they do not want the risks presented by new nuclear plants and lax texas pollution rules prompted the dallas morning news to charge in a dec one seven editorial that texans are choking on the exhaust from power plants most disingenuously the apologists would let the market work claiming that unfettered market forces will soon bring fair and balanced prices but the market doesnt work now as the federal energy regulatory commission has repeatedly admitted most recently with its finding that generators overcharged the state in january unfortunately for the most part the same commission had refused to clamp down on skyhigh prices charged by generating companies look at new yorks deregulated market where there are no caps on retail electric prices market forces have done consumers there little good new yorkers pay the highest prices for electricity in the country and the new york times has reported that rates paid by consumers have increased a whopping four zero percent just since one nine nine nine those who would allow the market to work let the darkness reign know well that if the market works to produce new yorkstyle rate increases in california the consequences to the public would be dire compare this to gov davis wellstructured plan for effective energy conservation and stabilization of the states electricity market and his expedited program to bring clean efficient new power plants on line quickly robert kennedy would understand

administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that the state may have to spend twice as much as expected on electricity purchases over the next two years requiring rate increases of as much as one zero zero percent the stunning admission by the davis administration contradicts his repeated promises that his plan to ease californias energy woes could be done without a rate increase california will probably need to issue two three billion in bonds for electricity buys more than double the amount davis said would be needed by the state to keep electricity flowing until californias cashpoor utilities can get back on their feet administration officials told lawmakers to stop action on a bill that would have capped the states energy purchases at one zero billion but a davis spokesman said the numbers were far from firm there are a lot of scenarios being run and until we complete the negotiations this can be added up any way you want said steve maviglio press secretary to davis those numbers are not based on any reality right now he said there are too many things up in the air assembly democrats told a different story they said tim gage director of davis department of finance cabinet secretary susan kennedy and john stevens davis top energy aide met with assembly democratic leaders and dropped the bombshell and they did so just as those same leaders were trying to convince fellow lawmakers how important the bill was to the davis administration they also said that davis who was in the palm springs area for most of the day and briefly attended a fundraiser at a golf club was unaware of the figures purchases in billions the three top aides said that electricity purchases for this year by the state would be one six billion not the one zero billion initially predicted an additional seven billion in state power purchases would be needed next year they said the state has been buying power at a clip of four five million a day since jan one seven because the troubled utilities could no longer afford to make the purchases from the start of the energy crisis the state has planned to repay its power purchases through bond sales the bonds would be paid off by a portion of the amount ratepayers are charged on their monthly bills davis has so far insisted that enough money could be found to cover the one zero billion without raising rates but his aides said if the size of the bonds ballooned to two three billion a hefty rate increase would be necessary increase upon increase the public utilities commission is already planning to make permanent a temporary nine percent increase an additional automatic one zero percent is scheduled for no later than march two zero zero two but the aides said on top of that an additional six zero percent to eight zero percent increase would be required to cover the debt service for some time i have believed a fundamental part of solving this problem is admitting there needs to be a rate increase and the numbers that have been shared today make that inevitable and we should start dealing with the reality as soon as possible said assemblyman fred keeley dboulder creek santa cruz county one consumer advocate said the revelation means the utilities are closer to bankruptcy because the state and ratepayers wont have the cash to bail them out and it could mean political trouble for davis unless the governor issues an ultimatum to lower the prices everybodys bill will double and he will not be able to run for reelection in two zero zero two said harvey rosenfield head of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights pge threatens suit the news came as pacific gas and electric co threatened to take the state to court over davis plan to force the company to pay back certain creditors davis proposal would require the utilities to pay alternative power generators for all the power that they supply something pge said it cannot afford to do several of the generators shut down earlier this week as rolling blackouts spread across the state the bill stalled yesterday in the assembly as republicans objected lawmakers will resume debate monday earlier in the week davis announced that action would be taken by the legislature and the public utilities commission that would guarantee payment to the alternative energy providers he also said the state which has spent three seven billion to purchase power should be paid back first without that promise several of the small biomass solar and wind producing plants called qualified facilities said they would have taken southern california edison co into bankruptcy court the alternative generators provide enough electricity to power roughly six million homes pge said it cannot afford to pay the alternative producers and reimburse the state for the billions it has spent purchasing power these actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates further exacerbating an already precarious financial situation gordon smith pges president and chief executive officer said in a statement differing views on costs according to pges numbers the company collects four zero zero million a month in rates it says the average price to pay all the generation sources exceeds one four billion a month but consumer advocate nettie hoge said the utilities are exaggerating their own costs in order to try to keep as much money as possible its just absurd said hoge the head of the utility reform network they have a temper tantrum every time something doesnt go their way the bill pge objected to is necessary to allow the puc to order utilities to pay small power generators who agree to sign lowerpriced contracts to provide energy the proposal offers generators a choice of agreeing to a fiveyear contract at seven nine per megawatt or a one zero year deal at six nine per megawatt davis said the going rate now is about one five zero a megawatt the puc wants to act as early as tuesday to bring some financial relief to the generators who have been paid pennies on the dollar assembly republicans objected to the bill in part because it would allow the puc to change the formula for setting the price paid alternative producers so that it no longer considered the price of natural gas cogenerators some of the largest of which are operated by oil refineries say without the price of natural gas as a consideration it would cost them more to produce energy than what they would be paid for it email lynda gledhill at lgledhillsfchroniclecom two

dauner is a member davis top political adviser said the governor didnt play golf just stopped by a luncheon before the round began so he could return to sacramento but during davis absence a bill he backed critical to bailing out small power generators languished in the assembly on thursday lawmakers canceled next weeks longplanned annual trip to washington dc to focus on energy issues there is not a lot of electricity to be found on the golf course said harvey rosenfield of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights a chief critic of davis and the states utilities he ought to be in sacramento to try and solve the crisis and not prospecting for contributions in the grass in palm springs the democratic governor has been frequently criticized for the time he spends raising money for his campaign fund money that comes from wellheeled interests with dozens of issues pending before his administration since becoming governor davis amassed two five million by the end of two zero zero zero averaging more than one million a month in contributions often from fund raisers directed at specific industries garry south davis political adviser said davis was in palm springs to dedicate a university of california building and dropped by a lunch preceding the golf south said the fundraiser was a diverse group of people that paid varying amounts of money lawmakers canceled their yearly visit to federal officials on issues important to the golden state because they didnt want to give the impression that there was somewhere else more important than california said state sen don perata doakland raising money at a tony golf resort during the crisis simply looks bad perata said we have to be really careful because the publics patience and their confidence in what were asking them to do depends on how they see us reacting to the problem he said this will be negatively interpreted other lawmakers said the governors toplevel staff was working on the problem but acknowledged the golfing fundraiser looked bad its not the best symbolic message but i feel we have to give him the benefit of the doubt said assemblywoman carole migden dsan francisco davis did appear briefly yesterday on nationally broadcast cnbc to talk about the energy crisis and blast power generators for allegedly overcharging the state he appeared live from palm springs the california healthcare association represents nearly five zero zero hospitals and boasts on its web site that it influences public policy development through both legislative and regulatory advocacy efforts last month the group introduced a legislative package to expand nursing education and streamline college requirements for nurses one of the bills calls for spending one two zero million a year on nursing classes the group also is lobbying the new department of managed health care which is staffed by davis appointees to speed up payment of one billion in late bills owed to hospitals davis signed a bill last year that gave the hmo czar the power to sanction health care plans for failing to pay dauners clients the hospitals on time in his first six months in office davis attended a fundraising dinner at dauners house that brought in an estimated one zero zero zero zero zero it was part of a spree that netted the governor a recordbreaking six one million in half a year at the time dauner told the los angeles times we dont talk policy at those kinds of things or legislation this was really more of a social event he talked about his goals and probably spent more time discussing education than anything else dauner could not be reached for comment yesterday email the reporters at glucassfchroniclecom and bsalladaysfchroniclecom two zero zero one san francisco chronicle pagea one three for

gas and electric company today announced that it will be forced to challenge actions now being contemplated by the state of california to impose new demands on its frozen rate structure the proposed actions will destabilize its current situation with creditors and put the entire possibility of reaching a balanced solution to californias energy crisis at risk this week the state has made clear its intention to use pacific gas and electric companys existing rate structure to begin fully paying qualifying facilities qfs in advance for future power purchases starting april one and to reimburse the department of water resources dwr in advance of any other generating source including utilityretained generation bilateral contracts qfs or the independent system operator iso these actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates further exacerbating an already precarious financial situation said gordon r smith president and chief executive officer of pacific gas and electric company the numbers just dont work currently under frozen rates pacific gas and electric company has been collecting approximately four zero zero million per month for the purchase of electric power this revenue has been used in payments to power suppliers including power purchases from irrigation districts and bilaterals to cover costs of operating our retained generation and is insufficient to cover payments to the iso and qfs the average combined energy bill from all of these sources exceeds one four billion a month and may go even higher in the coming months moreover the utilitys financial condition has been further jeopardized by the failure of the dwr to acknowledge responsibility for the full net open position ie the power that must be purchased on the spot market this dispute over the net open position is threatening to accrue additional liabilities for pacific gas and electric company we continue to work with state officials to develop a constructive comprehensive solution that assures that california has a reliable and fairly priced supply of power nevertheless we have a duty to our suppliers lenders and shareholders to protect the assets of the utility and we must challenge any action by the state to force us to pay out more than is collected in rates mr smith concluded,04:57:00,No

tribe october one four two zero zero one in my tribe by ethan watters it may be true that never marrieds are saving themselves for something better they may also be saving the institution of marriage while theyre at it you may be like me between the ages of two five and three nine single a collegeeducated city dweller if so you may have also had the unpleasant experience of discovering that you have been identified by the us census bureau no less as one of the fastestgrowing groups in america the never marrieds in less than three zero years the number of nevermarrieds has more than doubled apparently pushing back the median age of marriage to the oldest it has been in our countrys history about two five years for women and two seven for men as if the connotation of never married werent negative enough the vilification of our group has been swift and shrill these statistics prove a titanic loss of family values according to the washington times an article in time magazine asked whether picky women were denying themselves and society the benefits of marriage and in the process kicking off an outbreak of sex and the city promiscuity in a study on marriage conducted at rutgers university researchers say the social glue of the family is at stake adding ominously that crime rates are highly correlated with a large percentage of unmarried young males although i never planned it i can tell you how i became a nevermarried thirteen years ago i moved to san francisco for what i assumed was a brief transition period between college and marriage the problem was i wasnt just looking for an appropriate spouse to use the language of the rutgers researchers i was soulmate searching like nine four percent of nevermarrieds from two zero to two nine i too agree with the statement when you marry you want your spouse to be your soul mate first and foremost this berromantic view is something new in a one nine six five survey fully three out of four college women said theyd marry a man they didnt love if he fit their criteria in every other way i discovered along with my friends that finding that soul mate wasnt easy girlfriends came and went as did jobs and apartments the constant in my life by default not by plan became a loose group of friends after a few years that groups membership and routines began to solidify we met weekly for dinner at a neighborhood restaurant we traveled together moved one anothers furniture painted one anothers apartments cheered one another on at sporting events and openmike nights one day i discovered that the transition period i thought i was living wasnt a transition period at all something real and important had grown there i belonged to an urban tribe i use the word tribe quite literally here this is a tight group with unspoken roles and hierarchies whose members think of each other as us and the rest of the world as them this bond is clearest in times of trouble after earthquakes or the recent terrorist strikes my instinct to huddle with and protect my group is no different from what id feel for my family once i identified this in my own life i began to see tribes everywhere i looked a house of exsorority women in philadelphia a team of ultimatefrisbee players in boston and groups of musicians in austin tex cities ive come to believe arent emotional wastelands where fragile individuals with arrested development mope around selfindulgently searching for true love there are rich landscapes filled with urban tribes so what does it mean that weve quietly added the tribe years as a developmental stage to adulthood because our friends in the tribe hold us responsible for our actions i doubt it will mean a wild swing toward promiscuity or crime tribal behavior does not prove a loss of family values it is a fresh expression of them it is true though that marriage and the tribe are at odds as many exgirlfriends will ruefully tell you loyalty to the tribe can wreak havoc on romantic relationships not surprisingly marriage usually signals the beginning of the end of tribal membership from inside the group marriage can seem like a risky gambit when members of our tribe choose to get married the rest of us talk about them with grave concern as if theyve joined a religion that requires them to live in a guarded compound but we also know that the urban tribe cant exist forever those of us who have entered our midthree zero s find ourselves feeling vaguely as if were living in the latter episodes of seinfeld or friends as if the plot lines of our lives have begun to wear thin so although tribe membership may delay marriage that is where most of us are still heading and it turns out there may be some good news when we get there divorce rates have leveled off tim heaton a sociologist at brigham young university says he believes he knows why in a paper to be published next year he argues that it is because people are getting married later could it be that we who have been biding our time in happy tribes are now actually grown up enough to understand what we need in a mate what a fantastic twist we never marrieds may end up revitalizing the very institution weve supposedly been undermining and theres another dynamic worth considering those of us who find it so hard to leave our tribes will not choose marriage blithely as if it is the inevitable next step in our lives the way middleclass highschool kids choose college when we go to the altar we will be sacrificing something precious in that sacrifice we may begin to learn to treat our marriages with the reverence they need to survive ethan watters is a writer living in san francisco httpwwwnytimescomtwo zero zero one one zero one four magazineone four wwlnhtmlexone zero zero

dynegy know what its getting into power points does dynegy know what its getting into by mark golden a dow jones newswires column new york dow jonesif i were an executive with dynegy inc dyn i would want to know who was buying up my stock thursday and friday encouraging me that enron is a steal at nine five zero a share after all the markets initial reaction to the dynegyenron corp ene talks was negative dynegys share price fell nine to three three on the wednesday the day that dynegy was negotiating a possible acquisition of enron were disclosed by cnbc but dynegys stock rebounded sharply thursday to recover that loss and then some and its up another three to near four zero friday is this a case of average investors approving dynegys steal of formerly formidable enron or were wall street banks holding a lot of enron debt trying to encourage dynegy to do a deal about seven five of the one two million dynegy shares bought thursday were purchased in a few hundred large blocks some usually talkative wall street bank sources refuse to say a word about enron or dynegy even off the record wall street may be biting its collective lip in the hopes that dynegy signs the contracts to buy enron and brings in a critical injection of cash that cash would come from chevrontexaco corp cvx which owns about a quarter of dynegy according to the wall street journal the terms of the deal call for chevrontexaco to inject one five billion immediately and another one billion into the combined companies if the deal goes through wall street holds billions in enron debt which dynegy is fully aware of but dynegy might be getting more than its bargaining for particularly regarding enrons numerous obligations to deliver its own shares in the future at minimum values sec probe complicates deals based on stock any company that acquires enron may have to make good on those commitments to issue stock pegged to values much higher than nine five zero a share or perhaps to make up the difference in cash in a publicly disclosed example an enron offbalancesheet financial affiliate whitewing associates owns two five zero zero zero zero shares of enron convertible preferred stock which are good upon conversion in january two zero zero three for five zero million shares of enron common stock at a guaranteed minimum value of four eight five five a share enrons stock is currently trading below nine a share according to the terms of whitewings convertible preferred holding enron would have to deliver far more shares at current prices one zero eight zero for each of the two five zero zero zero zero convertibles but enron cant issue new stock now because its under investigation by the us securities and exchange commission so it would be obliged to come up with the four zero pershare difference in cash since enron owns five zero of whitewing it could tear up most of the convertibles but not all of them a rough estimate is that enron or dynegy would still owe the dozens of mutual funds that invested in whitewing around five zero zero million cash dynegy is surely familiar with that deal but highly leveraged enron has similar sharesettled arrangements floating around that havent been so fully disclosed the lesserknown deals are similarly troublesome due to the combination of enrons stockprice crash and its inability to issue lots of new stock to make up the difference another enronrelated partnership the marlin water trust ii is part of enrons disastrous venture into water companies through its azurix affiliate and the later refinancing of huge losses related to the water investments enron has marked down the value of its direct holdings in azurix but not the assets of marlin even though marlins primary asset is supposed to be its half of azurix prominent enron shortseller richard grubman of highfields capital management has asked enron why marlins assets are still valued at one billion when five zero of azurix would seem to be a worth a fraction of that amount enron has declined to answer grubmans question fully is wall street short fitch credit rating agency said this july that marlins debt is ultimately supported by an equity commitment from enron in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock neither the number of shares nor the guaranteed minimum value for those shares has been disclosed if enron cant deliver those shares it is obliged to make up the difference in cash fitch said in the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes enron is required to deliver additional shares fitch said if enron cannot or does not deliver on this obligation then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of enron representing a general unsecured claim in another partnership disclosed in enrons two zero zero zero annual report but not named enron invested the right to receive up to one eight million shares of outstanding enron common stock in march two zero zero three subject to certain conditions do those conditions include a share value much higher than nine five zero did enron prudently purchase puts on its own stock from wall street to cover some of its positions as part of that same deal enron paid one two three million to purchase unspecified options on two one seven million shares of its common stock because these deals are done through private placements of debt enron doesnt have to answer questions and it has declined to do so dynegy also refused to answer questions on the issue one wall street equity derivatives trading manager indicated that all the banks have found themselves unexpectedly short inthemoney puts on enron unexpectedly perhaps not just because enron stock has fallen so far but because the sec investigation prevents enron from issuing additional shares wall street has been sweating for weeks and millions dont make wall street sweat billions do and the concern has to do with liabilities beyond enrons fully disclosed traditional debt the banks have told enron they dont expect to get clobbered on a technicality that wouldnt have arisen without the sec investigation enron brought on itself a person at a bank involved in the talks said enron agreed in principle but the negotiations to make wall street whole were put on hold for the dynegy talks if dynegy buys enron it may be stepping into the middle of those arrangements letting wall street off the hook dynegy competitor el paso corp epg and chevrontexaco rival royal dutchshell rd reportedly took a look at acquiring enron

to be complete in september two zero zero zero i was assigned to the project in late june two zero zero zero and do not have any inspection shipping receipts or etc at this time i do have a qaqc inspector on this project to ensure enron and calme get a quality turbine for their money i am also working on an afe to cover the expenses of this work from july two zero zero zero until the turbine is turned over to a dedicated project site this cost will include proper storage of the gtg and inspections so we do not have another debacle like the iuka ms frame six bs at the present i anticipate the cost to be from five zero zero zero zero to seven five zero zero zero till the end of this year any money left over will be carried over into the following year or rebated when the turbine is turned over to a dedicated project site ie calme will only need to cover what is actually spent the only deviation to the contract that i am aware of is the change order for the duel fuel option i believe that other changes are being negotiated but i am unaware of the content of those changes if any at this time to begin the summary the gas turbine is in the houston texas powerserve shop going through final assembly the turbine is expected to ship to the delivery point port of houston by mid to late september two zero zero zero the generator is a different story it was shipped from nasan south korea on eight jun zero zero it arrived in the port of houston on or about two three jul zero zero as the cargo ship was offloading its cargo the ship listed to one side the crew went to rebalast the ship however they did not close certain valves or something to that effect and flooded the cargo bay containing our generator when the mistake was realized one nine inches of seawater was in and around the generator the water touched the parallel rings but not the core of the generator talking with lynn dekrey westinghouse project manager he informed us that westinghouse engineering has declared the generator nonsalvageable lynn is currently gathering information so we can claim an insurable event occurred as well as trying to find us a generator as soon as possible lynn is also going to send an accident report so we may evaluate the damage as well we have not accepted delivery of the generator and turbine furthermore title has not been transferred to enron i have alerted dan shultz brian barto and dwight alexander of these events in short the westinghouse five zero one dfive a will not be available as a gtg set in september two zero zero zero options to repair the generator were discussed with lynn and it is estimated to take anywhere from six to twelve months and cost three five to five million dollars the next option is to take delivery of an erferd generator from germany in late july two zero zero one the last option which lynn is currently working is to supply a generator in sufficient time for a commercial operation date of june one two zero zero zero

and to the right that could be the theme of the eighth annual dain rauscher wessels energy conference this week in americas selfproclaimed oil capital between the whispers in the hallways and the bullish presentations from an overflowing barrel of oil gas and power companies you might think you were in the corridors of some silicon valley conference of yesteryear but no this is all about energy and energy is hot with oil hanging around three seven per barrel and natural gas solidly above five per million btu oil gas and power stocks have caught fire to illustrate take a look at the chart of the philadelphia stock exchange oil service sector index or osx up and to the right and a great deal of the price gain is rational as the price of the commodities increases profits follow that should mean positive earnings from a plethora of oil and gas companies while new securities and exchange commission regulations have stifled the more explicit now illicit preannouncements at conferences like this regulations cant cap all the enthusiasm from rising commodity prices for example kenneth lay chairman of energy powerhouse enron enenyse said at the conference he is very comfortable with analysts estimates hinting the numbers are conservative we should meet or exceed analysts expectations for the quarter and the year others followed suit bradley fischer president of cms energy oil and gas cmsnyse profiled here earlier said his company will post record production and record income this year because the fundamentals of the oil and gas business are as good as they have been in his career ive been in this business two eight years the first one zero were good and the last one eight have been difficult now im looking for the good times to roll and this from diana naylor senior vice president at independent power producer calpine cpnnyse when reacting to analysts estimates in the coming year we look to be making that number and look to increase that guidance on earnings shortly even the oil drillers and equipment companies are celebrating nabors industries nbramex owner of the largest landdrilling fleet thinks analysts are significantly underestimating its potential dain rauscher estimates nabors will earn eight three cents per share this year and one six five next year numbers chairman and ceo eugene isenberg called conservative he presented calculations suggesting the company could earn three two seven in the middle of the oil cycle and has the ability to earn six eight one in the coming years the probability of this happening is very high he said all because of three seven per barrel oil and five gas while there is little question that third and fourthquarter earnings should be strong there is growing concern that the oil and gas stock rally has been overdone not only have stocks tracked the rise in commodity prices but the oncebeleaguered sector has also seen earnings multiples expand significantly that is a warning sign to at least one analyst while the going is good the rapid price rise isnt sustainable oil stocks stocks will peak in the next several weeks and trade sideways probably for the rest of the year said jim wicklund head of energy research at dain rauscher adding that there may be added selling pressure as funds try to lock in gains before the end of the year stock price pressure will also be impacted by portfolio managers bonus structure and wicklund warned that what he sees as the inevitable moderation in oil prices will put pressure on the stocks into the new year right or wrong stock prices are slaves to commodity prices if wicklund is correct the next move could be down and to the left the peoples court one of the clever and unique features of the dain rauscher wessels energy conference is the annual investor poll this year nearly four zero zero investors responded to the onsite survey and while the results arent scientific they are likely instructive power to the people investors speak

further into next year however survey participants do not see the same pattern for natural gas with estimates for gas prices remaining well above four five zero through next year and what may at first

others you think would benefit thanks shannon could hear the footsteps behind her as she walked toward home the thought of being followed made her heart beat faster youre being silly she told herself no one is following you to be safe she began to walk faster but the footsteps kept up with her pace she was afraid to look back and she was glad she was almost home shannon said a quick prayer god please get me home safe she saw the porch light burning and ran the rest of the way to her house once inside she leaned against the door for a moment relieved to be in the safety of her home she glanced out the window to see if anyone was there the sidewalk was empty after tossing her books on the sofa she decided to grab a snack and get online she logged on under her screen name byangeltwo one three she checked her buddy list and saw gotoone two three was on she sent him an instant message byangeltwo one three hi im glad you are on i thought someone was following me home today it was really weird gotoone two three lol you watch too much tv why would someone be following you dont you live in a safe neighborhood byangeltwo one three of course i do lol i guess it was my imagination cuz i didnt see anybody when i looked out gotoone two three unless you gave your name out online you havent done that have you byangeltwo one three of course not im not stupid you know gotoone two three did you have a softball game after school today byangeltwo one three yes and we won gotoone two three thats great who did you play byangeltwo one three we played the hornets lol their uniforms are so gross they look like bees lol gotoone two three what is your team called byangeltwo one three we are the canton cats we have tiger paws on our uniforms they are really kewl gotoone two three did you pitch byangeltwo one three no i play second base i got to go my homework has to be done before my parents get home i dont want them mad at me bye gotoone two three catch you later bye meanwhile gotoone two three went to the member menu and began to search for her profile when it came up he highlighted it and printed it out he took out a pen and began to write down what he knew about angel so far her name shannon birthday jan three one nine eight five ageone three state where she lived north carolina hobbies softball chorus skating and going to the mall besides this information he knew she lived in canton because she had just told him he knew she stayed by herself until six three zero pm every afternoon until her parents came home from work he knew she played softball on thursday afternoons on the school team and the team was named the canton cats her favorite number seven was printed on her jersey he knew she was in the seventh grade at the canton junior high school she had told him all this in the conversations they had online he had enough information to find her now shannon didnt tell her parents about the incident on the way home from the ball park that day she didnt want them to make a scene and stop her from walking home from the softball games parents were always overreacting and hers were the worst it made her wish she was not an only child maybe if she had brothers and sisters her parents wouldnt be so overprotective by thursday shannon had forgotten about the footsteps following her her game was in full swing when suddenly she felt someone staring at her it was then that the memory came back she glanced up from her second base position to see a man watching her closely he was leaning against the fence behind first base and he smiled when she looked at him he didnt look scary and she quickly dismissed the fear she had felt after the game he sat on a bleacher while she talked to the coach she noticed his smile once again as she walked past him he nodded and she smiled back he noticed her name on the back of her shirt he knew he had found her quietly he walked a safe distance behind her it was only a few blocks to shannons home and once he saw where she lived he quickly returned to the park to get his car now he had to wait he decided to get a bite to eat until the time came to go to shannons house he drove to a fast food restaurant and sat there until time to make his move shannon was in her room later that evening when she heard voices in the living room shannon come here her father called he sounded upset and she couldnt imagine why she went into the room to see the man from the ballpark sitting on the sofa sit down her father began this man has just told us a most interesting story about you shannon moved cautiously to a chair across from the man how could he tell her parents anything she had never seen him before today do you know who i am shannon the man asked no shannon answered i am a police officer and your online friend gotoone two three shannon was stunned thats impossible goto is a kid my age hes one four and he lives in michigan the man smiled i know i told you all that but it wasnt true you see shannon there are people on line who pretend to be kids i was one of them but while others do it to find kids and hurt them i belong to a group of parents who do it to protect kids from predators i came here to find you to teach you how dangerous it is to give out too much information to people online you told me enough about yourself to make it easy for me to find you your name the school you went to the name of your ball team and the position you played the number and name on your jersey just made finding you a breeze shannon was stunned you mean you dont live in michigan he laughed no i live in raleigh it made you feel safe to think i was so far away didnt it she nodded i had a friend whose daughter was like you only she wasnt as lucky the guy found her and murdered her while she was home alone kids are taught not to tell anyone when they are alone yet they do it all the time online the wrong people trick you into giving out information a little here and there online before you know it you have told them enough for them to find you without even realizing you have done it i hope youve learned a lesson from this and wont do it again i wont shannon promised solemnly will you tell others about this so they will be safe too its a promise,07:23:00,No

aep entergy corp and southern company told by ferc to charge costbased p rices instead of marketbased prices for wholesale spot transactionstwo zero news item from reuters the us federal energy regulatory commission fer c voted three one last week to adopt new rules to measure market power as a con dition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade powe r in the wholesale market ferc commissioners said the new test would impro ve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the california market last winter when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight supplies ferc commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test base d on supply margin assessments which examines a companys importance in se rving peak electricity loads if youre big enough to control the market a t the time we look at it youll have mitigation put on you said ferc cha irman pat woodtwo zero analysis many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry are still reeling from fercs new ruling which may have slipped past some radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday weekend this is a mammoth ruling on fercs part however and it holds tre mendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lions share of their profits coming from wholesale transactions in addition state reg ulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrin king profits in their wholesale operations while ferc has presented this r uling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experience d in the california market the new limits on wholesale transactions can al so be seen as another example of the big stick that the commission is usi ng to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizat ions rto further the ruling is another striking indication that chairma n wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale m arkets while still attempting to support competition the objective represe nts a tall order and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prom pt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale tradingtwo zero put into a nutshell ferc has ruled that some companies can no longer charg e unregulated marketbased rates for spot market wholesale transactions i nstead companies identified as having market power and that arent part of an approved rto must charge costbased prices for power that isnt committ ed in a longterm contract and publicly disclose those costbased prices columbus ohiobased american electric power nyse aep atlantabased sou thern company nyse so and new orleansbased entergy corp nyse etr ha ve been singled out as case studies on which ferc will be immediately apply ing its new standards for wholesale transactions note that mirant corp a former subsidiary of southern company has also been identified as having to submit information to ferc in order to gauge its level of market power s eparate from its former parent the commission has essentially determined t hat these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the areas in which they operate under fercs new market power test a gener ator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electrici ty is pivotal during peak demand which enables the company to demand a p rice above competitive levels regional transmission constraints will also be considered now as a measurement of a companys market power this is a d ramatic departure from previous standards by which under one of fercs ma in criterions a company that supplied less than two zero percent of the power ne eded in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal l eveltwo zero there are some important exceptions to the ruling first ferc has not elim inated the utilities ability to charge marketbased rates in areas where t he grid and markets are controlled by a fercapproved rto this is signific ant as i will expand upon subsequently because it indicates that there ar e secondary objectives in fercs new ruling in addition the current rulin g only impacts shortterm sales transactions in which these three utilities are involved in other words longterm contracts that the three companies may have previously established or will establish in the future are not im pacted by the ruling however the three companies named in the ruling will have to post pricing information related to longterm contracts and ferc has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for longterm co ntracts may be necessary also note that the western market which already is under a price mitigation policy that ferc imposed in june was not inclu ded in the new rulingtwo zero the three utilities named in the ruling now have one five days to submit proposal s to ferc outlining a transition to charging costbased wholesale rates for all power not currently committed to a buyer specifically the utilities will have to post on their openaccess sametime information systems oasis the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour in a two four hour period moving forward the price that the utilities can charg e for noncommitted power on the spot market will be the difference between their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region that their power displaces the new costbased rates must be administered by an independent third partytwo zero the new pricing standards revert back to an older costbased technique kno wn as split the savings the methodology for this standard can get rather complicated but essentially under fercs new ruling the three companies i dentified will have to post their costbased incremental costs for spot po wer into the oasis system for viewing by potential purchases purchasers wh o want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not produci ng or buying the power on their own the final price for the transactions w ill be the split between the sellers incremental cost and the buyers decr emental bid for instance if southern company bids its incremental cost at two zero mwh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at three zero mwh the transact ion price would be two five mwh assuming a midnighttomidnight trading day se llers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous da y and buyers would submit their decremental bids by six pm what this potent ially creates is an information advantage for buyers who have six hours t o evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers some of t he drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows th e purchaser to game the system by having access to the sellers original in cremental bid and competing around the sellers pricetwo zero note also that in a separate development ferc simultaneously opened a broad investigation under section two zero six of the federal power act to apply the new marketbasedsales policy to all us sellers nationwide what this means i s that although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order it is expected that ferc will continue to take steps to constrain what it b elieves to be erratic wholesale markets reportedly some three zero companies are awaiting similar reviews by ferc to determine if the commission believes th ey exert market power the two zero six investigation reportedly also requires power providers with marketbased sales authority to amend their tariffs within six zero days to provide ferc with openended authority to order refunds if the c ommission determines that market manipulation has occurredtwo zero i made a previous reference to the big stick that ferc is carrying relate d to participation in rtos remember that a few months ago chairman wood h ad threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an rto the benefits of charging marketbased wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger appli cations advantages that the chairman equated with the new world of the d eregulated energy market with this in mind note that only southern compan y entergy and aep are included in the present ruling although it may be s ubsequently expanded southern company and entergy in particular have exhi bited some resistance in following fercs consolidation mandate regarding n ational rtos so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three uti lities have been singled out this must be particularly painful for souther n company which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading an d previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets ov er the next five yearstwo zero interestingly commissioner linda key breathitt represented the single diss enting vote in the ruling breathitts concern was that the ruling had been pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evalu ate the impact on wholesale markets this issue will undoubtedly be contest ed and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to have been caught offguard aep entergy and southern company all issued st atements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t he ruling would impact them and that they were reserving the right for pos sible litigationtwo zero moreover to summarize the commissions rulemaking i think there are a han dful of important points that should be considered first the ruling illus trates the steps that ferc is taking to revoke marketprice authority that was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that pat wood assumed his post as chairman second ferc is implementing costbased prices on the spot market only and in only very defined circumstances however this co uld be an indication that the commission may extend costbased pricing to o ther wholesale transactions including longterm contracts at a later time third the split the savings costbased formula could become fraught wi th its own problems its requirements are rather complex and it offers the potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov er power sellers which will now be required to post incremental costs in t he bidding process finally one of the inherent drivers of fercs new ruli ng is its desire to have large utilities join the rtos that the commission has approved it is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact s aep entergy and southern company utilities that have not only been deem ed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a lso not yet joined an approved rto however even though only three compani es are immediately impacted by this ruling it should not be overlooked tha t the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi ll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain areas thus overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s ubstantially change the

mills by zahida hafeez of dow jones newswires chicago dow jonesas power prices skyrocket in the pacific northwest and forest products markets soften some pulp and paper producers could consider turning into power vendors taking downtime and instead reselling energy into the open market at least in theory many analysts believe that switching to selling power can be a more profitable enterprise for pulp and paper mills as it has been for some aluminum mills nationwide pulp and paper makers generate roughly five five of their energy while four five is purchased from outside sources in some cases through fixed pricing arrangements and some even generate power enough to compete with public utilities for rank the worlds largest newsprint maker abitibiconsolidated inc aby which ranks as the thirdlargest generator of power in the canadian northwest region selfgenerates three five of its energy needs of course not all companies could switch firstly not all cogenerate a significant amount of their energy needs and those that do need to keep running their operations sidebyside secondly the fixedrate contracts with public utilities bar customers from reselling power and lastly energy sale is strictly regulated in many parts of the us and canada and hence not very profitable mills which could profit from selling energy are those with fixed pricing arrangements for natural gas and electricity they could take downtime while reselling their energy at a higher price alternatively they could adjust operations to run machines during nonpeak hours while selling electricity during the peak hours meanwhile mills that have onsite hydroelectric power generators such as abitibi and pacifica papers inc tppp can easily sell surplus energy or even close down operations and sell energy instead with wholesale power prices for dayahead delivery hovering in the midfour zero zero s a megawatt hour in the pacific northwest region and hitting three zero zero zero a megawatt hour just two weeks ago on speculation that extremely cold weather would boost demand to where it would exhaust supply it might not be a bad plan to consider shutting down newsprint makers could double profits rob duncan analyst with research capital corp in toronto estimates that those paper companies which are now making a profit of one five zero to two zero zero per ton of newsprint for instance could double their profits they could be making a profit of three zero zero a ton of newsprint capacity closed if they were to sell electricity even at a rate of two five zero a megawatt hour nevertheless duncan added my feeling is that companies havent thought this through yet indeed most companies are in the process of evaluating whether or not energy selling would suit their longterm goals and allow them to meet customer needs including abitibi bowater inc bow weyerhaeuser co wy and domtar inc dtc most producers interviewed by the dow jones newswires declined to say how much power they generated were examining all of our alternatives at this point and first and foremost whether it makes sense to make paper at current energy rates or more sense to shut down said abitibis spokesman john chimienti adding but at this point there arent imminent closures the alternatives the company is considering now extend to deals with the respective public utilities to participate in some kind of loadshedding plan or shutting down in the winter months for better rates in the future chimienti said abitibi has resold some of its purchased energy in the past but never its hydroelectric power with most of its mills which are selfsufficient being located in regulated power markets officials said during this summers energy price spike abitibi closed for a day or two a mill in augusta georgia and resold its contracted power according to michael innes vice president of energy and environment at abitibi reselling power seemed like a more profitable prospect at the mill which has the capability to produce four four zero zero zero zero tons of newsprint annually innes said as to whether the company could do it again innes said weve never done it in the winter but that doesnt mean we cant ever do it paul ehinger an independent analyst based in medford ore said several plywood plants in the northwest region which purchase natural gas at previously fixed lower rates have closed down and are reselling natural gas at a higher price than they paid us natural gas prices on the benchmark new york mercantile exchange have soared steadily since midfebruary from around three zero zero per million british thermal units to an alltime high near one zero this month four times one nine nine nine levels the markets are poor and if you can make more money by shutting down operations and reselling natural gas bought at a firm price you should do it ehinger said however the practice remains largely restricted we havent seriously considered this conceptbut it would depend on whether the cost of power keeps rising said bob boschee mill manager for smurfitstone container corps sscc mill in missoula mont which is currently running at only five zero operating rate on electricity bought at fixed rates from enron corp ene everything becomes a consideration if power sells for three zero zero zero a megawatt hour as it did a week or two ago im sure

familiar with the concept of automation automated factories automated order fulfillment from online enterprises and automated tape libraries on the computer room floor but of the many facets of automation with which we have daily contact i suggest that at least as far as it is concerned the best automation is the automation that you never see i am of course referring to software automation what is software automation its the builtin intelligence that some vendors are able to put into their more sophisticated products for example it may be the knowledge of experienced database administrators dba that when made a part of a backup system enables junior dbas to push a single button and execute complex tasks such software might for example have a high level of understanding of the applications being protected high enough in fact that they can take advantage of the backup or restore capabilities that already exist within the applications own software a nice example of this useful feature can be found in bmcs sqlbacktrack product httpwwwbmccom such application specific intelligence when embedded within storage resource management srm software often enables increased efficiency of operation by putting applicationspecific knowledge in the hands of newlyminted dbas alternatively automation could be the softwares capability to replace repetitive tasks that require a good deal of human interaction with monitoring and managing a nice example of this is certainly the ability of some business continuity software to recover automatically from interrupted backups storage resource manager from tivoli httpwwwtivolicom comes to mind here reconfiguring network topologies and then tuning your management software to deal with the new environment is always both time and laborintensive a growing trend however finds new software releases with a builtin capability to analyze and understand the network topology whenever a change is made to it thus autodiscovery of network and storage assets in datacores httpwwwdatacorecom virtualization software enables that companys product to dynamically manage volumes on an asneeded basis these are three very good examples of the benefit that software automation can deliver fortunately an increasing number of other companies are also delivering of this promise often such capabilities will prove to be a very useful differentiator when it comes to choosing a product for use in your own shop when it comes to situations that are repetitive or extremely complex or that may require fasterthanhuman interactions look for a high degree of automation in the tools you choose for your it staff automated management can go a long way to improving your teams capability to react quickly and with intelligence to some of their most challenging tasks the bottom line the softwares understanding of the installed application and hardware base plus its ability to exploit the capabilities of the existing infrastructure is the key _______________________________________________________________ to contact mike karp mike karp is senior analyst with enterprise management associates httpwwwenterprisemanagementcom in boulder

measures passed with only one dissenting vote on abx six asm john campbell although abx five passed in its current form possible amendments to be taken in the senate would include increasing the number of governing board members increasing the length of the terms and addressing the issue of governor appointees on the eob confirming governor appointees on the iso an d px testifying in support of the measure were the consumers union eob calpirg turn ora and the california utilities employees the iso testified in opposition based on a past ferc letter which opposes an appointed board the abx six debate was over the conflict in the public utilities code regarding utility asset retention sections eight five one and three seven seven the debate however was not limited to this one point asm leonard started the ball rolling when he noted a problem when some generation in the state is regulated the utility generation and some isnzero one t the new generators this issue was picked up by asms steinberg jackson oropeza and diaz wh o suggested that there may need to be legislation to regulate all the generation in the state asm wright did a good job pointing out that in doing so the state would have to offer generator owners something in retur n the state isnzero one t able to afford when loretta lynch spoke in support of the bill she began with the stage three alert noting there was one five zero zero zero megawatts offline today and generators were refusing to allow state inspectors into their plants although the only company she named was aes she made every committee member believe it was everyone in response to a question about longterm contracts she said that since august this cpuc has allowed it and the utilities are the ones who refuse to enter into contracts pete conaty from labor repeated his statement that when the new generators purchased these plants they significantly reduced the labor force ran the plants harder than when the utilities ran them and that

mark palmercorpenronenron karen dennecorpenronenron cc subject meeting with governor davis need for additional commentssuggestions we met with gov davis on thursday evening in la in attendance were ken lay the governor the governors staff director kari dohn and myself the gov spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas he would like some additional thoughts from us by tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following monday attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials jeff dasovich and i prepared below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals the governors ideas as well as my overview of the situation based on the governors comments overview we made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees his staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea he talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers including utilityowned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a costplus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at three zero zero zero mw he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by zero two and provide some political cover our proposals i have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided he seemed interested in one the buy down of significant demand two the state setting a goal of xzero zero zero mw of new generation by a date certain three getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and four setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities he was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding ldc gas purchases as already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities his ideas the gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming some of these ideas would require legislative action state may build or make buildtransfer arrangements a couple of generation plants the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases this was a frequently recurring theme utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a costplus basis to consumers municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in california state universities including uccsu and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation expand instate gas production take state lands gas royalties in kind negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies empower an existing state agency to approvecoordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how nordpool worksjeff someone in schroeders group should be able to help out here wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new instate generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators securitize uncollected power purchase costs to dos jeff again id like to prevail on you to assemble the groups thoughts and get them to kari he wants to see five year fixed power prices for peak offpeak and baseload not just the five one year strips he wants comments on his proposals by tuesday he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues thanks to everyone for their help we made some progress today,05:26:00,"Yes

 Systems",christi l nicolayect one one one zero two zero zero zero zero three two two pm to ginger dernehlnaenronenron cc subject ferc staff investigations on midwest and southeast bulk power systems please forward this to ricks group thanks please note that these ferc staff reports contain some potentially helpful information that can be used at the state puc level including information on the increase in generation in the midwest that market participants attribute to lack of price caps following the summer one nine nine eight price spikes better preparation for summer two zero zero zero through the use of forward contracts and transmission problems that may have resulted in keeping cheaper power from particular markets on one one one zero zero ferc staff issued reports on its investigation of bulk power markets in the eastern interconnection these reports were the result of a commission order earlier this summer enrons federal regulatory staff christi charles yeung and sarah novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and joe hartsoe and donna fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of staff scott miller who recently joined ferc from pge gen while the commission is under no obligation to take any of staffs recommendations the commission typically looks to staff for guidance on transmission and market issues importantly staff concludes that the commission should consider these options for the southeast and midwest all of which enron has been asking ferc to implement for several years reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that vius have to favor their native load through the calculation of atc and handling of interconnection requests while the staff hotline is used productively the commission can direct staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints the commission could require tps to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the tennessee power order that utilizes the oatt timelines and procedures require tps to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports rtos should submit the basis and methods for calculating atc and ttc as well as standardized criteria for curtailment in addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the commission could require that each rto set a date certain by which it will create one control area regardless of the implementation of these two options the commission could standardize atc and ttc methodology staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services details also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region midwest the midwest is dominated by vertically integrated transmission providers tps that control transmission generation and load as such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from tps staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread at the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market tlrs are the most important transmission issue in the midwest with an enormous increase in two zero zero zero the region showed a decline in peak load from one nine nine nine to two zero zero zero and a growth in new generation since the one nine nine eight price spikes even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes tlrs climbed to record numbers the tlrs were highly concentrated only five flowgates account for four one of ecar tlrs and another five flowgates in main account for four two in that region notably even though the nerc procedures for level three tlrs mandate transaction curtailment seven eight of the one nine one tlrs in the midwest do not show any curtailment amount the total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted staff notes that tlr rules are established by nerc whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties while the commission has required certain nerc standards and procedures to be placed in open access transmission tariffs oatt where the commission has the power to enforce provisions under the federal power act in practice the commission has generally deferred to nerc on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of tlrs tlrs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier tlr procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat in addition the nerc idc can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate the impact could be mitigated by one control area per rto staff notes that the midwest state commissions did not petition ferc for price caps following the one nine nine eight price spikes some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that nug construction increased in the midwest market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including tlr curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for atc and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct unbelievably key data was unavailable to staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when tlrs were called and importexport data this lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time as such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions staff also noted that because the security coordinators often work for the iou there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the iou staff cites richard tabors paper transmission markets stretching the rules for fun and profit staff cites the lack of information on oasis or on the nerc web site particularly about real time tlrs and curtailments examples were provided to staff of transmission refusals when there were no tlrs posted and improper implementation of tlrs causing substantial financial loss the currently proposed midwest rtos may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load these incentives will continue to remain until the rto exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions staff notes that the midwest is a balkanized region of six one control areas with no uniform method for calculating atc and cbm the result is that atcs can be different on two different sides of an interface staff notes examples in inaccurate atcs and states that staffs own atc audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints staff is weighing followup options the result of these problems is a lack of liquidity staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market staffs audit of oasis sites revealed several areas of noncompliance information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including atc cbm trm and load flow input data tps have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load this incentive will still exist under rtos if utilities are allowed to calculate their own atc as a consequence the commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff the commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the tps to retain data including current realtime network status interconnection issues ipps need to be compensated for var support also staff cites a number of hotline complaints about tps seeking large deposits or failing to complete system impact studies timely one solution is to have the rto handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against ipps the current practice of requiring ipps to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the entergy source and sink order the commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants while staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances southeast the traditional vertically integrated utility viu model has largely persisted in the se this continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate ipp activities in many cases the vius have dampened ipp involvement without violating any commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of atc tps have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many tlrs there is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the se atcs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices tva despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the se this is significant because of tvas size and location ipps have reported tvas discouragement of siting in tva through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies in addition staff cites the florida sup ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in florida staff discusses the significant flow of power from the midwest to the se this summer much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages se utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales less used than in the midwest the se region lacks information which has retarded the staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the se including atc and tlrs market participants seem to have less confidence in the se market than in any other market region this appears to be justified based on staffs investigations this lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets staff concludes that the commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the se rtos since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations the investigation found numerous problems in bad atcs and ttcs and poor oasis postings in addition several oasis audit logs actually erased historical data staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted staff could not obtain summer demand data and the commissions lack of jurisdiction over tva made it difficult to obtain transmission access information the staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits in addition the tps have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the ipp approached the tp to interconnect staff cites the recent skygen order in which southern denied skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an eight zero mile five zero zero kv line that would take eight years to complete staff solutions include allowing network requests by ipps and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory atc variations are a big problem in the se serc coordination of a standardized atc is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the commission an improved method and improved communication are needed the se experienced a three five four increase in tlrs this summer this increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the se staff cites information provided by charles y that an ameren tlr was not implemented according to nerc criteria staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since tps do not generally refund transmission revenues when tlrs are implemented rtos must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints in addition rtos will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to tlrs however if control areas are retained vius will retain mixed incentives as noted in the midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information this is an issue that the formation of rtos may not resolve eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information finally staff describes specific problems with tva and fpl tva is a problem area for the eastern interconnect grid tva is a transmission bottleneck due to the many tlrs called this summer the current federal law and lack of commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area tva simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service in addition the commission does not have full information on tva staff lists a number of complaints against tva including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing tva marketing but not others to sink and park power staff concludes that recent proposals by tva to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential a staff audit of fpl revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on fpls transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on ems systems that were available to fpls merchant function staffs report found that fpl does not have an established procedure for review of ems to ensure that information is not displayed in error it is up to individual managers discretion frcc web site report dated nine

clineenron_developmentenron_development subject re marktomarket sandeep i met with bob today and discussed the deal structure we put together on the marktomarket issue bob and his colleague wess told me that as long as payments are tied to one particular plant we cannot mtm them they had same problem with plants here in the us like the peaking plants and they had to separate the plant from power sales to be able to mtm the assocated cashflows what they did is they sold power from the plant to an outside party and bought it back from them at completely different multiple locations the buyback is not tied to any specific plant and is marked to maket even if enron can somehow marktomarket a deal with dpc it can do so for only five zero of the cashflows because only five zero of dpc is owned by outsiders and a simple loan to an affiliate cannot also be marked to market bob was suggesting that if eipl buys options from dpc and from some other plants and in turn sells power to ap or karnataka then we could have a case for mtm politically dpc selling power to eipl may not be the best solution to put it rather mildly our alternatives as i see them are one do the deal as we structured it the only difference is that enron doesnt mark it to market and income is earned only in two zero zero two zero three two do the deal as we structured it eiplenron then sells the contract to another party at a profit the problem of course is finding this party and forking part of the profit to them three same deal except revenue securitization is done through an outside party in india not eipl bob said he will think about the issues some more this week let me know when you will be here next week so we can meet with bob together i will be going to boston for tuesday andor wednesday

spoken to you about on the phone i thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction by phone so i am having krishnarao who is in vinces group explain the transaction to you krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in india and he has just returned to houston from india after working with the team here he will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction i would like you to please spend some time with him and then based on the discussion please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from the indian side this is a very important transaction for us and we may need to repeat this in coming months hence setting up the system to account for these maybe well worth it also what i am concerned about is that there will be an enron india eipl account in india based on indian gaap and upon consolidation there will be a us gaap accounting in the us it is here that we would like to have marktomarket accounting eipl is structured through mauritius and then caymen islands another key question to consider is that when we mtm the transaction in the us there will be a tax accruing in the year of mtm say two zero zero zero however in india as a result of the accrual accounting there will not be any income showing till the year two zero zero two or two zero zero three we will need to know how that would get treated and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the us i am also confused about whether us tax would be levied since none of the income is being brought back into the us remains overseas subpartf and other concerns finally we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and getting a fixed for floating swap in the us this is still not allowed to indian corporates i need you to think about this too and see if some type of accounting will solve this issue krishna knows what i am talking about and will brief you on the same krishna please walk bob through the three structures we had worked here look forward to your help and comments this is going to be an exciting

received is that the whole project should be presented and dealt with as an area project serving several countries inclusive of jordan ie the hub approach it is very important that it is promoted this way or there might be a big risk of leaving the image or consideration that this is just purely a jordanian project without a broader scope regards hamdi original message from elhage charles

amman on the subject of egypt gas in summary the prime minister and oil minister are open to discuss this project in the context of clear future needs estimated at four zero zero bcf by two zero zero five as a matter of fact the oil minister wael sabri brought in his senior team to the meeting and scheduled a working session with enron for september two seven at one zero zero zero am in addition the royal court diwan support this development and has sent to the meetings dr bassem awadallah the economic advisor to king abdullah the amoco deal is dead they had an axclusivity arrangement which ended recently and they had in mind a pricing scheme linked to the fuel being used currently or to oil prices both of which were totally unacceptable to jordan whatever deal there is will need to compete against the odds that the deal with irak which provides jordan with virtually free oil will keep as it is in fact it is this deal which has allowed the government to procrastinate on the amoco discussions jordan is comfortable that there is gas in risha close to the irak border schlumberger are currently exploring in that region the thing is that the government is convinced that whatever gas they may find in risha should not prevent them fromstriking a deal for an import scheme the government has been approached by the saleh kamel group of saudi arabia which believes thay may be able to set up a new company which will develop gas fields in the northwestern part of saudi tabouk and export it to jordan this is still at a very preliminary stage but appears to be of great interest to the jordanians in addition british gas approached the minister with a new scheme relying on gas discovered off the coast of gaza and israel which will require a shorter pipeline the thing is that the jordanians feel uncomfortable with imports through israel at this stage of the peace process so here we are welcome to pitch into this situation i used the argument of speed of development and this is something we need to check with the egyptians the course of action is as follows one enron is to issue a letter to the jordan energy minister asap stating the opportunity and formally requesting discussions no middleman pleasethis was clearly stated by the pm and the minister the address is he eng wael sabri minister of energy mineral resources pobox one four zero zero two seven amman jordan fax no nine six two six five eight six five three seven three phone no nine six two six five eight one one three three eight a fax will do as far as the minister is concerned two a meeting has been scheduled on september two seven at one zero zero zero am in the ministers office it is likely to be attended by ahmad bashir secretary general of the ministry and rashad aburas advisor to the minister national electric power co plus some other people three based on the demand projections and timing the jordanians expect some kind of a formal proposal time of important as other competing schemes may have political or technical delays fellows the jordanians are supportive of the scheme and its sponsors so we need to capitalize on this in line with my phone discussions with rob i will try to rearrange the meeting for monday sept two five and if possible our meeting in cairo for sunday sept two four i will keep you posted any thoughts on the competing schemes are most welcome

customers d uring tuesdays meeting the commission accepted the two two restrictions placed on the project by the arizona power plant and transmission line siting com mittee after hearing from several representatives of the bowie and willcox communities the commissioners approved an amendment offered by commission er spitzer the spitzer amendment specifically addresses concerns by nearby pistachio farmers that groundwater pumping could affect the surrounding wa ter table summary of the spitzer amendment the amendment requires southwe stern power group ii to establish and pay for a groundwater

zero zero to a groundwater impact mitigation fund until the fund reaches a balance of five zero zero zero zero zero any business or individual who can pro ve through successful arbitration that

for ground subsidence and earth fissure monitori ng subsidence is a potential side effect of groundwater pumping cracks f issures or dips can form in the surface of the earth because the water deep

emergency response and hazardou s materials training for firefighters making arrangements with local law enforcement and the cochise county sheriff because the project will involv e an increase in traffic and may result in the need for emergency responses by local law enforcement this was an amendment sponsored by commissioner jim irvin prior to construction of the facility southwestern must provi de the commission with a technical study showing that sufficient transmissi on capacity exists to accommodate the output of the plant and the effect of its output on reliable operation of the electric grid conditions requir ing compliance with air and water quality standards imposed by the arizona department of environmental quality and the arizona department of water res ources additionally the applicant will have to participate in and comply with all standards for safe reliable power delivery i was pleased to sup port this project in part because it includes solar

Day 3 Summary -- Tariff Standardization,rto week day three october one seven two zero zero one standardizing rto tariffs the morning panel focused on which transmission services should be standardized in rto tariffs across an interconnection or the entire country there were many diverse views on the panel and the staff and commissioners were somewhat more engaged in this session the panelists were ricky bittle arkansas electric coop jim caldwell american wind peter esposito dynegy rory mcminn new mexico psc glenn ross dominion resources audrey zibelman xcel energy general observations this panel had a lot less agreement than the previous panels dynegy opposes standardization of a transmission tariff and urges ferc to give strong guidance to stakeholders and then let the stakeholders work out the details of a new tariff dominion advocates a more prescriptive approach by ferc noting that stakeholders have been unable to reach agreement over the last five years excel has its own focus they want to be an itc and want to provide many of the rto services without being an rto the wind group is mostly concerned about the ability to provide generation on an as available basis the commissioner from new mexico does not want standardization does not want ferc stepping on the states jurisdictional toes and does not want new mexico ratepayers rates to go up arkansas electric coop insists that spp transmission capacity is full so if competitors want to move power through spp new transmission must first be built i am somewhat concerned that some of the commissioners may believe that tariff standardization is not necessary while the dynegy concept had merit at one time it may be too late to rely on the stakeholder process to resolve issues and it could take many months to go through the process only to have ferc in the end decide the details anyway we may want to submit comments on this issue to ferc at the conclusion of rto week what services should be standardized overall dynegy opposes standardizing tariffs but believes certain aspects of reservations should be standardized timing confirmation processing maintenance issues bus names ramping protocols assumptions for atc calculations posting times bumping rules and settlement time with regard to congestion management it should not be standardized between rtos xcel does not support a standardized tariff but urges ferc to standardize some issues such as cbm calculations reserve obligations and load balancing and penalties american wind says ferc must focus on having liquid spot markets in rtos and not worry about tariff standardization dominion cautions ferc about dynegys proposal to let the industry work out the details he says this is what happened with order no two zero zero zero and the industry was unable to work it out should ferc retain cbm ricky arkansas coop believes that the bigger the rto the less important cbm is because the rto will have enough resources internally to effectuate reserve sharing dynegy thinks cbm should be eliminated dominion thinks cbm should be retained but the rules need to be changed cbm should not be set for a year it changes on a daily basis and this should be reflected nor should cbm be standardized because needs vary region to region however because cbm is used for load the cost of cbm should be allocated to load all panelists agreed with the concept that if cbm is retained load should be required to purchase it as a service provided under the tariff network versus point to point service peter dynegy discussed the need to develop a new type of transmission service that combines the best features from network and point to point similar to transportation service offered in gas firm and interruptible peter suggests starting with the crt tariff proposed several years ago glenn dominion thinks the crt is outdated and thinks we need a new type of service but agrees that it should combine the best elements of network and point to point should all transmission service be under the rtos tariff most of the panelists said yes all service should be under the tariff but ricky bittle said there needs to be a transition period minimum of five years no more than one zero years commissioner mcminn said no he sees this as an infringement on the states jurisdiction what services need to be changed under a new rto tariff jim wind believes that the imbalance provisions must be revised so as not to penalize as available resources ricky thinks transmission expansion is the most important issue to address in a new tariff xcel urges ferc to recognize the distinction between rtos and itcs and allow itcs to design and offer their own transmission tariffs ray alvarez will circulate a summary of the afternoon panel on cost allocation please let me know if you have any questions sarah,20:54:22,No

to be involved in media outreach and interviews and finally i have attached supporting documents that you can use as background material to prep for your responses to any media inquiries that you may receive this week one we are drafting a pitch letter to send out by the end of this week via blast email and fax to the following media lists one capitol press corps reporters two mainstream media reporters working the energy crisis and three trade media we may also outreach to our editorial board list as well our pitch will be focused on what it will really mean for small business and ci customers to lose the option of retail choice at a time when they are suffering the financial hardships of skyrocketing energy bills we will address the effect on californias future business climate if direct access is not preserved through legislation that corrects the problems that abone x caused for retail choice and finally we will address the point that no matter what direction california ultimately takes direct access must be a part of the solution reporters have seen the recent polls which illustrate california businesses concerns with the path the state is on so this is a prime opportunity to build on those recent media stories two we recommend a conference call with arem and the direct access coalition on friday to address the questions and suggestions on the press strategy outlined here three determine which people in the direct access coalition are willing to take media calls on behalf of the coalition next week one follow up with key reporters who received the pitch letter two evaluate the language of sb two seven x and determine whether there will be an opportunity to hold a news conference with sen bowen in the near future monitor movement at the puc and determine whether a press conference may be effective in this arena or whether we may need to use the option of sending a media alert before the march seven hearing followed by a news release after the hearing three place opeds opinion pieces with key newspapers four contact radio news shows and tv public affairs shows ie california capitol week and the california report to secure media interviews five revise the sb two seven x fact sheet attached to reflect the realities of the amended language in sb two seven x what we need from you one if you are willing to speak with the media or you have customersclients with a positive direct access story to tell please respond to this email as soon as you can with your name and contact information two if you have draft opeds written that need to be placed with newspapers on behalf of your association and the broader coalition we are willing to do this for the you three if you have colleagues andor staff that are already working with

brazilian regulations for swaps prepays antonio felix as enron is finding several opportunities involving financial derivatives in brazil we would like to get from tozzini freire law firm a summarized but concise read on the cans and cannots of these type of transactions in brazil here is my understanding of the regulations from the memo you have already sent to us regarding swaps and prepays as well as a list of the most common examples of deals that enron would be encountering in the marketplace i would appreciate if you could comment on what is written here and also add further information so enron can have some sort of menu of deals of this nature that can be pursued i would like to ask you to add your comment in this same message to make the review process a little easier thank you inadvance for your attention swaps pulp paper petrochem power otc swaps the central bank regulates swap transactions involving local financial institutions acting either as dealers for their own account or as intermediaries to the contracting parties when the financial institutions act as intermediaries the agreements are in fact private agreements negotiated by two nonfinancial companies but become subject to the requirements and regulations normally applicable to swaps involving financial institutions according to regulations currently in force such swaps can relate to exchange rates interest rates gold and price indices all of the swap agreements involving financial institutions must be registered with cetip or with another custody and clearing system authorized by the central bank or the cvm brazilian sec as a matter of practice the agreements used by the banks that participate in the swap market do not follow a standard form since normally each bank has a particular sample form with which it feels more comfortable derivatives in addition to exchangetraded derivatives and otc swaps involving financial institutions there is no legal impediment in principle to derivatives transactions being privately negotiated and entered into between two interested parties as a general rule in brazil as long as no specific prohibition is found in the law parties are free to negotiate agreements that best suit their interests international hedge central bank regulations authorize that brazilian companies enter into transactions abroad either in exchanges or having a financial institution as their counterpart to hedge against the fluctuation of interest rates exchange rates or commodity prices in the international markets such hedge transactions must refer to payments in foreign currency scheduled to be made by or to the brazilian company in respect of commercial or financial rights or obligations or to payments in local currency arising out of certain financial obligations subject to the variation of exchange rates and payments relating to imports exports or local transactions involving commodities priced according to their valuation in foreign exchanges the commercial market exchange rates are applicable to foreign exchange agreements referring to remittances of currency in connection with hedge transactions when the underlying obligationright is registered with the central bank the corresponding hedge transaction must be informed to the central bank within one zero days of its execution when there is no registration with the central bank the banks executing the foreign exchange agreements relating to the hedge transaction must verify the existence of the obligationright being hedged examples commodity swap between two brazilian companies as per what has been said above there is nothing that precludes enron brazil of entering into a swap with another brazilian company regarding any commodity traded by enron pulp paper petrochem products power gas enron does not need to be a financial institutions to provide swaps transactions on the other hand i am not sure yet on the following points one does such swap agreement should be registered with cetip or any other clearing system to be valid under brazilian regulations two what are the taxes involved in a swap commodity swap between a brazilian company and an offshore company this kind of deal seems to be also available in the brazilian market and the only difference from example one would be the fact that it must be registered with the central bank and it would involved transfer of foreign currency commodity swap between two offshore companies but involving brazilian exports i am not sure if brazilian regulations would have anything to do with a transaction like this one i would assume that a brazilian exporter would sell to their offshore subsidiary and such subsidiary would sell to their end customer enron would step in and offer a swap agreement for the offshore subsidiary of the brazilian company therefore enron would not have any involvement with brazilian regulations because it would not be dealing with brazil prepays pulp paper petrochem power the regulations currently in force governing export prepayments especially central bank of brazils cartacircular two six two four of february one four one nine nine six establish that all repayments of principal under such transactions must necessarily be made by means of shipments of the relevant exported goods cartacircular two six two four allows cash remittances abroad only in regard to payments of interest under the facility therefore it is not possible to structure a transaction where the repayment of principal will be made only in cash or where the borrower has the ability to choose between paying cash or exporting the goods a transaction that involves structuring a direct loan to the brazilian company where the value of the principal of which would be tied to the price of the relevant commodity is very difficult to be approved under a direct loan registered with the central bank the borrower may remit all due amounts of principal and interest in accordance with the schedule of payments attached to the certificate of registration the problem with such alternative is that although there are no express regulations preventing it to do so the central bank will most probably not issue a prior authorization for such type of loan as it only normally issues authorizations for normal loans where the principal is a fixed amount and the interest rate is either a fixed rate or a floating rate normally based on libor or us treasury it should also be noted that generally speaking all interest payments under such an agreement are subject to withholding tax at the rate of one five pa cc five account a possible alternative way to structure a prepay would be by using a nonregistered loan with the central bank under such alternative the funds disbursed by enron under the loan would be remitted to brazil through an international transfer of brazilian currency as allowed by circular two six seven seven of the central bank of brazil the international transfer of brazilian currency international transfer is a system which uses a nonresident current account in brazil and the brazilian interbank foreign exchange market to effect remittances of funds to and from brazil under such system a lender that wishes to disburse funds to a brazilian borrower makes a foreign currency deposit with a bank located outside of brazil offshore bank and instructs the offshore bank to deliver such dollars to a brazilian bank in exchange for brazilian currency such brazilian currency is then deposited in a nonresident account held by the offshore bank in brazil and thereafter transferred to the borrower the repayments follow the inverse procedure ie the borrower deposits the amount in a nonresident account of an offshore bank and instructs it to exchange the funds into foreign currency and deliver them to the lender abroad the main differences between the registered loans and the nonregistered loans are that the nonregistered loans are not subject to prior approval by the central bank of brazil and therefore not subject to scrutiny as to their minimum tenors and applicable interest rates and the applicable foreign exchange rate to nonregistered loans is the floating rate as opposed to the commercial rate of exchange all transfers of funds to brazil as international transfers are subject to a financial transactions tax iof at the rate of two on the amount transferred plus a bank fee that normally ranges from zero four to zero six of such amount any interest payments under a nonregistered loan are subject to withholding tax at the rate of one five or two five if the lender is located in a taxhaven jurisdiction i dont think this type of transaction is the best way to circumvent some of the brazilian regulations regarding prepayment given the bad press that deals via the cc five account mechanism would bring to enron but i have it addressed just in case someone does not share the same opinion examples financial prepay between two brazilian companies not allowed unless the company providing the prepay qualifies as a financial institution as per brazilian law since it will not be the case in enrons cases we should not focus in these kind of transactions financial prepay between a brazilian company and an offshore company as it has been mentioned before it is allowed as long as enron can structure the prepay in way where there is a preestablished amortization schedule for principal and interest it is very hard to structure a prepay with specific split between principal and interest because the objective of the prepay is to lock on a certain volume of a product and not on a specific price therefore if enron prepays for a specific product on a floating basis the attached value of that commodity can go up or down as the market fluctuates as well as the total value associate to the deal such value can be either principal or interest and it is impossible to determine what it will be financial prepay between two offshore companies but one being a subsidiary of a brazilian entity i think there is no restrictions in this case given the whole deal will be closed offshore and the brazilian authorities are not going to be involved it will most likely be a deal involving three parties a company in brazil its offshore subsidiary and enron physical prepay between two brazilian companies no restrictions physical prepay between a brazilian company and an offshore company no restrictions as long as there is physical deliveries physical prepay between two offshore companies but involving brazilian exports no restrictions it would also involve three parties a company in brazil its offshore subsidiary and enron thanks gustavo,04:10:00,"Yes

 Northwest Refund Case",richard we need to make some decisions very soon this morning about enrons submission of data into the pacific northwest pnw refund case the data is due at ferc no later than thursday august one six the key strategic issues in submitting the data to the alj include the following one do we exclude bookouts ie only physical transactions it appears that other market participants intend to exclude bookouts epmi should also exclude bookouts given that these transactions never went physical and hence are not appropriate to consider in this case two do we provide only sales transactions or do we include our purchases the aljs order allows parties to include purchases only if the selling party is not an intervenor in this case and hence our purchase would not be included in the data the alj wants to limit the amount of data to be provided to ease the workload our initial analysis of some data from other parties is that there will be transaction data irregularities and hence we should provide all of our relevant sales and purchases by having the data in the case we can dispute any inappropriate transaction and ensure that all of our purchases are included in the calculation of refunds this is key for enron in that our primary defense is that enron deserves refunds as a purchaser to offset any sales refund amount three do we provide data for all four time blocks through two four hours through seven days through one month through one year the aljs order indicates that parties are to provide data for transactions that are not consistent with the initial definition of spot deals less than two four hours done day ahead or day of our initial recommendation is to provide the data but to retain our arguments that this is not consistent with fercs order the primary downside of not complying with this element of the data submission request is that we anger the alj and end up providing the data anyway after being told directly to comply in addition it is possible that by providing all of the data we could be creating the problem that some economist or competitor could get their hands on the data at a later date and determine our trading strategies weighing these risks i would still recommend to include this data but argue before the alj and the ferc the ultimate relevance four do we provide data based on contract date the alj has requested data for contracts that were valid on december two five two zero zero zero that had physical energy flowing after december two five two zero zero zero through june two zero two zero zero one this would explicitly include balance of the month transactions for december two zero zero zero and the associated physical flows to minimize the hours on these transactions we intend to enter the transaction date in the data submission to allow for ferc staff to delete inappropriate transactions i will call you this morning thanks jim,05:48:29,No

officials deny price gouging by doug smith and rich connell and robert j lopez times staff writers during the peak of californias power crisis the los angeles department of water and power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials have previously acknowledged according to a newly completed independent audit the document obtained by the times under the california public records act seems sure to reinforce charges by some consumer advocates that the public power company effectively helped its customers at the expense of those suffering blackouts and rate hikes the audit also undercuts efforts by gov gray davis and others to pin the blame for rising energy costs mainly on private outofstate generating companies for months dwp officials have deflected questions about their prices by insisting that the agency sold power for just one five above its costs as recently as july former dwp chief s david freeman who now heads davis new statewide power authority repeated that assurance in a letter to us senators probing the energy meltdown but the audit findings show that dwps profits from electricity sales to powerstarved areas of the state averaged five six last year under freemans stewardship overall during the worst one three months of the crisis ending in may records show that the dwp profited two zero zero million on sales of six eight zero million it says it is still owed one eight zero million beyond those higher profits the dwp included expenses in its cost component that have little to do with generating electricity they include a three four million cut for the citys general fundessentially a bonus for the utilitys ownerand an additional four two million in overhead for such things as debt payment and return on the agencys capital investments these overhead charges are three times higher than the amount considered reasonable by federal regulators in effect unsuspecting ratepayers across the state whose utilities have been battered by debt are helping to pick up the tab for services that dwp consumers and city taxpayers would otherwise have to pay in an interview late last week freeman defended those costs and dwps profits saying the agency went out of its way to help the state avert blackouts by cranking up its output from costly plants he insisted that he had issued standing orders to sell power at a profit of no more than one five we made a fair amount of money it was not price gouging said freeman who contends that he led efforts to cap spiraling wholesale prices last year freeman said he has not seen the audit but if profits were higher than one five then im not embarrassed about it it says nothing more than theres enterprise at the dwp the dwps new general manager david wiggs said that his staff had found no documentation as of friday to confirm the existence of a strict pricing policy within the agency during freemans tenure maybe in hindsight wiggs said it would have been better not to be so specific but to say look were gonna limit our recovery to a reasonable return for our customers still wiggs said even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated it was not excessive we charged just and reasonable rates he said adding that the dwp now offers the state electricity with no profit margin wiggs ordered the audit in may as questions intensified about the role of the dwp and other public power agencies in driving up the price of wholesale electricity during periods of scarcity conducted by the auditing firm of pricewaterhousecoopers the study targeted a one three month period beginning in may two zero zero zero the results have provided critics with new ammunition taking advantage of residents in one part of the state to benefit residents in another part is not fair said harry snyder senior advocate for consumers union this kind of behavior is what we expect from banks savings and loans and insurance companiesnot a public agency sen fred thompson of tennessee the ranking republican on the governmental affairs committee which is investigating the crisis was one of those recently assured by freeman in writing that dwps profits were limited to one five this is a cause for concern and deserves greater scrutiny he said after learning of the audit it would be ironic if it turns out that the la department of water and power was charging more than gov davis texas pirates said thompson the dwp became a key player in the energy crisis last year when the states deregulation of electricity began to backfire with supply from the private generators contracting and wholesale prices exploding to keep the power flowing the dwpwhich had opted out of deregulationcranked up its generating capacity and sold the extra electricity into the california market this helped avert even more extensive blackouts than the state experienced at the same time however the dwp and other publicly owned utilities in california and elsewhere charged some of the highest prices during the crisis official reports would later show freeman repeatedly said the utilitys prices were high because it was forced to use its most costly inefficient plants but the audit raises such serious questions about the dwps behavior that the matter has spilled into the two zero zero two gubernatorial contest former los angeles mayor richard riordan a possible republican challenger to davis last week moved to distance himself from the profits racked up by the dwp during his city hall tenure in a letter to his successor james k hahn the former mayor said he only recently learned that the agency may have exceeded its stated profit ceiling if so he said the city should consider cutting a deal with the utilities and the state to reduce the estimated one eight zero million the city says it is still owed from earlier sales a riordan spokesman said the former mayor deferred to the dwp to set prices for its electricity the mayor never directed them to generate a profit from these sales said jaime de la vega a senior advisor to riordans campaign committee freeman now squarely in the davis camp disputes riordans account he said the mayor repeatedly questioned the agencys pricing strategy he wanted to charge more according to freeman in case the city only got a partial payment from pacific gas electric and southern california edison which were slipping into insolvency freeman described riordans view as if were gonna continue to sell it to them we ought to get a lot of money he was thinking of it the way a good businessman thinks of it for the most part the davis administration has gone light on public agencies that have profited in californias haywire energy market freeman contends that other suppliers drove prices higher through aggressive bidding practices that lifted the entire market including his agency but according to a report by the states grid operator dwp was one of the most aggressive along with the trading arm of bc hydro the governmentowned utility in british columbia yet another reportthis one by the states powerbuying agencyfound that the dwp and some other public utilities charged higher than average prices during the first quarter of this year the report said dwp charged an average of two nine two per megawatt hour asking more than many private generators it could not be determined how much the utility was charging per megawatt hour last year when its profit margin was even higher even after the market problems cited by freeman were corrected earlier this year the dwp collected profits more than four zero higher than it claimed to have netted records show overall during the one three month period audited profits averaged two nine double the return the agency has publicly stated it was receiving although davis and his aides have tried to keep the focus on texasbased energy suppliers republican lawmakers in sacramento and washington have been broadening the debate to include the conduct of governmentowned utilities one key question is whether those agencies like private suppliers should be forced to refund excess profits the primary venue for refund orders has been the federal energy regulatory commission which is expected to rule in december on whether the state should receive the billions of dollars it claims to have been overcharged dwp insists it is outside the commissions jurisdiction but some california legislators argue that state law may give them authority to demand refunds from public utilities the leading proponent of that course is state sen ray haynes rriverside in a letter to a senate investigating committee last month he said he fears that the continuing disclosures about the dwp and others are merely the tip of the iceberg relating to greed of instate public utility agencies the chairman of that committee sen joe dunn dsanta ana said his panel will examine the activities of these agencies in the months ahead state faces crunch time to deal with electricity costs energy with one week left in the legislative session lawmakers and regulators want to resolve questions on how california will recoup its expenditures during power crisis after a summer of delays california regulators and legislators are aiming in one final week to resolve issues crucial to millions of electricity customers and the financial stability of the state and its utilities the energy crisis that caused blackouts early this year has receded but it has left behind a potential fiscal crisis the state needs to recoup more than eight billion that it has spent on power and it has signed four three billion in longterm electricity contracts final plans for meeting these financial obligationsand spreading the pain of paying them offhave been debated for months but the decision time has come legislators are scheduled to recess for the year on friday and the state public utilities commission is under pressure to act on several longpending measures at a meeting on thursday whats before the state both at the puc and the legislature is how are we going to provide power to people in the years to come puc president loretta m lynch said in an interview are we going to have a healthy utility to provide the power or are we going to rely on the state the puc which approved the biggest rate increase in history earlier this year now faces another tough choice should it surrender its formerly ironclad authority over electricity rates to the state department of water resources an agency that has come under fire for alleged conflicts of interest and the cost of its contracts or should it balk and jeopardize the states planned sale of bonds to replenish the treasury and repay loans legislation on related issues legislators are grappling with two complicated and highly contested bills on related issues one seeks to repair the finances of southern california edison through a two nine billion aid plan backed by gov gray davis the other would limit the powers of the department of water resources which has been buying electricity for one zero million customers of edison pacific gas electric co and san diego gas electric since january the state law that authorized the department of water resources to buy power exempted the purchases from puc reviews designed to protect consumers from unreasonable charges now the department is seeking a formal agreement with the puc that would guarantee that its cost of supplying power to utility customers will be fully covered critics say the accord is a blank check for future rate increases but the department says no increases will be necessary in the foreseeable future state officials say the puc has little choice but to sign the agreement which they see as necessary to reassure wall street bankers that the department of water resources will be able to repay one two five billion in bonds the state plans to sell to cover power costs the money from those bonds will go in part to repay the state treasury for money laid out for power top state officials including the governor and treasurer want the bond sale to go without a hitch but the date of the sale already has been pushed back several months and threatened litigation could further delay it the urgency over the bonds comes about because the state already has used six billion from the treasury and has taken out a four three billion loan to cover power costs state treasurer phil angelides said that if the bonds are unsold and the economy slows down next year the state could be revisiting the fiscal crisis of the early one nine nine zero s people ought to be laying down their arms over their energy agendas and asking the question what is the best and fastest way to repay the state general fund to ensure critical programs such as education and health get their funding he said lynch one of three davis appointees on the fivemember puc finds herself in a particularly difficult position she sees the value of puc reviews of the reasonableness of power purchases but lynch said if we do not enter into a rate agreement the bonds do not issue and that could affect the state general fund the thing i care about most she added is ensuring the general fund is repaid earlier this month lynch issued a draft decision that would have the puc essentially rubberstamp any future revenue requests or rate increases sought by the department of water resources but she also has publicly endorsed a bill by state sen john burton dsan francisco that the davis administration opposes the bill would ensure that the puc has the right to scrutinize the revenue needs of the department of water resources and hold public hearings it would not however give the puc the power to disallow department expenses to reassure wall street the bill would dedicate a portion of the money that utilities collect from their customers to repaying the bonds at a puc meeting last thursday puc commissioners richard bilas and henry duque appointees of former gov pete wilson voiced support for the burton bill saying it would let the puc shed additional light on the department of water resources powerrelated expenditures the davis administration opposes the bills present form but is seeking amendments one concern is that energy providers would sue out of fear that if money runs short bondholders would be paid before they are the bills passage could be a deal breaker for the bond sales said contractor joseph fichera a financial advisor to davis at the least contentious debate surrounding energyrelated issues could drive up the price of floating bonds fichera said wall street does not like risk conflict implies risk so the more we create the more we are costing ratepayers he said the legislature also is considering a bill that would allow edison to sell bonds to pay off about threequarters of the debt it accrued during the energy crisis the utility would have to handle on its own about one billion owed to large energy companies consumer activists have threatened a ballot initiative to block the bill which they call a bailout the puc on thursday is scheduled to vote on several items designed to ease the sale of the department of water resources bonds one is a rate increase for sdge customers another measure would suspend the right of businesses and other electricity customers to stop buying electricity from their local utility and choose their own power provider the alliance for retail energy markets an organization that includes many large california businesses said its members would be forced to sue if the puc goes ahead with plans to retroactively void the right of customers to choose their own energy providers but the most controversial item has been the proposed puc agreement with the department of water resources consumer groups and utilities alike have called for public examinations of the departments contracts and revenue requirements the plan would allow a state agency to operate behind closed doors while it negotiates with ratepayers money said douglas heller of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica secrecy in dwr leads to conflicts of interest and that leads to higher rates concerns about the department of water resources lack of independent oversight have been heightened by recent developments energy experts have questioned the qualifications of the trading team the department assembled and several traders were fired for alleged conflicts of interest critics seized on reports that the department sold surplus power at a loss of four six million in july although officials say surpluses are bound to occur with longterm power contracts and the departments projections of its revenue needs for future power purchases have been updated and amended twice prompting utilities and others to question the reliability of the figures pge threatens to sue over revenue the utilities want the department to be subject to the sort of reviews that have rankled them for years if the puc does not provide for that lawsuits could be coming pge which already is in bankruptcy has threatened to sue if the department of water resources revenue requirement doesnt leave the utility a sufficient share of the rate increase adopted by state regulators in march pge recently asked a sacramento county superior court judge to require the department of water resources to hold public hearings on its revenue requirements the company has reacted angrily to a draft puc decision to shift six zero zero million of the states cost of buying power from edison to pge saying the plan was illegal and discriminates against pge customers davis aides have defended the department of water resources and its power purchases saying the departments longterm contracts helped cool the energy crisis they look overpriced now fichera said but four months ago they were underpriced compared with the spot market they are an insurance policy against market volatility having the puc review actions of another state agency would be redundant and would serve no purpose fichera said because the contracts already are in place you cant break contracts he said youve got to pay them even some critics acknowledge it is difficult to evaluate the department of water resources performance to date one reason is that the department has closely guarded details about its contracts and its spot purchases arguing that release of too much information would place it at a competitive disadvantage another reason is that market conditions have changed and natural gas prices have declined since the department entered into contracts amid the energy crisis we all have two zero two zero hindsight said puc commissioner bilas when dwr entered into contracts the state was over the barrel now we can say that they are not as good as the department thought and that dwr does a lousy job of negotiating contracts but thats unfair green energy sources seen as ripe for growth by carrie peyton bee staff writer published sept one zero two zero zero one wind and hot water sunshine and rotting garbage they all could keep californias lights on for a price around the state more people are beginning to suggest that price is worth paying to help smooth out the ride on the states power roller coaster this week sacramentos municipal utility will begin hearings on an ambitious one zero year plan that would nearly triple its reliance on nonhydroelectric sources of renewable electric power such as wind farms and solar panels in the legislature a hotly debated bill would require every power seller in the state to provide increasing amounts of green power rising to two zero percent of their portfolios by two zero one zero that would roughly double current supplies this may be the silver lining of the energy crisis if we can get this passed said state sen byron sher dpalo alto author of sb five three two more than a dozen states and many nations already have portfolio standards that require each utility or other power venders to provide a set share of electricity from renewable sources the amounts can be as low as two percent or three percent or as high as three zero partly depending on what gets called renewable environmental and some consumer groups have embraced the idea saying it would bring a constellation of advantages the air would be cleaner they say finite resources such as coal natural gas and other fossil fuels would be used more sparingly and in california the state would be a little less vulnerable next time prices sail through the stratosphere for natural gas the chosen fuel for virtually all new power plants but freemarket advocates and some utilities are dubious they worry that a statemandated portfolio standard would drive up prices it could reward inefficiencies in energy sources that are otherwise too expensive to stand on their own and in the push to diversify from natural gas critics of such standards dont want to see the state turn its back on potentially lower cost power sources including coal nuclear power and new large dams ignoring hydroelectric power is shortsighted and i think not considering nuclear options within the state at least giving it some public hearing is shortsighted said karal cottrell a sacramento municipal utility district director it is a debate that will help shape californias power future and it comes as the state has begun loading up on natural gas plants just over half of instate electricity production now is fueled by natural gas but that could rise to six five percent by two zero one zero if all currently proposed gasfired plants are built said mark bernstein an energy analyst at rand long viewed as relatively cheap and comparatively clean natural gas still could pose risks if it dominates the states power picture we have a very hard time predicting the price of anything particularly energy these days said bernstein what happens if the pressures on price are so great that they go way up that fear has been sobering for the sacramento municipal utility district whose officials worry the utility might be becoming too dependent on two mainstays hydro power with its risks of short supplies in dry years and natural gas already considered a leader in renewable power smud gets about seven percent of its electricity from nonhydro renewables in a series of workshops beginning tuesday it will seek public feedback on a proposed one zero year plan that would raise that amount to one zero percent by two zero zero six and two zero percent by two zero one one if we commit to this this will be the largest renewable commitment i believe in the state right now general manager jan schori told directors renewable power would cost more but the benefits in diversification and price stability should be worth it said smud planning chief jim tracy his proposal calls for spending no more than an extra penny per kilowatthour for renewables at first smud plans to expand its solano county wind farm continue subsidizing solar panels and consider working with the county to expand the kiefer landfill plant which runs on methane seeping out of rotting garbage that should get the utility close to one zero percent by two zero zero three staffers would return to the board with a study on how to reach the far more challenging second phase boosting green power another one zero percent at a livable price the likeliest costeffective sources so far look like wind and geothermal power said tracy thats also the consensus among those who hope the state will pass its own portfolio standard before the legislature adjourns friday wind turbines once disparaged as generating more tax breaks than electricity have become bigger more powerful and far more dependable in the past decade aided by a federal tax credit they now can supply power at between three cents and six cents a kilowatthour depending on location according to the american wind energy association at its lower end that makes wind nearly competitive with a new natural gas plant geothermal power tapped by drilling into underground beds of hot steam or water runs between four five cents and seven cents a kilowatthour and could go lower if it too qualifies for the next round of federal credits plant developers say both sources of power are plentiful in california the state is the one three th best source of wind in the nation with untapped wind resources along mountain ridges running almost the length of the state geothermal power already makes up five percent of the states supply and could rise by thousands of megawatts with rich beds in the imperial valley and elsewhere still not fully tapped by comparison solar power costs more than one zero cents a kilowatthour although it can have special appeal to homeowners living far from power lines or those who want to produce their own electricity both wind and geothermal could be a shooin economically if natural gas prices float higher said matt freedman of the utility reform network a consumer group that usually advocates for lower power costs today its also one of the biggest lobbyists for a renewable portfolio standard we think the standard is going to save consumers money or in the worst case its like an insurance policy said freedman i think consumers are willing for that to be part of the mix these days but with only a week left to go freedman said the enemy of shers bill is time thats actually just one of the enemies others include sempra energy parent company of san diego gas electric co and the california manufacturers association which fear it would boost electric rates when a major thrust of the state is to reduce prices as much as possible is this really a good time for this asked sempra spokesman ed van herik both sempra and the assemblys republican caucus point out that more than one zero zero million a year already is collected from consumers electric bills and funneled into a fund that supports renewable energy the portfolio standard could have californians paying again up to the one five cents per kilowatthour cap in the bill for power that theyve already helped subsidize they say renewable energies are becoming more efficient on their own said assemblyman dennis hollingsworth rtemecula to artificially prop them up will stifle that innovation california already gets about nine percent of its total energy supply including imports from nonhydro renewables and an additional three percent from small hydro the state energy commission predicts that current programs could boost that to one seven percent by two zero zero six so to sher author of the renewables bill raising that amount to two zero percent by two zero one zero is actually a modest goal were well on our way there he said dan walters as davis and burton spar big capitol agenda remains unsettled published sept one zero two zero zero one theres no scientifically objective method of measuring such things the world still awaits the invention of a procrastimeter but its evident that as the final week of the two zero zero one legislative session begins there are an extraordinary number of pithy issues left to be resolved although procrastination is a capitol perennial whats different his year is that so many of them are significant matters of public policy that cannot simply roll over into two zero zero two including major pieces of the energy crisis puzzle such as gov gray davis bailout of southern california edison also on the pending agenda are redrawing legislative and congressional district boundaries multibilliondollar bond issues for schools and colleges a slew of labor benefit bills that business leaders call job killers a drive by trial lawyers to make it easier to open up confidential lawsuit settlements consumer protection measures that include those affecting privacy and predatory lending expansion of rights for gays and undocumented immigrants community college support and a potentially sweeping measure to expand health care access for the states huge uninsured population why has so much been left to the final hours some of it is human nature compounded by political skittishness but the extraordinary amount of serious legislating left to the last minute this year reflects both the unusual circumstances of this years session especially the energy crisis and an escalating conflict between the capitols two most powerful democrats gov gray davis and senate president pro tem john burton the first half of the year was utterly dominated by the energy situation and then by a partisan conflict over the state budget as californias economy softened and revenues dipped sharply other legislative matters drifted until summers heat enveloped the capitol the more important factor may be the davisburton feud which manifests itself in many ways but particularly on the two most important pieces of latesession business the davissponsored edison bailout and a multibilliondollar boost in benefits for workers with jobrelated illnesses and injuries carried personally by burton as it happens the price tag on each is similar the edison measure would authorize the utility to issue two nine billion in bonds to repay its debts and at least in theory step back from the brink of bankruptcy the workers compensation bill sent to davis desk last week would boost benefits by a similar amount each year burton has denounced the edison bill as a raid on ratepayers while davis has in the past vetoed similar workers compensation measures and is being urged to do it again by employers who list it at the top of their job killer bills the two politicians have so much prestige on the line with the two measures that there have been recurrent rumors of a squeeze play in which davis would have to agree to sign the workers comp bill to get his muchcherished edison bailout although no one will say so publicly the burtondavis conflict however is far broader than these two bills they represent in effect the two faces of the democratic party davis the cool businessfriendly centrist and burton the passionate labororiented liberal and their personal relationship is practically nil burton openly despises davis as a betrayer of party principle and trashes him to anyone within earshot davis is more circumspect but those around him contend in effect that if liberals like burton had their way the democratic party would again become anathema to moderate voters and republicans would regain their prominence in the state one reason for this years delays is that a huge wad of liberal legislation including many bills that davis doesnt want to see on his desk is backed up and burton could if he wishes dump it on the governor and make him decide whether to offend business or democratic interest groups it is therefore a game of chicken will burton protect davis from being caught in the middle by holding up the key bills andor agreeing to modifications or will he let the governor sweat caliso violating fed law by making utils buy state pwr zero nine one zero two zero

s grid operator may be in violation of federal regulations by forcing utilities to buy expensive power the state secured under long and shortterm contracts in place of electricity that is available from their own lowcost power plants the california independent system operator the agency that operates the realtime electricity market and maintains reliability of the grid in the state has given priority during the past three months to power the state department of water resources locked in under the four three billion of longterm contracts before utilizing electricity from lowcost power plants according to several executives at the agency greg fishman an iso spokesman said there are times this doesnt happen much when because of varying ramp rates we take a bid out of sequence meaning when one plant has a bid of lets say five zero a megawatthour and another has a six zero bid we may take the six zero bid because it would take longer to deliver the five zero power fishman said the market is not working as it is designed to since the demise of the california power exchange we the industry have been forced to make the market function given the tools that we have fishman said the px was a major portion of the market without it we are left trying to put the market back into shape given the current players in the market however the isos federal tariff states that the agency must use the cheapest electricity available in the wholesale market before dispatching the more expensive electricity to generators and retail customers the iso shall dispatch generating unitsto meet its imbalance energy requirements based on order of energy bid prices reads a section of the rules approved by the federal energy regulatory commission the iso shall not discriminate between generating units system units loads and system resources other than based on price and the effectiveness location and ramp rate of the resource concerned to respond to the fluctuation in demand or generation fishman acknowledged that the market is not working as it is designed to but he said the iso would not respond to specific questions related to the possibility that the agency has violated its federal tariff or other issues related to the operation of the iso market we are looking into a variety of issues surrounding that dysfunction and in due course we will answer those issues he said agency fails to reveal price data for dwr power moreover the iso has failed to disclose on its web site the price of the dwr power which is also required under federal regulations jan smutnyjones executive director of the independent energy producers association a trade group representing large and small power producers said there is absolutely no transparency in the iso market no one knows what theyre paying for the dwr which started buying power in lieu of california s ailing utilities in january signed four three billion in longterm supply contracts over the past six months at prices that now exceed the spot market price for electricity the dwr at times has had a surplus of electricity and has sold some of it into the spot market at a one one five million loss over the last three months as a result the iso has ordered the mohave generating station a coalfired power plant in nevada capable of producing electricity at roughly two cents a kilowatthour to reduce output at the facility fishman said the one five zero zero megawatt mohave unit is majority owned by edison international eix unit southern california edison fishman said last week that the iso is investigating the

year according to the government agency while other regions dont face the same problems as california solution providers see plenty of opportunity to deliver ups solutions across the united states the combination of daily thunderstorms old buildings and louisiana heat and humidity led software stuff to include ups solutions in every recent project says gary shurman president of the metairie labased solution provider we do a lot of accounting software solutions and we wont install a network without a ups on every server workstation hub and router says shurman when we get a severe thunderstorm roll through here many times power will be out from a few minutes to a few hours you really get some equipment damage from that implementing ups solutions up front reduces software stuffs maintenance and warranty costs shurman says you dont have to make service calls or replace equipment because of intermittent failures he says adds chris boaglio senior channel manager for vars and computer distribution at mge ups systems a costa mesa califbased ups vendor the power issue will be on the minds of solution providers and customers for the next six months to a year in some instances a ups is considered a necessary peripheral most customers need backup that is failsafe but the pain level is not there to spend money while customers arent clamoring for power protection now as they were when the california outages were at the top of the news theres still money to be made says joe wolf president of compusystems a washington mobased solution provider we have seen a lot of thunderstorms in our area and weve replaced more than two zero zero modems in the last three weeks wolf says but we still have to keep up the fight its an ongoing thing you need to remind the customers every single time compusystems doesnt include ups solutions when bidding projects he says but it reminds customers before any contracts are signed how important power protection can be for their business systems meanwhile ups vendors are using web seminars and other training methods to ensure that solution providers can deliver an effective message about upses to end users were working hard to make sure solution providers are armed with tools to help their customers whether theyre dealing with an existing powerprotection solution or the end user doesnt have anything at all says john donovan director of reseller strategy at american power conversion west kingston ri businesses in the united states lose about five zero billion annually because of power outages according to a recent report issued by the electrical power research institute such statistics can be used to sell ups solutions say solution providers even in a small business the first time you have an outage you could put five zero employees out of business for a day that could cost you up to two zero zero zero zero plus lost sales compare that loss to the cost of an inexpensive battery says software stuffs shurman but end users are growing accustomed to having upses installed in new networks he says its usually pretty painless with a new sale for existing customers that dont have upses we go in with powermeasuring equipment and prove to them whats happening with their power says shurman when you show them what the spikes and drops look like for a two four hour period they get the picture but without that upses can be a hard sell he says the customer would call an electrician who would use a meter reader and say youve got one two zero volts so youre fine the global ups market is expected to generate six four billion

deployed in that space but ups vendors remain bullish on longterm opportunities that may arise from powerrelated issues in california fundamental fixes arent in place slotten says theres still a trend to consume more and more power then youve got the bush administration talking about building more power plants but thats a decade off smaller lighter faster its been said that good things come in small packages well it seems that folks in the ups business are warming up to the old adage for a while the ups earned itself a reputation as the pcs ball and chaina clunky addon that always seemed to get in the way but thanks to technology advances powerprotection systems are becoming lighter more compact and less expensive say vendor executives one thing thats been a hindrance in the ups market is the size and weight of the products because of transformers and batteries says chris boaglio senior channel manager for vars and computer distribution at mge ups systems a costa mesa califbased ups manufacturer transformers are extremely heavy components that add shipping costs and size to a product but some newer upses weigh up to three zero percent less than their predecessors and dont

two zero zero one dow jones company inc of dow jones newswires this article was originally published friday washington dow jones an expedited federal energy regulatory commission administrative hearing on claims for two billion in refunds on electricity sales in the pacific northwest concluded thursday after three days of legal wrangling the proceeding which ferc spun off from a highprofile controversial case involving california s powerrefund claims poses a legal and logistical hornets nest for the commission according to attorneys involved power sellers subject to a possible ferc refund order themselves potentially could seek refunds for power they purchased in the region untold billions of dollars of these socalled ripple refund claims were held in abeyance by the ferc administrative law judge presiding in the case but if ferc orders refunds these power sellers have reserved the right to seek refunds which in some cases could amount to more than they ultimately owe but thats a longterm issue more immediate is the power sellers constitutional dueprocess concerns about the expedited proceeding which allowed limited evidence and crossexamination of witnesses then theres the problem of defining what is a spotmarket sale in what is largely a bilateral contracts market various refund claims address not only sales of two four hours duration but monthlong blocks and in some cases longer than a year meanwhile municipal utility sellers technically not subject to ferc regulatory jurisdiction under the federal power act are challenging the commissions assertion of authority to order them to make refunds municipal utilities make up roughly half of the pacific northwest market and finally the case has turned into a second bite of the apple for california in its effort to obtain refunds roughly one five billion of the total claims is being sought by california with the remainder representing claims from a handful of municipal utilities in the region according to attorneys involved in the proceeding of california s total claim more than five five six million is sought from powerex the us marketing arm of british columbia hydro a provincially owned utility for sales under contracts with the california department of water resources this year i think its completely outrageous that california s asking for money said an attorney involved in the case we wouldnt be here if they hadnt screwed this thing up in the first place most parties in the proceeding have asked the judge to throw out california s claims another attorney noted five municipal northwest utilities seeking refunds only five municipal utilities in the northwest are seeking refunds seattle wash two seven eight million tacoma wash six five four million clark wash public utilities six four million eugene ore water electric board three nine seven million the port of seattle wash nine three million and northern wasco county ore peoples utility district four million the vast majority of those involved in the market are due refunds but only a minority are seeking refunds said one attorney in the case among a handful contacted by dow jones newswires who spoke freely on condition they not be identified weve made clear if refunds are awarded we are going to come in and demand ours as well said an attorney representing a power marketer when the agency sees that it will be clear that they have opened a can of worms that they dont want to get into with the expedited hearing concluded parties in the proceeding must file position briefs by sept one four with the administrative law judge hearing the case who is scheduled to forward her proposed findings of fact to the commission by sept two four jeff goltz an attorney with the washington state attorney generals office described the power sellers concerns about due process as misplaced power sellers were concerned that the fate of billions of dollars hinged on a proceeding lasting a few days goltz said but the proceeding actually was a vehicle to decide if ferc will proceed to a larger welldefined proceeding he said i wouldnt expect the ferc to take this and issue a refund decision goltz said attorneys representing power providers expressed the hope that ferc wont pursue refunds in the region we could get a refund said an attorney representing an investorowned utility in the region but our hope is the whole thing goes away which it should he said the whole things just too complicated i dont know how the judge is going to make a decision in this case the case represents a pandoras box for the commission said an attorney representing a municipal utility in the region opposed to refunds this case has the potential to be far bigger than the california refund case because it involves essentially the entire western united states the lawyer said if ferc pulls the strings and orders refunds it will trigger ripple refund claims involving hundreds of thousands of bilateral wholesale power sales contracts throughout the west he said where it stops nobody knows if you start trying to unravel this market for the period in question december two zero zero zero through june two zero zero one its not going to end for the foreseeable future said another attorney each successive ripple will trigger more ripples if they do its going to keep the rest of us attorneys employed for a long time he said the only beneficiaries so far in this proceeding are the attorneys said another lawyer any refunds are likely to much less than the attorney fees report la power agency made big

states power crisis the los angeles department of water and power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials previously acknowledged it was reported monday dwp officials have insisted for months that the agency sold power for just one five percent above its costs in fact the dwps profits from electricity sales to powerstarved areas of the state averaged five six percent last year according to a newly completed audit obtained by the los angeles times under the california public records act the finding will likely reinforce charges by some consumer advocates that the public power company effectively helped its customers at the expense of those suffering blackouts and rate hikes the audit may also undercut efforts by gov gray davis and others to blame rising energy costs on private outofstate generating companies the audit was ordered in may by the dwps new general manager david wiggs it was conducted by pricewaterhousecoopers and targeted a one three month period beginning in may two zero zero zero the dwp became a key player in the energy crisis last year when the states deregulation of electricity began to backfire with supply from private generators contracting and wholesale prices skyrocketing the dwp which had opted out of deregulation cranked up its generating capacity and sold the extra electricity into the california market helping to avert even more blackouts at the same time though the dwp and other publicly owned utilities charged some of the highest prices during the crisis official reports later showed records show that during the worst one three months of the crisis ending in may the dwp profited two zero zero million on sales of six eight zero million the times said the agency says it is still owed one eight zero million in an interview with the times last week former dwp chief s david freeman who now heads davis new statewide power authority insisted that he had issued standing orders to sell power at a profit of no more than one five percent freeman made the same assurance in july in a letter to us senators probing the energy meltdown he told the times he has not seen the audit but said if profits were higher than one five percent then im not embarrassed about it it says nothing more than theres enterprise at the dwp wiggs said that his staff had found no documentation as of friday to confirm the existence of a strict pricing policy during freemans tenure but he said that even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated it was not excessive we charged just and reasonable rates wiggs told the times adding that the dwp now offers the state electricity with no profit margin but for consumersrights activists the findings were new ammunition taking advantage of residents in one part of the state to benefit residents in another part is not fair said harry snyder senior advocate for consumers union the nonprofit that publishes consumer reports this kind of

residential customers will see this months natural gas bills drop on average by nearly a third from a year ago when supplies were short and market prices were zooming supplies are up and prices are down now because drillers went at it last winter trying to take advantage of high market prices after a january price spike prices have since declined nearly to the level of two winters ago said christy dennis pacific gas electric spokeswoman although there was such a shortage of natural gas last winter that there were threats of service cuts supplies for this winter should be ample she said we are in much better shape this year than we were last year dennis said the naturalgas industry reports that falling prices promise to push some drillers out of the market again but if youre talking about this winter its a sunny picture said laurie cramer spokeswoman for the natural gas supply association in washington dc production is up even if prices are down perhaps most important she added we dont expect the kind of volatile market we had last year from august one nine nine nine gas prices rose from less than three per thousand cubic feet to one one by the beginning of this and have since fallen to under two five zero dennis said that in september two zero zero zero the average pge residential natural gas customer using three zero therms of gas during a three zero day cycle paid two six one one for the natural gas portion of the gas bill this month that same three zero therms will cost one seven eight seven a nearly three two percent drop from a year ago she said the big question of course is the outlook for the heart of winter the utility isnt speculating because demand and thus supplies can be unsettled by an unusually cold winter but the gas market trend points to only a slight increase from now through the heavy cold months as naturalgas consumption rises dennis said in january residential customers use about seven zero therms of gas in january two zero zero zero the bill for that was about five zero last january averaged one two two three zero dennis said elizabeth field has both a gas stove and water heater in her stockton home and she said she was delighted to hear that her gas bill should be down from last winter my natural gas bill doubled over the winter she said between gasoline prices for the car and my pge bill it was a big deal sam baygi owner of el dorado florist one four three nine n el dorado st said that higher gas prices didnt really seem to hit him hard over the winter the important factor at his shop is to keep the flowers cool anyway and at home his gas costs seemed up maybe slightly he recalled but all in all he didnt feel pounded i dont think it was so big of a deal dennis said supplies should be sufficient for pges three seven million natural gas customers despite that many of the usual suppliers quit doing business with pge because of the utilitys bankruptcy proceedings and credit poundinge the utilitys financial woes began last summer when spotmarket spikes for electricity produced high power prices that pge had to pay to try to keep the power on in california the national naturalgas association is three weeks away from finishing its tabulation of production numbers and forecasting winter supplies but cramer said naturalgas producers still face many of the same challenges they faced last year such as a shortage of workers and equipment also some of the biggest discovered naturalgas reserves in the rocky mountains region and in the gulf of mexico remain untapped because of government restrictions theres still a lot offlimits to producers cramer said also about twothirds of drillers are small momandpop type operations that can be driven out of production by low prices she said its a

powers earnings for the year to march two zero zero two by around nine pence one three one us cents or one four six european cents a share or two five the announcement of the charge which scottish power spi said was linked to extreme volatility in us forward electricity markets knocked the companys shares in midday trading in london scottish power declined one two to four two four pence the news couldnt have come at a worse time for the beleaguered uk utility which was just beginning to recover from the effects of last years sixmonth outage at its utah hunter power plant the outage which forced scottish power to buy power on western us wholesale markets overheated by the california energy crisis contributed to four zero zero million in excesspower costs the company reported for its latest fiscal year which ended march three one in an effort to avoid exposing itself anew to unprecedented price spikes which were forecast to continue through the end of two zero zero one scottish power overcompensated in its forward contracts leading to the new three zero zero million charge the company said all we are doing is making sure pacificorp has sufficient power to meet its regulatory obligations chief executive ian russell said monday the difficult thing is that when we bought that power to meet regulatory supply obligations we were buying at a price that is over ten times what it is today a combination of lower demand more capacity price caps and coolerthanexpected summer weather have led to a collapse in us prices to around three zero per megawatthour currently from an average of more than two zero zero per megawatthour in the first quarter the company said scottish power will seek recovery of the excess charges from us regulators in the months to come mr russell said the company is also reviewing its riskmanagement policies the new charges draw a line under the episode that started last winter with this spike in prices mr russell said abn amro analyst alistair buchanan said market was shocked by the announcement and that investors will want to know why they werent warned earlier on the brighter side mr russell and chief financial officer david nish noted that the company last week won a six four four million revenue increase from regulators in the state of oregon most of which is related to increased power costs although the tariff increase was only six zero of the one zero three million the company was seeking mr nish said the company was encouraged by the regulators agreement to allow pacificorp to defer compliance with the new oregon baseline power cost in tariffs until may two zero zero two the agreement also allows pacificorp to propose a permanent powercost recovery mechanism he added the company is expecting a decision from utah regulators on a separate one zero zero million tariffincrease request in the next couple of days the oregon rate decision is a positive one for scottish power analysts said but several said it will be overshadowed by the three zero zero million charge which is far higher than the one nine zero million in excess costs some were expecting this year the most important thing is that the time at

the california independent system operator for power purchased on behalf of the states insolvent utilities dwr spokesman oscar hidalgo said friday between the middle of january when gov gray davis ordered the dwr to start paying for iso power purchases and may three one the iso has procured about three three billion in power on behalf of california s cashstrapped utilities pge corps pcg pacific gas electric co and edison internationals eix southern california edison according to the iso none of that power has been paid for according to the iso as previously reported the iso and dwr have been negotiating the procedure for settling the accounts but sellers to the iso have been complaining that it shouldnt take eight months for the state agencies to get payments flowing until we get a bill that we can account for we cant write a blank check and send it out we havent even received an improper bill said hidalgo the iso was unable to comment immediately on whether it has sent a bill to the dwr for power purchased on behalf of the utilities the iso has said previously that it cant supply all the information the dwr wants without violating its own confidentiality rules the independent energy producers association which represents many of the suppliers to the iso said this week the iso market is on the verge of collapsing merchant power companies in california such as dynegy inc dyn and mirant corp mir continue to sell to the iso as ordered by the federal energy regulatory commission the iso which has ultimate responsibility for avoiding blackouts ensures there is exactly the right amount of power on the states transmission lines to meet demand at all times which requires constant buying and selling of electricity in midjanuary after the states two main utilities ran out of cash an executive order from davis backed by state law passed in february authorized the dwr to pay for any purchases the iso needed to make for the utilities there is no bill i dont know as a government agency how the process of payment for a significant amount of money over one billion would be in anybodys mind as a possibility hidalgo said the dwr which has paid more than nine billion for power it has bought from suppliers directly since january has set aside money to pay for the isos lastminute purchases the iso considers the entire three three billion unpaid though dwr operations chief pete garris said earlier this week that dwr may have paid a majority of that bill directly to power suppliers the dwr has set aside about one two five billion to pay suppliers once it receives a detailed bill from the iso that meets dwr requirements other procedural problems have prevented the dwr from making payment the dwr wants to pay suppliers directly which garris said the iso is uncomfortable with the iso declined to discuss this directpayment issue iso market rules require that buyers pay the iso which in turn pays sellers the ferc has ordered the iso to stop buying power on

electricity prices may not be high on the list yet oddly enough this appears to be one of the main selling features of the harris governments plan to deregulate the ontario electricity market next year once electricity is deregulated the price of a kilowatt of energy will change by the minute with prices posted on the internet every hour really keen consumers who dont want to wait a whole agonizing hour can have meters installed right in their homes so for instance if the price per kilowatt hour hits rock bottom at four three six am these wellequipped folk wont have to wait until the top of the hour to shove the laundry into the washing machine turn on the dishwasher and get out the vacuum cleaner this is all part of what deregulation enthusiasts like john grant an economist who has been involved in the provincial deregulation plans see as the empowerment consumers will enjoy under deregulation well i certainly wouldnt want to underestimate the pleasure of being able to select the perfect time to maximize ones electricity consumption but will it be enough to compensate for the higher prices that will almost certainly accompany this deregulation we know deregulation produced dramatically higher electricity prices in alberta and california in alberta prices rose to five times previous levels last winter in california power costs surged at times to levels five zero zero zero above normal supporters of deregulation prefer to look at what has happened elsewhere michael trebilcock a university of toronto law professor and longtime pusher of electricity deregulation points to deregulation in australia and the uk where he says electricity prices fell by one zero to one five maybe im missing something here but it sounds like what were faced with is a bestcase scenario under which deregulation saves us possibly one zero to one five off our power bills wow the worstcase scenario however involves us paying amounts that are potentially staggering if we do things as badly as california we could see increases from time to time in the five zero zero zero range vacuuming could become not only an exclusively latenight pleasure but a luxury we can only dream of dont the odds seem to be stacked against us on this one it seems a bit like agreeing to a coin toss heads you win one zero cents tails you lose five zero but lets go for it and in case it sounds like im distorting things it should be noted that this is essentially the picture presented by advocates of deregulation trebilcock for instance doesnt argue that the savings will be big only that there may be some savings as there were in australia and the uk in a recent presentation to the institute for policy analysis in toronto trebilcock acknowledged that the adverse experiences in jurisdictions like california and alberta made him nervous but in any event he wasnt sure it was possible at this stage in ontario to put the genie back in the bottle hows that for a ringing endorsement from one of deregulations leading proponents meanwhile myron gordon a professor of finance at u of ts rotman school of management argues that the ontario deregulation will be a complete disaster not just for consumers but for the canadian business community gordon insists that surging unpredictable electricity costs will strip ontario industries of the competitive advantage theyve long enjoyed over their counterparts in neighbouring us states gordon scoffs at the notion that there might be price savings he notes that once our electricity is deregulated it will be subject to the rules of nafta under nafta we cant withhold energy supplies from us customers or charge them more than we charge ourselves so electricity shortages in the united states will push our prices here up to us levels better do the vacuuming now what makes all this infuriating is that gordon insists that if we just left things as they are with a regulated price in a regulated market we could keep our prices below the united states while covering the full cost of generating the electricity we need and having some supply left over for profitable export this is pretty much what bc has opted to do its not surprising then that deregulation aficionados are pushing things other than price savings to get the public excited about this bold venture into the new economy john grant likes to emphasize the huge array of consumer choice that lies ahead consumers will be able to choose electricity packages that also include long distance telephone and internet service theyll be free to choose between standard supply where the wholesale price of energy will be passed through to them and they may be entitled to a rebate or instead opt for whatever deal is offered by their distributor or they can choose to deal directly with a retailer who offers fixed prices for a year or more or another who will install a meter in their home so they can track minutebyminute price fluctuations not that life will be problemfree in this consumer nirvana grant poses the question if consumers sign up to a retailers fixed price offer and sign away their right to a possible rebate do they know what they have

for edison fails tests again william bradley zero nine one zero two zero zero one los angeles times home edition page bone one copyright two zero zero one the times mirror company at a late night session thursday the california assembly emulated its deregulation forebears narrowly adopting another complex halfunderstood energy bill from the back rooms there are many problems with the proposed state bailout of southern california edison here are the most fundamental the bailout is much bigger than advertised backers including gov gray davis parent company edison international and some los angeles progressives advertise it as a two nine billion deal in reality when interest on bonds and other benefits are added in it will cost closer to twice as much tangible assets for the public once central to the deal have been stripped from it the edison rescue was to center on the states acquisition of the utilitys transmission lines ownership of the grid would have given the state leverage it has lacked over power generators and state ownership would make critically needed upgrades cheaper to finance this fell away when pacific gas electric declared bankruptcy this spring taking a huge chunk of the private grid off the market while some sierra lands receive protection from development the state gains no ownership coastal and desert lands are unprotected edison already has received three state bailouts first it along with the other big private utilities received billions in a bailout of stranded assets most notably nuclear that was part of the one nine nine six deregulation deal it received billions more as part of the abovemarket consumer rates locked in by the deregulation dealuntil companies that bought the power plants edison cleverly sold them turned the screws last year these funds enabled edison international to run a highflying global merchant power operation then edison received a third bailout earlier this year when the state spent one billion to replace power lost from the troubled san onofre nuclear plant edison is hypocritical in coming to the capitol with its hand out yet again especially given its central role in pushing through the deregulation scheme from which it now wants to be rescued edison international ceo john e bryson trades on his past progressive status as a natural resources defense council cofounder to distract from reality when gov pete wilson signed deregulation into law bryson called it a great day for us yet even with the billions edison has gotten in previous bailouts a state rescue effort might be justified were the process not so remarkably compromised davis sent michael r peevey a former southern california edison president to represent the state in negotiations with edison not surprisingly this led to a generous deal for the company with the state negotiating for things that the state public utilities commission could have required the company to do anyway although that deal died what is now on the table is fatally flawed by the sweetheart deal template from which it sprang so eager is davis to bail out edison that he would allow big business customers to cut their own private power contracts this could leave the rest of us holding the bag on his hugely expensive longterm power contracts perhaps worst of all is the tremendous distraction caused by the months of maneuvering to save edison from its own miscalculations as we emerge from panic mode california has serious problems including a new crazyquilt of state energy agencies and longterm power contracts that perpetrate a green blackout ignoring renewable energy in favor of a new generation of fossil fuel plants the situation would have been far more rational and efficient had everyone involved not had to waste inordinate amounts of time dealing with the special pleadings of one privileged corporation enough pge disputes cost shift the agency that buys state utilities electricity had asked regulators to approve uniform rates but plan is under review mike taugher times staff writer zero nine zero six two zero zero one contra costa times walnut creek ca final page azero one c copyright two zero zero one contra costa times all rights reserved san francisco a plan to shift six zero zero million in electricity costs from southern california to pacific gas electric co came under heavy fire wednesday when the san franciscobased utility launched a media campaign to oppose the plan and northern california lawmakers blasted it as potentially illegal even if it costs the state more to buy power in the north it is doubtful that the differences are enough to justify such a large transfer of costs according to a letter signed by three zero of the three one northern california members of the assembly at issue is how the state department of water resources which has been buying electricity for financially strapped utilities since january will be repaid for its electricity purchases this year and next the agency had asked state regulators to approve a uniform price tag of one one four cents for each kilowatthour it sells to utility customers but under the plan now being considered by the public utilities commission pge customers would pay one four cents per kilowatthour through next may while customers of southern california edison and san diego gas electric would pay one zero cents and nine cents respectively this appears to be an unsubstantiated and illegal cost shift to northern california customers lawmakers wrote in a letter sent wednesday to puc president loretta lynch the puc had planned to consider the issue today but it is among several items that have been delayed for as long as two weeks as the commission struggles to issue regulations needed to allow the state to borrow more than one two billion on the bond market lynch said linking the price of electricity to the actual cost to the state of providing it instead of spreading out the toll that the electricity crisis has exacted on california equally is consistent with the way the commission has traditionally imposed rates that is the methodology the commission has used for decades lynch said it would be discriminatory to have edison customers and sdge customers subsidize pge customers still assemblyman joe canciamilla dpittsburg said that unless the plan is modified northern california lawmakers might block legislation designed to keep socal edison out of bankruptcy that legislation which could come to the assembly floor as early as today has been a key part of gov gray davis strategy to navigate california out of the electricity crisis i dont know how anyone in the north is going to be able to justify voting for a bailout for edison that shifts any of these costs onto pge customers directly or indirectly canciamilla said according to canciamilla relieving socal edison of hundreds of millions of costs for statepurchased power could help the southern california utility finance one billion in debts to generators which in turn would help make the bailout plan work i dont think the real motivation is retribution against pge for defying davis by declaring voluntary bankruptcy in april as much as it is trying to figure out a way to assist in making a bailout of socal edison work canciamilla said meanwhile pge took out radio spots and ads in three newspapers wednesday urging customers to complain to the puc about the plan the commission substantially changed the formula and as a result our customers would be forced to pay more said pge spokesman ron low that claim is mostly true but potentially misleading pges customers would pay more for the electricity purchased by the state but whether that would lead to a higher overall electricity bill is not clear that is because the puc has yet to determine how much pge should earn on electricity generated at the plants it still owns if pge is allowed to earn relatively little then no rate increase would be needed but if the sum of the rate collected by dwr and the rate collected by pge exceeds what customers are paying now then another rate hike could occur the pucs lynch who assured reporters this spring that no rate hikes would be needed after the commission approved increases totaling four cents per kilowatthour this year was noncommittal wednesday about the possibility of a further increase for pge customers paul clanon head of the pucs energy division said the likelihood of a rate increase for pge customers would become clearer near the end of the month when drafts begin circulating to address the rate that pge may collect puc officials did say however that no rate hike would hit customers of southern california utilities state officials say it costs far more to provide power in the north because the state has to buy more electricity to serve northern california and there is comparatively less electricity available in the northern part of state and in the pacific northwest that pinch between supply and demand is exacerbated by transmission constraints that make it more difficult to bring electricity up from southern california according to dwr spokesman oscar hidalgo the state supplies about four zero percent of the electricity used by pge customers with the rest being generated at pge plants or under existing contracts especially with alternative energy generators california official seeks

optimism friday that a two nine billion plan to try to restore southern california edison to financial health will reach his desk before next friday when legislators adjourn for the year a day after the state assembly narrowly approved the measure the democratic governor said that although it still needs to be reconciled with a slightly different version approved earlier by the senate he is confident the bill will clear the legislature im hopeful that we get the rescue plan ratified by a week from today the last day of the session davis said friday during a breakfast meeting in sacramento i think thats entirely doable now since its passed both houses albeit in different forms our goal will be to get that done before the legislature recesses davis optimism contrasted with angry words from consumer activists who oppose the bill as a bailout of edison is this the best deal the assembly can get from a company that claims to be desperately in need of help said mike florio senior attorney for the utility reform network in san francisco it reads as if the same scoundrels that led the legislature into deregulationthe utilities and the large commercial customersare still running the show edison executives offered a subdued response during a conference call with investors friday maintaining that the road to restoring the companys finances in the capitol remains long this is another step in the trail said theodore craver jr chief financial officer of edison international parent company of the rosemeadbased utility we obviously have a long way to go yet in terms of additional steps at the senate but its good to see some momentum there the bill sb seven eight xx by sen richard polanco dlos angeles is a slimmeddown version of a rescue deal davis reached with the debtstrapped utility this spring to keep it out of bankruptcy it has cleared both houses but still needs final approval in the senate where senate president pro tem john burton dsan francisco plans to take several days to review the changes made in the assembly to determine whether the measure is viable in many ways the two versions are alike both would allow the utility to float bonds that would be used to repay about threefourths of the three nine billion debt edison incurred purchasing electricity during the early days of the energy crisis edison bought the power on the volatile open market for far more than it could charge its customers under a stateimposed rate freeze edison would be permitted to use the money to pay back most of its creditorsbanks and small alternative energy producers both bills would bar edison from using the money to repay large energy companies which democratic legislators accuse of gouging the state during the crisis the utility would be on its own to pay or negotiate the one billion it owes those companies under the assembly version the bonds would be paid off by about one eight zero zero zero zero of edisons large and midsized business customers those that use two zero kilowatts and up under the senate version a smaller number of the largest businesses would foot the tab under both bills residential customers and most small businesses would be spared supporters of the bill say that neither version would require an additional increase in electricity bills opponents question that assertion because the company would still have sizable debts even if the bill passes edison representatives say they cannot guarantee they will not wind up in bankruptcy robert foster edison internationals executive vice president of external affairs told investors friday that the bill still leaves southern california edison at risk nevertheless we are encouraged by the progress made by the assembly toward creating a workable framework to get the state out of the power procurement business and restore southern california edison to creditworthiness foster said in both plans edison would also agree not to pursue a series of lawsuits and legal claims against the state pacific gas electric the states largest utility has filed suit against the state charging that the rate freeze illegally prohibited the company from recovering its costs of providing power to customers both bills also would give the state conservation rights to two zero zero zero zero acres of mostly wilderness land near edisons hydroelectric power reservoirs the original rescue deal from last spring hinged on the state purchasing edisons power grid some legislators and consumer activists said the grid could be upgraded with public financing to improve the distribution of power and prevent the likelihood of blackouts but legislators have questioned the value of owning a third of the states power linesthe share controlled by edisonand the bills minimize the grid acquisition under the senate plan the state would have an option to purchase the lines at one two billion or book value less than half what davis initially proposed the assembly plan would give the state a similar option requiring further action by the legislature before it could be exercised the assembly bill would pay the utility twice book value or fair market price whichever was lower the assembly and senate versions contain provisions that would allow businesses to pursue direct access contracts to buy electricity from energy companies instead of from the utility participating businesses would have to pay an exit fee of sorts to cover their share of the utilitys debt bonds power politics in the senate zero nine one zero two zero zero one the new york times page two eight column one c two zero zero one new york times company this has not been a good year for clear thinking about energy first came the cheneybush national energy strategy which presupposed that the country was in the grips of a terrible energy shortage and that the only sure way to address it was to drill aggressively for more oil and gas remove various regulatory impediments to the burning of coal and build one three zero zero new power plants the house of representatives swallowed the cheneybush scenario whole and produced an alarmingly unbalanced energy bill with three three billion in tax breaks two seven billion for traditional energy producers only six billion for conservation the senate must now set things right presumably at lower cost even the bush administration was appalled by the houses price tag what this country wants is an energy policy that encourages oil and gas exploration without corrupting the environment finds more efficient ways to use the energy we have and begins planning for the day when the fossil fuels we take for granted are less abundant at home or abroad this will not be an easy task energy politics gets nasty and local in a hurry in the house for example many normally reliable friends of the environment voted in favor of opening the arctic national wildlife refuge to the oil companies and against increasing fuel economy standards because they were terrified of retaliation from organized labor if they did otherwise this is a rare chance for the senate to exercise statesmanship while reaping political rewards as well polls show that the two issues on which president bush is most vulnerable are energy and the environment the senate cannot lose if it produces a plan more balanced and enlightened than his it will be up to jeff bingaman the chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee to devise such a plan then tom daschle the senate majority leader must sell it to his colleagues there are three areas where the house bill requires complete overhaul improving efficiency the house bill dedicates five nine billion in various subsidies for energy efficiency and renewable energy versus about two seven billion for the coal oil and gas industries it creates modest tax credits for people who buy hybrid cars for builders of more energyefficient homes and for manufacturers of some energysaving appliances but it does nothing to improve the efficiency of one of the biggest energy users of all airconditioners and it is here that the senate could usefully resurrect the tough standards imposed by the clinton administration that president bush is trying to roll back the most important and courageous step however and one the house refused to take would be to close the socalled suv loophole under which large vehicles like sport utility vehicles and minivans are classified as light trucks and thus escape the two seven five milepergallon standard required of ordinary cars closing that loophole which detroit is perfectly capable of doing would result in oil savings of one million barrels a day by two zero one five more than the arctic national wildlife refuge could be expected to yield in the same time frame increasing supply at the heart of the house bill is a proposal to open up the refuges coastal plain to oil exploration that would yield only six months to a years worth of oil even at favorable prices while disrupting an ecological treasure industry assertions that drilling would create seven five zero zero zero zero new jobs have been widely discredited there are other steps the committee can take to increase supply one is to see whether there is an environmentally safe way of tapping and transporting the vast supplies of natural gas at alaskas prudhoe bay where the oil industry is already firmly ensconced such a scheme would be expensive and in some quarters controversial but it makes a lot more sense than invading the refuge the national forests the rocky mountain front and other sensitive areas on which the oil industry and the cheney task force have cast a covetous eye improving reliability the house was so fixated on subsidizing traditional energy producers including the coalfired utilities that it paid no attention to the way electricity is regulated and transported that was a huge oversight that mr bingaman says he intends to remedy as the nowreceding california crisis demonstrated electricity deregulation has not gone smoothly there are transmission problems in the west and northeast power does not move easily from one region to another and the system is full of disincentives that discourage smaller and potentially more efficient producers of power from entering the market none of this will come easy for mr bingaman and mr daschle they must resist president bushs seductive and specious argument that opening up new areas for oil and gas drilling and easing environmental regulations will provide an immediate economic boost and powerful corporate

from a simple natural gas pipeline company into the worlds largest trader of electricity and gas last year about threequarters of the companys cash flow came out of the companys wholesale services division which includes its trading operations but enron keeps to itself the details of the trades it makes are they shortterm or longterm is the company hedged or does it make directional bets on the prices of the commodities it trades the answers are crucial because they determine how much risk enron has taken to make its money big profits are nice big profits that come from big risky trades are a recipe for big unexpected writeoffs enron also makes a habit of selling assets and securities to closely related companies in related party transactions the company says that the deals are comparable to those it makes with independent buyers and that they have been approved by its board and outside auditors but relatedparty deals can provide a convenient way for public companies to shift losses to private affiliates and enrons disclosure about its relatedparty deals including billions of dollars in asset swaps with a partnership that until recently was controlled by the companys chief financial officer is notably sketchy in the good old days like last year companies could get away with the unlikeliest of accounting gimmicks as long as their revenue and profit numbers looked good but wall street has become more demanding as enron is learning to its chagrin mark palmer a spokesman for enron says the company is aware of investors concerns weve got credibility issues on the street no question mr palmer says were looking at a lot of ways to give our investors more information sooner would be better than later,10:00:04,No

cc winter terry subject re important letter to governor davis ab one eight nine zero group a response to the isos recent message regarding cmuas proposed language is necessary first cmua proposed its language to the group on participation of municipal system units during the week of august two one st and discussed the matter at length with the group when iso representatives were in attendance and commenting on various drafting suggestions any implication that there is an element of surprise associated with the cmua language is unfounded if anything it is the isos latest suggestion to remove the language that is tardy the letter underwent several iterative changes during which time the iso had an opportunity to make constructive suggestions to modify the language preferably or at a minimum explain its position so that the group could consider the issue second the iso indicates that there is ongoing and longstanding litigation over how to bring munis into the iso system as a reason for not including the language in the proposed letter certainly the fact that an issue is being litigated is not a distinguishing characteristic what issue hasnt been litigated including load participation in iso ancillary service markets as we fully discussed with the group there are a host of issues associated with municipaliso discussions including iso cost allocation to load cmuas specific proposal is to uncouple issues of transmission and load cost allocation from the issue of getting generation capacity into the markets it is unfortunate that when we all recognize that we need more capacity in the iso markets to deepen supply the iso is taking a position to hold on to chits in an effort to strengthen its hand on transmission and load cost allocation issues the end result is that generation is not in the iso markets whatever the exact number it is far in excess of several of the other recommendations made in the letter because the issue is being held hostage for negotiating purposes on issues that have nothing to do with supply at this point it appears we will not have agreement on this matter in the past the group has acted as a consensus organization cmua

dinkel tom tim schmelzer email tommy ross tony braun victoria schaefer email cc winter terry subject re important letter to governor davis i do not have a comment on karens edit but i wanted to email the entire group about cmuas insistence on keeping proposal eight under the generation section this is the section referencing potential muni units that could be bid into the iso as market if we can figure out a way to avoid having them join formally i had mentioned when this was first brought upwhich was frankly rather late in the drafting gamethat i thought this would be very controversial at iso not only does iso not concur with the notion that there would be over one zero zero zero mw of addiitonal supply into as markets but placing this language in a letter to the governor makes it look like iso is the obstacle to having these units available there is ongoing and longstanding litigation over how to bring munis into the iso system i am not uncomfortable with discussing this issue at any ab one eight nine zero meeting but forcing the issue in this governors letter is not placing the issue on a level playing field in my opinion if cmua decides not to sign the letter without this controversial piece that will be unfortunate original message from karen edson mailtokedsonnsnet sent thursday september one four two zero zero zero one one nine pm to dhuntersmithandkemptoncom aaron

a redlined version is attached i hope this is helpful one we propose to eliminate one proposed solution that is part of ab nine seven zero our edits move to the description of ab nine seven zero the recommendation for allowing plants expected to come on line in two or three years to come on line earlier as single cycle facilities from the list of solutions two we propose to move the proposal to expedite renewable generation to a comment that signing ab nine nine five sb one one nine four will expedite more than five zero zero mw of new renewable generation by next summer this number is based on a cec letter three we propose to consolidate solutions four and five since both involve changes or additions to existing plants four finally we propose to modify the description of the cecs
