subject article sent from the hindu an interesting article could it happen this article is emailed to you by tushar s dhruv tushardhruvenroncom source the hindu httpwwwhinduonnetcom dabhol and the do nothing government by prem shankar jha ever since the vajpayees government came to power more than two and a half years ago the economy has been sliding relentlessly into the deepest recession it has ever known in the nine months since december industrial growth has averaged one seven per cent the decade when it averaged nine per cent and the months only five years ago when it touched one six two per cent are now but a distant memory consumer demand was utterly flat before the september one one terrorist strikes in the us it has now shrunk dramatically vehicle sales dropped by two zero percent in september and colour tv sets registered a growth of a measly three to four per cent with no demand to power it inflation measured by the consumer price index has fallen almost to zero the share market is dead and there is no fresh investment employment in the organised sector is shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in human memory in the past three years two million new job seekers have tried to find a place however humble in the organised sector of the economy but been turned away by two zero zero four the number will have risen by another three million but mr yashwant sinha is confident that a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all of the countrys problems but one recent event highlights the governments paralysis more sharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do this is its failure to react to the defeat in a london consumer court of the maharashtra state electricity boardss attempt to foil enrons bid to take it before an international arbitration court by claiming that a case was pending before an indian court challenging the arbitration clause in the power purchase agreement the london court correctly maintained that just as a governments international obligations as defined by the treaty or the agreement supercede its obligations under domestic law proceedings in an international court must take precedence over those in a domestic court the way has therefore been cleared for india to face the humiliation of being dragged before an international tribunal for a breach of it contractual obligations given the fearsome proficiency of enrons lawyers both those whom they retain and those who drafted the power purchase agreement it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the mseb will lose the case if that happens then by a conservative estimate india will have to pay around five billion in costs and damages in addition it will have to spend a little more to complete phase ii of the project thus in the end the project is likely to cost not three billion but more like five two to five four billion for much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute has dragged on the centre played ostrich and pretended that this was simply a dispute between a state government and a private company and it had no say in the matter that pretext in any case wore thin when new delhi refused to honour its counter guarantee after the mseb stopped paying its monthly dues but today it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was because neither the mseb nor the maharashtra government is even capable let alone willing to pay such an enormous penalty so the bill will inevitably land at the centres door and that means the taxpayers door the centre will have no option but to pay but having done so will it then gift the project to the maharashtra government the answer obviously is no what it will be forced to do is transfer it to the national thermal power corporation to complete and operate but since no one can possibly run a five billion power plant generating two one zero zero mw of power profitably the ntpc too will insist on the capital value of the project being substantially written down first judging from the offers that the tata electric company and the bombay suburban electricity supply company bses were making to enron the written down value will not exceed two billion thus whichever way we look at it the country will end by paying for a dabholsize power plant three billion without getting a single watt of electricity or for that matter anything else in return none of the above criticism is intended to deny that enron probably did gold plate the dabhol project once the narasimha rao government agreed to price its power on a costplus basis nor is it intended to mitigate the criticism of the rao government that had it only brought the maharashtra government and more particularly the mseb into the negotiations from the beginning the latters inability under law to pay backup charges at more than twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plants would have been exposed long ago but the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justify even greater mistakes in the future for better or for worse the enron deal was struck and it was struck not once but twice as a serious responsible government that knows the importance of honouring ones word in a world where contract is king the vajpayee government must honour the countrys contractual obligations this does not in any way preclude its trying to alter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did not see but by definition all future changes must be by mutual consent the changes that enron will accept and will make dabhols power affordable are known to all as the one nine nine five renegotiating committee and the godbole committee recommended the government should buy the eight zero zero million lng regasification plant and turn it into a separate company that can supply gas to all the current and future users on the west coast in fact it could go one better and bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and manage the plant this is entirely feasible because its installed capacity is more than twice what dabhol is likely to need this will bring down the capital cost upon which backup charges and cost per unit of power will be calculated to two two billion second the central government should buy three zero per cent of the equity in dabhol from the promoters this was negotiated with the one nine nine five committee but the mseb could not raise the funds to do so this will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreign exchange to one nine billion and the debt portion whose servicing represents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to one two billion the centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairman of bses to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupee debt that will reduce further the vulnerability of electricity tariffs to changes in the exchange rate with the price of oil having fallen for india to around two zero a barrel these changes will bring down the cost of dabhols power at nine zero per cent capacity utilisation own to below rs two four zero a unit this will make it entirely viable especially if maharashtra and the neighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in the average power tariff or are able to bring down power theft and reduce subsidies to the pseudorural sector the right course for the centre even at this late stage will be to take over the project from the mseb renegotiate it with enron or if enron wants to opt out then buy the project from it at cost and make the above structural changes on its own before handing it over to the ntpc getting dragged to court will neither solve the problem of paying for dabhols power nor answer the more basic question how can any electricity grid add new power plants to itself without raising the average tariff it charges for electricity copyrights one

businesses that youve worked so hard to build following are the major components of the transaction deal terms the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of zero two six eight five dynegy shares for every enron share for example each one zero zero zero shares of enron stock will be converted to two six eight shares of dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing chevrontexaco owns approximately two six percent of dynegys outstanding common stock chevrontexaco will invest one five billion in dynegy immediately and an additional one billion in dynegy on closing of the merger dynegy will immediately invest one five billion in cash in enrons northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately seven zero zero million shares the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year enron will have immediate access to dynegys one five billion cash investment in enrons northern natural gas subsidiary management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company which will be called dynegy inc and steve bergstrom will be president and coo i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration the makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter two zero zero two this merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers as with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible as i said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history we considered several options but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild

declining partly out of frustration with the slow progress being made i think however that we ought to think about the potential consequences of recommending a standard model if we simply endorse pjm then we may inadvertently get its warts as well no secondary transmission market icap market etc i think we are considering the same thing approach as was reported by charles yeungs in his note on tuesdays interrto coordination seams conference harvey reed constellation power suggested that ferc impose a standard tariff for all rtos to work from that did not restrict rtos from filing different proposals but would limit their ability to diverge from a single market model in addition to the standard model there needs to be a deadline for either filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff without a feet to the fire feature nothing the grand stall will continue in arguing for a standard model the pjm system could be the core of a proposal but we should specific modifications to address our concerns on the transmission rights issue for instance a simple dont allocate solution wont work the lack of the secondary market for ny tccs or pjm ftrs goes both to the lack of information and to the way the rights are defined if as harvey reed suggests rtos can submit alternative approaches at least there will be pressure to get moving i have not discussed this idea with west power it then occurred to me that ferc is unlikely to impose a standard tariff without a rulemaking proceeding whether they could act by fiat or not is a moot point since i doubt that they would do so without creating a record there are two possible down sides to a rule making one the outcome of a rulemaking is something of a crap shoot the incumbents have a pretty good record in the past of coming out of rulemakings with plenty of goodies such as the native load exemption in order no eight eight eight there is a also a distinct risk that pjms icap or transmission right allocation process is given blessed status which will make revision of them later to be a huge uphill battle two the other consequence of a rulemaking its effect on current rto discussions the best outcome is that the uncertainty of the rulemaking creates an urgency to get a proposal filed before a new ferc rule cuts off options from a new the standard for review the uncertainty prior to the issuance of order no eight eight eight in fact had that effect in the west on the other hand it can mean that nothing happens until the new rule is issued this also happened prior to order no eight eight eight with a number of companies sitting on their hands using the time delay to protect existing positions while whipping up state regulators fears of jurisdictional shift as necessary to boost their own position these are only own views i have not had a chance to speak with west power this week but i will approach tim when i am in portland again next week steve christi l nicolay zero six one nine two zero

points can we focus the pjm language as an interim fix toward the east while maybe the threat of pjm in the west will make the west rtos act quickly and adopt everything that steve w has been advocating also i agree with the iso being required to provide much greater information on where the congestion occurs while the allocation of ftrs is a problem and the idiosyncratic nature is also a problem it is because the traders do not have access to all the information they have told me that if they had access to all the information about congestion from the past several years they could essentially build a model for anticipated congestion that could trade above the underlying ftrs as financial instruments steve walton zero six one eight two zero zero one zero three three zero pm to james d steffesnaenronenron cc christi l nicolayhouectect richard shapironaenronenron sarah novoselcorpenronenron steven j keannaenronenron subject re interim model talking points jim i have added my comments to your draft my concern with the adopt pjm approach is that it will become a fiat accompli with regard to congestion management and the nature of future transmission rights once adopted as the standard nothing else will be accepted and any move to a decentralized approach is highly unlikely unlike the british we have a hard time changing horses because of our multijurisdictional federal system of government the pjms lack of a secondary ftr market is more that just an allocation problem if that were true they new york would have a secondary market none exists there either the unpredictability of prices is probably the biggest problem since no one knows how to value ftrs or tccs i think the nature of instrument is also not particularly helpful during our discussion of seabron adamsons last draft i maintained that a centralized unit commitment process didnt fit the pacific northwest pnw with its pattern of trading to achieve coordination between hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation you asked me to provide more detail hydrothermal operation i am including a paper that covers the nature of pnw operations and contracting with observations about the nature of unit commitment given other work and travel it has taken some time to complete the paper and its examples i hope this will help to explain why i am hesitant to endorse a centralize unit commitment

mdyslaterconsultingcom writes to the nyiso_tech_exchange discussion list your discussion is based on a misunderstanding the one five zero price is the lowest point at which the amp will check for whether there needs to be any mitigation this price was picked to avoid the amp running when it is highly unlikely that any mitigation will in fact be needed the one five zero price will not trigger mitigation in and of its whenever one of the zones has a price that is above one five zero the amp will run to determine if any units have crossed the conduct threshold if there are any units that have crossed the conduct threshold then those units will be set at their reference bids and the market will be rerun to determine if the impact threshold has been triggered if the impact threshold is triggered in any zone then the final runs will be done with the mitigated ie reference bids for those units that triggered the conduct threshold if the impact threshold is not triggered then the original bids for all units will be used original message from ownernyiso_tech_exchangelistsone thebiznet mailtoownernyiso_tech_exchangelistsone thebiznet on behalf of kirkpatrick joe sent saturday april two eight two zero zero one nine zero three am to nyiso_tech_exchangeglobaltwo zero zero zero net cc market_relationsnyisocom subject automatic mitigation kirkpatrick joe joekirkpatricknrgenergycom writes to the nyiso_tech_exchange discussion list the nyiso has chosen one five zero as representative of a level to trigger market mitigation i believe the basis for this was a determination of a price that was calculated to be representative of the statewide price of five zero a three zero zero increase or an increase of one zero zero is one five zero coincidently the same price i am questioning the determination of this price five zero and its application in the market mitigation plan in determining market power according to the market mitigation plan specific generator or unit bids are examined to identify economic withholding how does the five zero price reference a specific unit i am not sure where in the market mitigation plan it says to examine the entire statewide price and then compare it to a generators bid if a generators fuel costs without fixed cost recovery is one five zero that unit would presumably never bid below its cost it would always bid as a minimum one five zero how could that generator exceed the thresholds identified in the market mitigation plan a three zero zero increase would be four five zero and an increase of one zero zero would be two five zero and yet using the amp interpretation of the mitigation plan the threshold for identifying economic withholding is one five zero it would seem that the amp methodology is improperly applying the market mitigation plan the mitigation plan is supposed to identify generator conduct and clearly in the application of the amp it is not the simple question would be is the one five zero threshold representative of every generators bid to determine economic withholding the answer can only be no how can it be the market mitigation plan was intended to determine whether a generator was exercising market power the determination of whether a generator was exercising market power would and should take into consideration all of the prevalent market unit and system conditions to determine if that unit was in fact exercising market power the more complex the system the more complex the analysis of whether marker power was exercised how does a price trigger or any automatic threshold take all of the complexities of a situation into account it cannot i suspect that is why due process is required whether it is a court case or a market power determination the full facts are presented and evaluated every case is unique and requires deliberation and analysis of every supporting fact in other words automatic judgement is not an option and yet under the nyiso amp it is offered as a solution i do agree that prices should not be posted in the dam if they are high as a result of market power a better solution would be to delay the prices or hold them in reserve until a proper determination is made in the same way that prices are held in reserve for software flaws they should be held in reserve for determination of market power prices can be posted and flagged subject to change pending review of market power at least then due process can be followed market participants can be consulted in accordance with the plan and if required scuc can be rerun external proxy bus prices may need to be frozen to ensure that flows are consistent with the orginal dam posting if a longer period of time is required for market power evaluation the amp is still in place but is only used to identify potential market power until a human evaluation is done joe kirkpatrick,02:20:00,No

wish to liquidate stocks with special margin requirements can be found on our helpdesk under your portfolio and margin maintenance or by using the following link httpwwwdatekcomhelpdeskmarginhtml two

this must be done by the close of november one three day three in order for the call to end intraday market fluctuation will not suffice in meeting your margin call please do not assume your call will be satisfied because stocks in your portfolio are bound to go up all stocks are subject to market volatility there are no guarantees that a stock price will rise or assurances that a stock will not decline furthermore your stocks could decline further creating an even larger margin call once again do not bank on market fluctuation consider all factors including your risk tolerance to take a realistic view of how to handle the margin call account equity and additional house calls depending on the securities you are holding in your portfolio and their market fluctuations additional funds may be due or actions that are separate from this margin call may be required this may result in a second house call the key is to understand the equity requirements and ensure that your account is meeting them we may request additional margin maintenance due to a further decline in the market value of your positions at that time you may meet a margin call only to be issued a second one because the equity in the account has declined below a point where the initial margin call no longer brings the account to the acceptable equity level in these instances meeting the initial call may give you additional time to meet the second call but the account must be returned to the required equity ratio any undue concentration of one security in your account needless to say selling out an account is something we dont like to do at datek online we want you to be aware of the status of your margin account at all times and be prepared to take action as soon as conditions warrant be fully aware that if at any time your account value falls to approximately one zero equity or if market conditions warrant we reserve the right to close out some or all of your positions with or without notice at our

awordaday and other interesting tidbits about words and languages from hans feuss hansfeusscibccom subject re awordadayaufklarung i am now five four years of age but during my youth the word aufklaerung note the umlaut here had a very specific meaning having received aufklaerung or having been aufgeklaert always meant that your parentselders etc have told you not necessarily taught you the ways of the birds and bees and how babies were made i suppose this is a form of enlightenment but not necessarily in the way it was presented also noted by pamela matsudadunn pmdartaolcom and raul cucalon cucalonrpomemhone armymil from quincy liu liuhmide subject anschluss before the word anschluss became encrusted with the political overtone of being taken over it had and still has the straight forward meaning of having connection to eg by knowing a certain contact person one has the anschluss to an organization or a group from eric wilson cerebrumconsultinghomecom subject succinct definition of kitsch some years back on a bbc radio program called my work i heard the most succinct definition of kitsch kitsch a venus de milo statue with a clock its belly says it all dont you agree from randall gray randallgraymarinecsiroau subject awordadaykitsch we were discussing what someone ought to wear to a moderately formal function when a voice from the rabble piped up remember kitsch never goes out of style it is now on the wall in our loo along with a motley collection of other similar aphorisms both humourous and wise from gretta small grettasmallcscom subject spelling why have you chosen to omit the umlaut in gemutlichkeit your spelling rather than to observe the convention using an e following the oughttobe umlauted character to indicate the umlaut normally observed when the umlauted character is not available on the keyboard this is done even in germany thus the word would be spelled gemuetlichkeit the umlauted u has a completely different pronunciation from the nonumlauted u and thus is absolutely essential i lived in germany for many years and learned this the hard way eg schwuel with the umlaut means humid and schwul means homosexual from rudolph chelminski rudychelminskicompuservecom subject re german words i have received a multitude of complaints that the german words i selected for awad as a guest wordsmith were missing umlauts and were not capitalized as is standard german practice for nouns two explanations for this one many most american keyboards mine included do not have the umlaut symbol and two once german or hindi or afghan or whatever words have been kidnapped into our language they are no longer one zero zero what they were now that we have them in captivity they have to play by our rules hehhehheh so no accents umlauts diacritical marks or whatever and no capitalizations from mark willis mwillishelixnihgov subject fifteen minutes of fame for chad ive been enjoying your awad mailings for over a year now and every once in awhile i see in print a word i had recently learned from the daily morsels you send but i doubt if any newlylearned word so far has appeared as prominently to me as the term chad awad one one three nine nine for the past six days the election of the president in the united states has been literally and figuratively hinging on the chads attached in various conditions to the manuallypunched ballots in the state of florida as election officials examine them for hints of the voters electoral intent when i originally saw chad on your list i wondered why we needed a name for such an item now i realize that every word will have its fifteen minutes of fame whenever i see or hear the word which the news media often stop to define before proceeding with the story i think of awad thank you for doing your part to inform our electoral process here in the united states for those who missed it first time around the word chad is available at httpwordsmithorgwordschadhtml if you wish to see the theme under which it appeared and the entire weeks words check out the archives for nov one nine nine nine at httpwordsmithorgawadarchiveshtml anu from brian west brianwestclaranet subject slang i have with much interest read the correspondence on english rhyming slang this reminds me of an alternative slang used on occasion by my late father and allegedly by butchers in england where words were reversed thus eson was nose ecaf esaf was face and so forth quite difficult to understand until acquainted with the rules from suzy suzyeight zero seven qaolcom subject speaking backwards since most people who subscribe to awad are linguaphiles i would expect that many have a facility with languages in general im wondering how common the ability to speak backwards is for example one could instantly translate while speaking hello my name is john into olleh ym eman si nhoj i can do it and ive only met one other person who could do it as well is this a fairly common

in addition members of the committee will hold hearings around the state to assess the impact of this crisis in every region of california i applaud the speakers decision to form a special committee to address the energy crisis said minority leader campbell rvilla park he has indicated a desire to make the committee bipartisan and republicans look forward to working cooperatively to resolve the significant energy crisis that california faces aside from shaping the states energy policy during the special session the assembly committee on energy costs and availability will hold public hearings across the state seeking comment from ratepayers smallbusiness owners and consumers on how the energy crunch is affecting them this committees first priority regarding the setting of rates for electric power will be price stability said assemblymember roderick d wright dsouth central los angeles who speaker hertzberg named as chairman of the assembly committee on energy costs and availability this deregulation experiment has been risky and expensive and has put the economic wellbeing of this state in jeopardy the committee will work with the staff of the speakers office of oversight to determine how utility companies have spent the money they received for their stranded costs and what generators have done with their dramatic influx of cash the public has a right to know where that money has gone said assemblymember darrell steinburg we will conduct a thorough investigation to determine just that the speaker noted that david wiggs who helped restructure the los angeles department of water and power in one nine nine seven has been retained as an advisor to the committee wiggs will help the committee sort through market reforms and oversight of past utility spending wiggs is a retired chairman of el paso electric co and an experienced advisor for issues related to the electric utility industry he is largely credited for leading el paso electric through a multiyear bankruptcy proceeding there is no doubt that the states consumers are faced with the most serious energy crisis in decades said assembly speaker pro tem fred keeley d boulder creek we are focused on market reforms demand responsiveness measures and measures to stabilize the energy supplies consumers will only genuinely be protected from increasing energy prices when substantive reforms of the market place are adopted and take hold specifically we must through legislative and regulatory actions reform the way electricity is bought and sold and the way we contract for power on a

six pm to rorschach reagan kroll heather fairley david may tom subject open items for mdea fairley david here are issues which im unclear about all of which impact the drafting of the agreement how are we setting the heat rate do we have the gads is it a daily average weekly average flat rate adjusted if so how often fairley david each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate exhibit and the stack model as conditions change the utilities must update this info we are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage services and orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry it can never be exact but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability no gads heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions fairley david yes their units are too small we have discussed this with the customer and with our internal air permit guys rorschach reagan they have title v permits and they are faxing them to us today they have no run hour limitations on gas however they are limited on oil will need to get that summary to kay as soon as possible we have determined that we wont deal with fuel oil right fairley david we wont buy and sell fuel oil we may dispatch on oil at startup or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable which constitutes a product transaction with the resulting profit split rorschach reagan we need to state that mdea and cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies we arent making money on gas right fairley david we make money on gas two ways the first is outside the contract and is basicly any internal profit on resale of gas to the cities the second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a product trade and those procedures apply do we have a defn of costs that we like yet and if so how does it fit in to the picture fairley david yes will send separately is there an uptodate set of exhibits fairley david the marketing strategy the trading and risk policy and the description of asset management have been upated the other exhibits have not been modified the marketing strategy and trading risk policy have been discussed at length with mdea mdea commercial not legal and their commentsquestions incorporated it would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following in words andor formulae the defn and method of establishing the bogey target production cost formula can be an exhibit which would be great for the commercial team to work on fairley david thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties will look at it again conceptually mdea services group and orig are in full agreement so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough rorschach reagan see attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example are we determined how we should deal with imbalances part of cost of power fairley david there are three considerations on this one who wears imbalance exposure two who manages imbalances hourly type activity and three who pays for imbalances imbalances are billed by entergy directly to mdea under their network services agreement epmis hourly desk manages the loadresource items hourly but mdea has the exposure physical and price to imbalances weatherload changes and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances they happen they are uncontrollable and we fix them which epmis hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties a different section in the contract states that mdea wears the exposure how are we setting the bogey formula fairley david the bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the days activities rorschach reagan records of bogey decisions will be archieved subject to audit fairley david yes but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day frankly they would like to have less involvement ie they trust us to do it all but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day two bogeys or one gas and oil fairley david one bogey for power gas is an input for determining the bogey rorschach reagan bogey set dayahead what is defn of profit i think i have the general idea but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check fairley david this is in the pricing calcs should we have a definition what costs are included on the buy and sell side fairley david see cost definition being provided separately re stack model a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used fairley david see definition in my markups to the main agreement updated exhibit on facilities contracted resources operating limits fairley david services and orig are reviewing these but other than what was mentioned above probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem what information does mdea need for us to provide in order to split costsprofits are we clear that cities buy gas mdea buyssells power rorschach reagan i will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily and monthly we need to make sure to limit our info providing responsibilities to those reports it would be great if i could get one set of answers to these questionsissues which has commercial buy in all around thanks kay,04:57:00,"Yes

deepcover stuff out in afghanistan these fel lows are all cousins and brothersinlaw a guy from jersey would stick o ut like a lapdancer in a burqa as we now know instead of being full of f earsome pashtun warriors renowned down the centuries the omarosama ranks were like a novelty gap ad losers of many nations misfit saudis and p akis brits and californians anyone can walk in off the street and be assi stant supervisor of the thirdfloor latrine in tora bora by nightfall the only distinguishing feature about john walker is that hes such an obvious compendium of clappedout clichs from americas left coast the wonder is t he mullahs didnt automatically take him for a cia plant two zero but no mr walker is for real born john lindh in one nine eight one and from that ba stion of wellheeled dopehead progressivism californias affluent marin c ounty following the traditional marin pattern his parents divorced his m other converted to buddhism and the children were taught native american sp irituality john was sent to an alternative high school in the bay area all the high schools are alternative the problem for parents is trying to find any alternative to the alternative the set texts included the au tobiography of malcolm x and john liked it so much that like the late mr x he too decided to embrace islam and change his name to sulayman his par ents putting their foot down for what seems to be the first and last time demanded the right to continue calling him john they had after all gone to the trouble of naming him after one of the colossi of the age john len non to this he consented in return they let him study at the mill valley islamic center two zero in one nine nine eight after an awkward trip to their ancestral ireland in which john tru dged dutifully round the auld sod wearing his turban and white robes frank lindh agreed to let his one seven year old son spend a year in yemen on the next stage of his spiritual odyssey he was just another middleclass kid who d gone off to find himself but like most of the others he always knew h ow to find daddy when he needed to last year john emailed home to say al qaedas attack on the uss cole was justified oh and by the way he was off to enroll in a pakistani madrassa so dad wired him a couple thousand b ucks which goes a long way in bannu aside from a glowing school report fr om his imam that was the last mr lindh heard from junior until he turned up brandishing an akfour seven while battling us armed forces and declaring his approval of the events of september one one th two zero john walkers cv bears eloquent testament to his parents scrupulous observ ance of the bay areas first commandment thou shalt be nonjudgmental y eah man yemen cool whatevers your bag as one headline put it a prod uct of bay area culture exactly i thought but this being the san franc isco chronicle they were applying the label with pride rhapsodizing about the areas religious tolerance and the way children are taught to accep t other cultures and value critical thinking about the us role in the w orld senior writer louis freedberg concluded that walkers only misfortun e was that his search for identity intersected precisely with the world tr ade center attacks if not for this unfortunate intersection walker migh t have become an idealistic doctor the president he said should allow the boy home and let him get his life back on track wed want nothing les s for our own children who could easily have found themselves in a similar mess two zero in fairness to the youth of northern california that last part is an unjus t slur the marvel is that after labouring under the twin burdens of the e ducation systems multicultural orthodoxies and the preening moral superior ity of their boomer parents no more bay area teens have signed on with mul lah omar nonetheless there is a difference between tolerance of other c ultures and the moral inertia displayed by the lindhs we can in any case guess the limits of marin countys muchvaunted tolerance imagine that the marinated muslim had instead announced that he was going to do what th e late cia agent mike spann did at his age enlist in the marines would marilyn walker have seen that as a valid part of her sons selfdiscovery or would she have got out her joss sticks and wailed oh my god where did we go wrong two zero mom says shes proud of john but is taking the line he must have been b rainwashed from the look of him his brains the only thing thats been w ashed john walker resembles one of those hairy smelly cadaverous vaguel y deranged guys who stumble up to you late at night at remote greyhound sta tions and demand money for medication but right now thats shrewd imagepo sitioning president bush seems to have bought the misguided line descri bing walker as a poor fellow who thought he was fighting for a great cau se i cant see him as being unpatriotic says a neighbour this is whe re his journey led him and anyway as everyone says hes just a boy two zero john walker is a two zero year old man though one can sympathize if protracted exposure to the bay areas critical thinking if only has left him in a state of arrested development for four decades supposedly nonjudgmenta l flowerchildren like marilyn walker have reflexively characterized cia m en like mike spann as the dark agents of rightwing militarism we are enti tled to judge marilyns son the comrade of spanns killers as the dark ag ent of leftwing marinism raised by peaceniks and marinated in tolerance he took up an akfour seven in defence of misogynists and gaybashers not an int ernal contradiction but the logical reductio of the new lefts moral nulli ty cocooned in one of the most prosperous enclaves on the planet he was t aught everything from buddhism to indian spirituality to malcolm x ev erything except what it means to be an american citizen two zero when a one three yearold girl wants an abortion the marin county crowd insists t hat a womans right to choose is sacred and even parental notification ta boo twentyyearold men make choices too john walker chose to go to war against his own country americans should respect his right to choose an d let him live with the consequences two zero im not in favour of trying him for treason alan dershowitz and the other highrent lawyers are already salivating over the possibility of a twoyear circus with attendant book deals and tv movies but there is another way suggested the other day by the suns peter worthington in one nine four four lacking th e benefits of an immersion in bay area critical thinking the teenage wor thington volunteered for the royal canadian navy but unlike walkers apol ogists he at least treats him as an adult exercising free will as mr wor thington notes on page four of john walkers us passport it states that any american who enlists in a foreign army can be stripped of his citizensh ip mr walker wants to be abdul hamid mr bush should honour his wishes let us leave him to the northern alliance and let his fancypants frisco l awyers petition to appear before the kabul bar if there is one it would surely be grossly discriminatory to subject mr hamid to

benefits under social security social security reform implications for the financial wellbeing of women statement of jane l ross gao four one zero nine seven privatization plans a threat to womens longterm security privatization would transform todays guaranteed retirement benefits into a risky program that could threaten womens retirement security since women are more likely to rely on social

viewpoint legislative agenda for the one zero six th congress social security privatization national committee to preserve social security and medicare women and retirement security wwwssagov herbert from todays nyt do you feel lucky bob herbert today deconstructed the various arguments for why bushs privatization scheme is too risky one even his chief economic advisor doesnt trust the market mr lindsey who strongly favors mr bushs proposed one three trillion tax cut and argues that it would provide a needed economic stimulus has warned his private clients of a potential stock market tailspin that could lead to a recession he said he sold his own stocks about two years ago so he would be able to sleep at night mr bush told the nation that the key to saving social security retirement benefits was to allow working americans to invest a portion of their social security taxes in the very same stock market that mr lindsey at the moment wants no part of two herbert also questioned bushs motives noting that bushs wall street contributors would make out like bandits under his plan there is however a group of guaranteed winners under mr bushs plan the movers and shakers at the big brokerage houses who have been funneling many millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of mr bush and other politicians just begging them to steer some of the hundreds of billions of dollars in social security taxes their way everyone who sells stocks or mutual funds stands to benefit from this welfare scheme for the notsoidle rich three he explained the chronology of republicans trying to do away with social security face it the republicans have had it in for social security since its inception the historian william manchester wrote about the gops desperate efforts in one nine three six to block its creation on radio spots actors hired by the republican national committee revealed in shocked tones that each man would be given a number as though there were any other way to keep track of social security accounts and perpetrated the hoax that people would be fingerprinted when the republicans won control of congress in one nine four six party leaders called for the repeal of social security and nearly four decades later governor bushs fellow texan senator phil gramm could be quoted as follows on the question of eliminating minimum benefits for the elderly they are eight

enron one is as a financial economist the other as the director of the newly formed global mobility innovation initiative gmii this is the research project funded by lucent involving bu lbs and insead to study various aspects of the mobile internet read three g on the former i am working with a couple of phd students in understanding a details of how having physical supply inventory can be used by a market maker this is a problem that has been studies in the context of specialists inventory in the stock market but i think really interesting in the way enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth i think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber that is in the ground b how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that most finance people miss having options is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another all of the incomplete contracting asymmetric information and incentive issues are ignored in real options valuation models but they are real in practice my impression is enrons real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problems by imposing a market disciplining c how enron manages the various books that involve physicals financials credit etc this is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore include nonlinear risk profiles the story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets enron has been moving into over the last few years on the gmii front i think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber i am working with several people at lucent on this issue i think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call clearly having vince kaminski in the room would be very important to me as for schedules the first three weeks of april are horrible april two six two seven may three four are good for me regards

megawatts of ontario power generations operating generating capacity will be in play by the end of the first quarter company president and chief executive ron osborne said monday as reported the oilandnatural gas burning lennox plant near kingston and the coalfired lakeview generating plant in mississauga have joined the bruce nuclear plant on ontario powers divestiture list osborne said ontario power would like to auction the two one four zero megawatt lennox and one one four zero mw lakeview plants before november when ontarios competitive electricity market is due to start he refused to speculate on the plants market values when added to the two seven zero zero megawatts of planned independent generation in ontario and to the one seven zero zero megawatts that independent generators supply today and the roughly four zero zero zero megawatts that can be brought into the province through interconnections by this time next year we could see up to one five zero zero zero megawatts provided by other companies osborne said in a luncheon speech the company chose to put lennox and lakeview on the block because they are peaking plants and thus frequently set prices in ontarios near monopoly wholesale market osborne explained after his speech ontario power has agreed to give up wholesale market share to enable more competitors to participate in the upcoming spot market the company must first decontrol or give up control over four zero zero zero mw of pricesetting plants typically coalfired or hydro powered lennox whose four five three five mw oilfired units have recently been reconfigured to burn natural gas as well is known as ontarios laston firstoff plant because it is run when electricity demand is greatest as for lakeview four of its eight coalfired units arent operational the plant located west of toronto in mississauga was supposed to be the site of a new naturalgas fired generating station called lakeview new generation the project announced in december one nine nine eight was to be developed by ontario power calgarybased atco power and two ontario municipal utilities one of the four partners municipal distributor hydro mississauga recently withdrew from the project a spokesman for ontario power said any sale of the site would likely involve negotiations for the new gas project but as far as the partners are concerned its still a viable proposition theyre looking into said the spokesman if ontario powers bruce a nuclear station can be brought back into service either by the company or by a new investor this would also contribute another three zero zero zero megawatts of clean electricity to the provincial supply picture said osborne the company has met with several potential partners in its bruce nuclear plant and expects to report to its shareholder the provincial government in the next few weeks he said jake brooks spokesman for independent power producers society of ontario said the two divestitures announced monday are important these are large enough power plants that its a good step towards breaking up the concentration of ownership in the power sector he said ontario powers small hydroelectric plants are also rumored to be for sale he said it makes sense that the company would try to sell those too because theyre best run by small operators said brooks ippsos concern is that the divestitures be conducted in as open a manner as possible said brooks and as weve said before any proceeds over book value should be dedicated to paying down the stranded debt of the former ontario hydro he added ontario power is the largest of five successor companies to ontario hydro which left behind a legacy of cthree eight one billion in outstanding debt and other liabilities when it was split up in april one nine nine nine the successor companies are responsible for paying of a portion of that debt but the provincial finance ministry estimates cseven eight billion of the total

enrononline finally boiled over in public yesterday at chicagos ldc forum a representative from enrononline had to fend off verbal attacks from competitors and from the audience who criticized the system as giving enron the ability to manipulate prices and provide it with an unfair advantage over competitors scott coleman an official at altra energy technologies said proprietary systems like enrononline and systems being developed by a consortium of large market players represent a danger to the health of the energy industry because of their current or potential market power altrade operates its own independent online exchange that is one of enrons biggest electronic competitors it differs from enononline in that various buyers and sellers trade with each other with altrade serving to clear the transactions on enrononline enron posts bid and asked prices and is a party in every transaction the proprietary enrononline trading system has been accused of market manipulation mainly because of its tremendous growth since going live last november and because of the market strength of its operator enron corp enron is the energy industrys largest marketertraderrisk manager and one of the largest natural gas pipeline operators about six zero of its marketing and trading business today is done over the enrononline system critics charged that enrononline provides a tremendous advantage to its parent because all of the transaction data is thrown into a historical database that is available only to enron enrononline has handled more than two eight zero zero zero zero transactions worth one four zero billion since going live the proprietary system handles about two zero zero zero transactions every day with a value estimated at one billion and most of its online business is natural gas and power sales and purchases why has the system been so successful its free easy to use low risk and there is a tight bidask spread both enrononline and its competitors note theres no special hardware required everything is on the web and a transaction is as simple as a couple clicks of the mouse it also provides a broad variety of information including prices on one zero zero zero products and is supported by the largest energy marketing firm although there are many other systems out there few if any have the content ease of use and price discovery of enrononline critics claimed that power enables enrononline to soak up liquidity in the marketplace and in doing so give itself a tremendous advantage over its competitors with each trade enron gains a little bit more information about its competitors positions in the market over the long term i think the market will always correct itself said altras coleman but in the short term i think if any one player has enough of a presence in any one market they can cause prices to move in one direction or another enrononline director bob shults said the company is simply providing a service for our customers particularly a bid and ask but i dont think enron has the ability to move markets we are just putting a bid and ask out there and if people want to buy at our prices then fine if people want to sell at our prices fine then sell it i dont think we have the market manipulation capability people suspect we are not bigger than the marketplace when asked specifically about historical data collected on those who use the system shults denied the company studies the buying and selling patterns of its competitors with an eye toward manipulation sort of the big brother of the energy marketplace the historical information is not available enrononlines shults admitted we just started calculating the indices and price reports we are now providing that information to the market so everyone else has that information as well he said enron does not retain information about those who use its system shults did however warn that the system will make the us energy market much more closely connected to the global marketplace in the future with increasing demand for lng imports and rapid price discovery of worldwide commodities on enrononline for example market activity in africa and the far east could have a more immediate impact on domestic markets quoting analysis conducted by forester research inc shults also predicted electronic exchange revenues could grow from five zero zero billion

that john barquin and i are going to discuss with john novak tomorrow at nine am after we work through it i would be glad to forward it to you in short and in answer to your specific question as advised by machado meyer i think that we will either be reissuing new promissory notes for all of the subdebt with new maturity dates or entering into loan agreements between epe and gasmat as borrowers and then the respective enron and shell lenders to extend the maturity date to december three one two zero zero one as the note from celso below explains then we will just deliver request

melissa sent tuesday november two one two zero zero zero seven two zero pm to novak john enron barquin john cc miguelmendozaenroncom subject fw cuiaba subdebt importance high johnjohn we have a new subdebt issue the existing shareholder subordinated loan promissory notes have a maturity of the earlier of december three one two zero zero zero or the closing of thirdparty financing and the central bank registrations reflect that celso has requested mmso to draft letters to the central bank asking for an extension of the maturity to june three zero two zero zero one he says that johannes walzebuck has agreed to the extension of maturity for shell but that he has had no response from enron i think he sent a message to novak powell lammers rangel walzebuck and dutton on nov one three the ar sfa doesnt have an explicit maturity date for the loans but it has a form of note attached which carries the maturity date the notes are to be considered a part of the agreement the form of note attached to the ar sfa carries default interest but the simple form notes that are actually in existence the ones that were just printed do not have default interest provisions we had to match the original registrations and default interest was not a registered payment condition unless you all want to just leave the notes and hope that we can collect default interest i have asked mmso what we need to do i assume we have to issue replacement promissory notes with the new maturity date we would then send the notification letters to the central bank notifying them of the extension we also need to address this in the two nd a to the ar sfa my note below tries to explain what all is going on with the various assignments and notifications the main thing i need from you is to let me know what your thoughts are from an enron perspective and how you wish for me to proceed do you need to talk to lammerspowellgay let me know regards melissa original message from beckworth melissa sent

john enron hopkinson rick enron subject cuiaba subdebt celso i apologize that i have not been able to speak with you about this i do not recall receiving a message from you about this previously and i have been out of the office without access to my email or international service all day today the amended and restated shareholders funding agreement will have to be amended there is a two nd amendment in draft form right now that has not been finalized to include a new form of note with the new maturity date we will also have to draft some form of letter agreementwaiver to address the fact that the maturity of the previously issued promissory notes is being extended perhaps this can just be an additional provision in the two nd amendment fabio and irenne will we need to issue replacement promissory notes with the new maturity date for all of the existing promissory notes or is there any other way to address this effectively under brazilian law also fabio and irenne with respect to the notification letters for the tr buyout loans i wonder if it might be easier to go ahead and deliver the notices of assignment to the central bank because the loans that were assigned and the loans mentioned in the letters do not encompass all of the shareholder loans the shell assignment agreement for the sgl to schl assignment for epe should be complete within the next few days and is dated as of september three zero two zero zero zero i assume shell has notification letters to deliver as well for that assignment did you receive my fax with the markup of the notification letters maybe we could do this in two steps one deliver the notification of assignment letters and schedules for the transredes buyout and for the shell assignment of epe loans from sgl to stdcl two execute two nd amendment to a r shareholders funding agreement with new form of promissory note with new maturity and approving extension of maturity date of existing loans complete the enron assignments of the replacement notes for epe and gasmat credits to enron netherlands holdings bv and notify the central bank of the extension of the maturity date on the existing promissory notes and of the enron assignments the reason i suggest this breakdown is that the items in number one are basically complete and have been approved the others are not complete yet and could be done in the next week or two i know this is a lot to coordinate you can let me know if you have suggestions about the different steps we should take and in what order i will try to speak to john and john about the

this summer as the state has reserves of about two zero percent utility companies have already increased their rates to cover higher fuel costs unless coal and oil wholesale prices increase sharply consumers should not expect major rate increases georgia blackouts and brownouts are unlikely in the state because a forprofit regulatory system gives suppliers an incentive to build more generating plants rising costs for natural gas which fuels almost all new electric plants could increase residential electric bills by two five percent hawaii there is little likelihood of blackouts rolling brownouts or price spikes as an island state hawaiis electricity system is not connected with that of other states each island has its own generation system and supply is sufficient to meet demand idaho there is little chance of blackouts or rolling brownouts but bills are rising the states largest utility wants a three four percent increase in residential rates illinois blackouts and rolling brownouts are unexpected as generating has been increased with a number of small peaker plants homeowners shouldnt see a rate increase either electricity rates are locked in through two zero zero four under the states deregulation plan indiana there is no expectation of blackouts or brownouts unless there are weeks of very hot weather or a power plant stops operating utility companies are urging consumers to conserve energy and believe that will maintain the remaining state energy surpluses which have decreased from three zero percent to one zero percent over the past decade iowa while the state does not expect blackouts this summer problems could occur as early as two zero zero two with serious capacity problems by two zero zero six only singledigit price increases are expected this summer kansas blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely kansas has never had a regional transmission blackout the size of electric bills will depend on how hot it gets and how much power customers use for air conditioning state law prohibits price spikes by regulated utilities which supply seven zero percent of residential customers kentucky electricity rates in the state are among the lowest in the nation but will likely rise between three two percent and three eight percent by two zero zero three largely due to pollution control equipment upgrades there is adequate supply to avoid brownouts and blackouts this summer louisiana no blackouts are expected this summer but utility officials say the state is on the verge of a power crisis unless more plants are built consumer advocates say bills are likely to increase by as much as three zero percent with very high natural gas prices and a hot summer in the forecast maine five new natural gasfired power plants are on line or coming on line soon reducing the prospect of any rolling blackouts no consumer rate increases are expected maryland the public service commission does not expect any service interruptions and believes electricity rates will not rise an electric deregulation plan implemented last year reduced and then froze rates for homes and businesses massachusetts blackouts and brownouts are unlikely because new england has added a half dozen new power plants in the past one eight months enough supply to outpace demand surges residents will likely see hefty rate hikes in the winter including as much as four two percent for some consumers michigan under a state law signed last year that will deregulate the electricity industry in two zero zero two utilities cut rates by five percent and must cap those rates for five years although demand for electricity is growing between two percent and three percent annually utilities say they have enough supply to meet demand minnesota no blackouts or rolling brownouts are likely unless there is an extended heat wave or a power plant failure electricity costs are expected to remain steady many customers however will spend the summer months paying off natural gas and electricity bills from the long cold winter mississippi blackouts this summer are unlikely the two main power suppliers are taking measures to boost their reserves during peak summer months and new independent generating plants also are available mississippi power expects bills for customers to be three percent to six percent higher this summer entergy another supplier has not filed its summer rate plan yet missouri utilities have plenty of generating capacity and supply contracts so service interruptions arent expected the state public service commission says three large utilities are bringing new or expanded generating plants on line state law bars rate spikes by pscregulated utilities so customer bills shouldnt reflect higher generating costs montana blackouts and rolling brownouts are not expected montana power customers will not see price increases this summer because the company is under a virtual rate freeze until july two zero zero two flathead electrics rates rose two nine percent on april one and an additional six zero percent increase is possible this fall the two companies serve more than half of the customers in montana nebraska no rolling blackouts are expected electric bills are not expected to increase since the states largest utility already increased its rates by two percent to four percent nevada major utilities are not expecting blackouts or rolling brownouts but monthly electricity bills for two power companies will go up one percent to two percent a month through september based on alreadyauthorized incremental rate increases state lawmakers reacting to californias energy crisis are processing measures that would block deregulation from taking effect gov kenny guinn also has said he will not let deregulation take effect under one nine nine seven and one nine nine nine laws unless hes confident consumers wont be harmed new hampshire blackouts are unlikely but customers may have to conserve power on very hot days as part of deregulation rates will drop about one two percent for customers of the states largest electric utility but rates could rise two zero percent to three zero percent for customers of the secondlargest utility new jersey blackouts are unlikely because of protections included in a two yearold energy deregulation law rates are capped until two zero zero three however regulators allowed utilities to raise natural gas rates over the summer two percent a month through july to make up for money lost over the winter to skyrocketing fuel prices new mexico most of the state will escape power outages and rate increases during the summer months new york to head off potential power shortfalls in new york city the new york power authority is rushing to finish construction of one one small natural gas turbines upstate new yorks largest utility says it has enough power to avoid blackouts and brownouts during the summer rates are regulated across much of the state but in new york city customers pay market prices north carolina no blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected no major rate cases are pending in the state among the large regulated utilities north dakota the state exports about seven zero percent of the electricity produced from seven coalfired power plants and is facing no power shortages this summer electricity bills to power air conditioners are not expected to double from the previous summer the way natural gas bills doubled in the winter ohio no blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected unless there is a long heat wave prices for residential customers will remain flat for the next five years as part of a deregulation plan that took effect jan one oklahoma there is little likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts between may and september but oklahoma gas electric which has seven zero zero zero zero zero customers in the state and northwestern arkansas expects electricity bills to be one zero percent to one five percent above last summer oregon some extraordinary measures may be needed to ensure there are no rolling blackouts or brownouts this summer the measures could include curtailing hydroelectric programs that help salmon price spikes could occur pennsylvania no blackouts or brownouts are expected the state is a net exporter of power and has more than enough supply to meet demand electricity bills will not rise this summer because power companies agreed to cap their rates in come cases through two zero one zero rhode island blackouts are unlikely partly because of power plants built in new england in recent years businesses could see electric rates rise as much as four six percent south carolina with reserves of about one five percent there is very little chance of power interruption in the state two major utilities have obtained rate increases of about three percent to reflect higher fuel costs increased demand from summer air conditioning normally pushes summer bills up five zero percent by july south dakota the majority of power comes from dams or coalfired generating plants rather than natural gas there is little chance of power shortages this summer and rates should remain stable tennessee tennessee valley authority electric rates were last raised in one nine nine seven and should remain steady through the summer no blackouts or brownouts are expected texas additional transmission lines should reduce the likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts certain fuel surcharges related to natural gas prices may cause higher electricity bills utah officials are counting on californians to cut their energy use and free more power for use on the western electricity grid to avoid blackouts or brownouts utah power has received a nine four percent interim rate increase and has one nine percent rate increase awaiting approval vermont chances of blackouts or brownouts are low much of vermonts electricity is imported from quebec though the state is also dependent on the regional power grid that serves new england electric rates are regulated virginia blackouts and brownouts are highly unlikely because of an increase in the generating capacity of the states largest utility the size of electric bills will be determined by the weather and consumption not any change in rates which are capped through two zero zero seven washington blackouts and brownouts are unlikely although utilities will have a razorthin power margin that would not withstand the loss of a power plant or transmission line electricity largely comes from dams and a severe drought is reducing the water supply and raising prices industrial and residential customers of public utility districts have already seen rate increases rates could rise one zero percent to two zero percent this year west virginia generating capacity is sufficient to meet peak air conditioning needs none of the four major utilities has requested a rate increase wisconsin electric bills could run as much as one zero percent higher this summer because of surcharges to cover rising prices for natural gas which fuels many plants state officials ordered utilities in december to increase their reserves from one five percent to one eight percent to bolster reliability during the summer wyoming blackouts and brownouts are unlikely but could occur because the state grid is intertwined with other systems that could

bride as she turned the radio off california gov gray davis and the state legislature have no better sense of priorities than the bride did theyve been obsessing over the financial solvency of the states utilities for three months instead of making progress on the bigger problem the huge shortage of electricity expected to hit the state this summer californias multibillion dollar purchase of the utilities transmission lines wont add one megawatt to the supply of electricity how big is the imbalance between supply and expected summer demand the california energy commission forecast two weeks ago that the six zero zero zero zero megawatt system might just squeak by with eight seven mw to spare in a bad heat wave but nobody takes that forecast seriously the cecs numbers are way off base californias electricity demand could exceed supply by five or two zero zero zero mw on days with typical summer weather that two zero zero zero mw shortfall will be made up by turning out the lights in two million homes or a mix of homes businesses and industry a bad heat wave would get shortages several times that size as the blackouts roll through parts of the state every weekday that temperatures are at or above normal every business and home will take its turn at getting by without electricity for an hour or so what factory can operate under such conditions will the states elderly survive the heat exposure the cec put the capacity of generators in the state at about five four zero zero zero but it used original capacity figures most of californias big power plants are more than three zero years old they cant produce as much power as they once did so subtract about seven zero zero zero mw from their rated capacity about one five zero zero zero mw of the states capacity is now controlled by merchant energy companies calpine cpn duke energy duk dynegy dyn mirant mir reliant energy rei and williams cos wmb they say they already have sold much of the power they will generate this summer to outofstate western utilities but the cec ignored that hydroelectric generation in the western states is expected to be just six zero of normal this spring and summer western utilities have been buying up supplies since last fall californias pge pcg and edison international eix couldnt do that of course because theyre nearly bankrupt nobody knows exactly how much power has already been sold out of state a trader at one california merchant power company estimated five zero zero zero mw in a recent auction of transmission line use capacity to move electricity out of california sold for up to one five times the price of transmission capacity to move power into the state the cec ignored the sales of california power to outofstate generators in its rosy summer outlook and ignored the forecast for belownormal hydropower which depends on winter snowfall the snowfall season is threefourths over now making a hydropower shortage pretty much a done deal yet the cec used normal northwest hydropower production in its forecast take off another two zero zero zero mw the commission expects three zero zero zero mw of generators to be off line for unplanned repairs when the heat wave hits thats californias historic average but outages usually increase dramatically during a heat wave take off another two zero zero zero mw the commission expects all one zero zero zero mw of davis recently announced peaking generators to be on line for the summer no way says the industry instead of the cecs estimate of six one zero zero zero mw then california can expect available supply of only four four zero zero zero mw the state needs five one zero zero zero mw to meet demand and maintain recommended reserves in the kind of heat wave it gets on average every two summers people in the industry have been telling the governor for nine months that theres no way to raise supply to meet demand this year or next siting and building power plants takes too long demand has to be reduced to the level of supply the current course is to reduce demand through blackouts pricing offers a better way if the state raised electricity rates immediately a step no longer opposed even by california consumer group the utility reform network california would stop burning through the natural gas and water reserves needed to keep generators running this summer davis insists on solving the crisis without a rate increase big enough to damp demand several western us utilities outside california have already imposed such rate hikes davis is focused on buying power even though california cant subsidize consumption of artificially cheap power much longer the department of water resources is signing one zero year power supply contracts at hefty prices that fully reflect todays supplydemand imbalance instead he should be addressing the imbalance which must be dealt with sooner by prices or later by blackouts raise california rates significantly now cut demand and the wholesale price for electricity comes crashing down then sign longterm contracts at the lower rates davis is committing californias citizens and businesses to one zero years of overpriced electricity after that he says he will try to reduce demand his streak of bad decisions in this crisis continues unbroken by mark golden dow jones newswires monday february two six two zero zero one most of west in the same power jam as california utilities other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations swelled and few new energy sources were developed now also facing blackouts they want to tilt balance of power away from the golden state and toward themselves by peter g gosselin times staff writer wintersburg arizfor more than a century california ran a simple account with the rest of the west it demanded and the west supplied most especially water and power but as the western states have ballooned in the last decadein no small part because of an outbound trek of californiansthis simple supplydemand relationship has broken down fundamentally the rest of the west has outgrown its electrical system just as california has its own and it has done so in very much the same wayby adding too many people without enough new power or conservation indeed statistics show that much of the rest of the west would have been on the verge of trouble even without californias help and may yet face the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the golden state the booming southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that its planning reservesthe extra power that utilities build in to handle emergencieshave shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts consider dangerous almost none of the west save montana has increased its power production at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade despite the long economic boom of the one nine nine zero s which smiled especially on the west several such as arizona have failed to complete a single new power plant we dont know how bad its going to be yet said utahs republican governor mike leavitt we wont know that until may june july and august when everyone in the southwest turns on their swamp coolers in trying to dodge the blackout bullet many western leaders are seeking to force a great change on the region to renegotiate their states basic deal with california they want to end an old relationshipthat between center and hinterland colonizer and colonizedand establish a new one that could curtail californias long regional dominance in the strange chemistry of the momentwhen a oncerepublican state government has turned democratic and a oncedemocratic national government has turned republican when the battle is to a large extent over privately owned electricity rather than publicly controlled waterthey could actually meet with some success california spent the two zero th century decolonizing itself from wall street and the east said kevin starr the state librarian and author of a multivolume history of california now all of a sudden theres a dramatic possibility of it being recolonized at least in part by the rest of the west captive plants feed power to california ground zero for these changes lies five zero miles west of phoenix in the dry scrublands of wintersburg this is home to the palo verde nuclear facility now the nations single biggest power producer it will soon be home as well to between three and six new gasfired power plants that combined will produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor palo verde represents a great deal about the old fraying world of regulated utilities and about the supplydemand relationships that california once maintained with the rest of the west more than onequarter of the plant is owned by los angeles municipal utility the department of water and power several other california cities and southern california edison a row of steel latticework towers runs off toward california carrying a transmission line from plant to consumer california has big stakes in a halfdozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from nevada to new mexico from californias point of view the beauty of these projects has been that they provided nearcertain power without the muss of meeting state pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home and at least until the midone nine nine zero s california regulators virtually guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits even if plants power wasnt immediately needed the first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to meet demand no matter what said paul l joskow a veteran utility economist at the massachusetts institute of technology if you had too much power if it cost you a little too much that was less important than being sure you could meet demand and he added you had regulators watching to make sure you did the gasfired plants that are about to pop up in wintersburg are also representative but of the new deregulated world of power production although they will crowd in around palo verde and tap into the same california transmission line they are being built on an entirely different business premise selling power to the highest bidder in fact the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an electricity hot spot lately is not palo verde itself but its huge transmission lines in addition to the california line four others fan out from the plant two back to phoenix one east to new mexico and one north to utah and from there to the northwest all were built to hardwire the nuclear project to its owners but they are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar by sending power wherever prices are highest it used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the market to see if they could meet demand said jack davis president of pinnacle west capital corp which owns arizonas major utility and is putting up two of the wintersburg plants now he said approvingly its being built by people who look at the market to see if you can make a lot of money plans go awry in many states money not the watchful eye of government was what was supposed to assure that electricity deregulation worked the opportunity to make it would cause investors to flock to the electricity business ensuring that plenty of new power plants got built if too many went up it would be investors not ratepayers who suffered if too few then high prices would attract still more investors more plants and ultimately more power but to date almost nothing about deregulation has gone as plannedand not just in california but in the west in general take arizona the state has a handsoff attitude toward business including its utilities it has almost none of the environmental restrictions blamed for keeping california from putting up the new plants it needs its population grew by four zero from one nine nine zero to two zero zero zero according to the census bureau and its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate according to industry figures arizona should have been a power producers heaven said a michael schaal a senior analyst with energy ventures analysis inc a prominent washingtonarea consulting firm but arizonas power production rose a mere four during the one nine nine zero s mostly as a result of improving existing plants until one eight months ago no one had applied to build a major power plant since palo verde in the late one nine eight zero s i guess i go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort of one zero two zero three zero year time horizon arizonas republican gov jane dee hull said in a recent interview i think what we all worry about is are they planning or nevada its utilities apparently did plan and increased electricitymaking capacity between one nine nine zero and two zero zero zero by a substantial four four but that wasnt enough to keep up with the states population which increased six six on thursday nevada gov kenny guinn a republican and former energy company executive indefinitely halted deregulation in his state or traditionally energyrich washington state one of its major utilities seattle city light recently learned that all of its previously planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed and then some by just three new customers computer server farms being built to handle the growing internet traffic in and out of the hightech capital but its unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional supplies are balanced on a razors edge according to northwest power pool president jerry rust we have no cushion indeed the electricity supplies of the entire west are balanced on a razors edge with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this summer schaal the washingtonarea consultant for example said the region will come up six short westerners can expect one five zero to two seven five hours of rolling blackouts most of them in california he said one of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that in contrast to what most people think supplies have not grown short just recently they have been perilously tight for the last several yearsbefore the start of californias troubles of this summer and fall and before the nearrecord dry winter that has left the northwest dangerously short of water for its hydroelectric dams the implication is that california did not cause other states to run short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger it did that according to key observers with one monumentally inept maneuver when california required its major utilities to buy power in the volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along higher costs to consumers it set off a furious price spiral that effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security blanket the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively if local supplies proved inadequate the result has been a string of crises across the west in southern arizona for example the san carlos irrigation project a tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by dropping longterm contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the spot market has announced that its bills are going up three zero zero most of the projects one three three zero zero poor customers say they cant pay in phoenix utility executives who had confidently said the state was rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two five zero yearold steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market in idaho the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps back to the firm company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than purchasing power on the open marketand the potato farmers are likely to do pretty well themselves deep hostility in rest of the west the subtle difference between californias triggering recent events and actually causing the regions crisis is largely lost in the current atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval although leaders of the rest of the west are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big neighbor they are less guarded at home the normally mildmannered leavitt for example was recently quoted as warning a salt lake city audience that california if given the chance would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly in an interview he denied having made the remark such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among westerners that their states are in the words of historian bernard devoto plundered provincesterrain that first easterners and then californians have regularly raided for minerals water and most recently power but this time some western leaders think they can change all this a lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with california to their advantage said stanford historian richard white the attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the west in the northwest oregon washington idaho and montana are redoubling their efforts to take over the bonneville power administration the huge federally controlled generating system on the columbia and snake rivers that is one of californias chief sources of summer electricity the crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the region can be exported without the regions consent oregon gov john kitzhaber said in an interview in arizona state officials have gone from having no proposals for new power plants to being buried by them regulators recently approved the construction of one zero plants including several around palo verde and are considering another eight although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve arizonas needs first the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for whatever prices they can command an arrangement that could leave california just one among many bidders federal officials are unlikely to get in the way gov hull is close to president bush who in turn has shown little interest in helping democratic california perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in utah where leavitt is trying something that could become californias worst nightmarerecalling power that utah produces for the state los angeles dwp and several other california utilities own threequarters of the huge coalfired intermountain power project in westcentral utah and have been drawing on it without incident for one five years but utah officials recently unearthed a longforgotten provision in their agreement with the plants owners that gives them the right with proper notice to recall power for local use the state has already notified los angeles that it is taking back five zero megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another one seven zero next summer and it may be able to take back still more according to plant general manager reed searle although the amounts are trivialthe los angeles utility either owns or has firm contracts for more than seven zero zero zero megawatts of capacityleavitt said utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants in the state including a five zero zero to seven five zero megawatt facility that los angeles is negotiating to build california has chosen not to create its own power generation and has depended on us to do that the utah governor said thats fine and were willing to do that but he added there comes a point at which if demand grows too large weve got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves and for our children and grandchildren if utah and the rest of the west have reached that point california could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which it now suffers times researcher lynn marshall in seattle contributed to this report monday february two six two zero zero one plant construction stalled over states effort to revise contracts power small peaker generators could help california get through the summer without blackouts by nancy vogel times staff writer sacramentothe construction of a fleet of small power plantscapable of supplying one million homesis being stalled because of a dispute between state officials and the plant builders two weeks ago gov gray davis toured a power plant under construction among the orchards of sutter county he ordered state energy commission regulators to roll out the red carpet for anybody willing to quickly build small sometimes temporary generators called peakers to help the state get through next summer without blackouts yet plans for two nine such plants which have been in the works since last fall have been slowed by the state according to the companies hired to build the plants the problem they say is that the california department of water resources which was pushed into the electricity business on an emergency basis last month is trying to amend four monthold contracts for construction of peaker plants state officials say the original contracts gave too much to the plant builders and they want to save the taxpayers money by revising the terms were not delaying any construction said davis spokesman phil trounstine were providing financial assurances for the generators and protections for california consumers theres no reason he added that these guys cant rework these contracts and get these plants up and running on time but peaker plant operators say the contract revisions probably will slow down construction last week harold dittmer found out that the department wants to stretch to one zero years the terms of what had been a threeyear contract with his company sacramentobased wellhead power he said he is scrambling to alter land and equipment leases and isnt certain he will get his four power plants installed in the central valley by the target dates of may and july having to renegotiate the agreements adds uncertainty and uncertainty adds time dittmer said some of the other eight companies with contracts to build peakers say theyve also been asked to alter their contracts the projects will not be done in june as originally contemplated said dale fredericks chief executive officer of dg power inc in the san francisco suburb of walnut creek his company intends to build seven small plants around the state with the combined capacity to supply more than three four zero zero zero zero homes these gasfired plants some so small they fit on the back of a bigrig truck are designed to run a few hours at times of heightened demand most are slated for construction on existing industrial sites such as utility substations officials of the department of water resources did not return calls for comment steve maviglio a spokesman for davis said department officials are confident that the plants will all be finished this summer he said the agencythrust into the powerbuying business as a result of the nearbankruptcy of the states two biggest utilitieswants to amend the original contracts to save money were simply trying to get the best prices for taxpayers maviglio said but in slowing down the plant construction the departments action undermines the governors campaign to quickly expand the states power production two weeks ago davis ordered the energy commission to offer licensing of such plants in two one days or less on wednesday the commission published a list of three two sites around the state that could by its estimation quickly and easily accommodate a peaker plant among these sites targeted for proximity to transmission lines and natural gas supplies are an airport in kern county the port of long beach and a cardboard recycling plant in ontario our target is one zero zero zero megawatts said energy commission spokeswoman claudia chandler fredericks the power plant builder said the states best shot of getting that much peaking power built by this summer is through existing contracts like his so many plants are under construction around the country that there is often a long wait for delivery of the turbines compressors and other crucial components of a power plant he said weve been working on this six months so we have equipment lined up said fredericks who searched worldwide for the parts he needed but somebody coming in right now probably cant find the equipment his company and eight others signed contracts last fall with the california independent system operator that nonprofit agency based east of sacramento in folsom was established under the states one nine nine six deregulation plan to balance the flow of electricity on the transmission grid reaching seven five of california typically caliso wouldnt be in the business of soliciting construction of power plants but a scarcity of supply complicates calisos job managers looking ahead to the summer of two zero zero one predicted last year that the state would be short of electricity by onefifth of what it needs on those hottest afternoons when demand for power spikes upward warning of a very substantial risk of rotating blackouts in the summer of two zero zero one caliso officials signed contracts last october and november for two nine small power plants to be built by june the plants would be capable of providing one two seven nine megawatts of peaktime electricityenough to supply more than one million homesat a cost of two one four million a year for three years that would amount to about six per california household per year caliso staff figured these costs wrote caliso management in a memo to its policymaking board of governors should be weighed against the financial social and human costs associated with blackouts we saw the summer of two zero zero one coming like a freight train said brian theaker manager of reliability contracts at caliso and we gulped and swallowed and said weve got to do this because nobody else is those contracts were signed despite the misgivings of two appointees of the governor in an oct two six letter public utilities commission chairwoman loretta lynch and michael kahn head of the electricity oversight board complained that the contracts for peaker plants seemed too expensive they urged caliso to refrain from signing the contracts until the puc could check whether edison and pge were willing to build the plants more cheaply but the utilities came forward with no such plans and the caliso board approved the contracts under those contracts the plants would be required to produce electricity for five zero zero hours at most this summer when called upon to do so by caliso but work on the plants tapered off in january when the deteriorating financial condition of edison and pge threw the future of caliso into jeopardy caliso doesnt actually buy electricity it bills utilities for the power it needs to balance the grid so as edison and pge spiraled toward bankruptcy in december caliso lost its creditworthy status and companiesand their lendersfeared doing business with the agency to calm those fears and to get construction underway the department of water resources has offered to replace caliso in the contracts but that has not yet happened as department officials seek to change the contracts the state has hired a massachusetts firm navigant to renegotiate the deals if dwr would just assume the contracts as they are wed all be in high gear dittmer said saturday february two four two zero zero one electricity crisis dims firms opinion of state polling four out of one zero small companies are less happy about californias business climate and two zero are looking at a move by nancy rivera brooks times staff writer four out of one zero small companies say californias electricity crisis has dimmed their view of the state as a place to do business and nearly two in one zero are exploring a move to another state according to a survey released friday by the national federation of independent business the survey one of the first to attempt to gauge the toll on business from the energy meltdown follows other polls issued this week that illuminate vastly different views of deregulation and the retail competition that it is intended to spark most california consumers said they still favor electricity competition in a survey conducted by jd power associates more than half of the seven five zero people interviewed said they did not understand deregulation but six four said the state should continue to support competition in the electricity industry but another survey by the boozallen hamilton consulting firm found that most commercial and industrial companies were wholly unprepared to take advantage of retail electricity competition around the nation and that few switched to new electricity providers while most of those that switched saved money on their electricity bills one zero paid the same or even more for power if nothing else the three surveys underscore that problems in the electricity industry are confusing expensive frustrating and disruptive for all involved this is a major issue the no one issue for small business said martyn hopper state director for the national federation of independent business an advocacy group for small companies although california businesses have raised serious concerns about both energy costs and supply the states economy so far has shown only limited damage just more than two zero of respondents said they had been hit by blackouts since the beginning of the year the telephone survey of five two three small businesses conducted for nfib by masondixon polling research of maryland found but there clearly was some confusion among those answering the survey about whether these were the rotating blackouts that hit northern and central california on jan one seven and one eight or whether these were voluntary power outages under utility programs that ask businesses to cut electricity usage when supplies are extremely tight for example nine four of respondents in the los angeles area said they had experienced a blackout when no forced outages occurred south of bakersfield for whatever reason the lights went out more than half of the businesses were forced to severely curtail or terminate business operations for the entire blackout about onethird said they lost sales nearly two one said materials were damaged or destroyed and nearly four zero had to absorb wage costs for work not done businesses were almost evenly split on whether the blackouts would lower earnings and nearly eight out of one zero were not planning any layoffs as a result but the electricity mess has damaged the companies views of california as a secure business home slightly more than four three said the power problem had changed their views about california as a place to do business and nearly seven one said it had shaken their confidence in the states political and business leadership but a whopping six nine said they have no intention of moving their companies to another state our members dont have the option of moving to texas or colorado in search of cheaper or more reliable power hopper said a lot of them are family owned and minority owned and they want to do business in california news analysis once accused of inactivity davis now takes lead role the governor has shifted into campaign mode in the power crisis trying to convince voters critics and investors that he can steer the state toward recovery by dan morain and rone tempest times staff writers just a month ago gov gray davis was under fire for failing to move quickly and forcefully to quell californias energy crisis but in recent weeks the governor has moved into campaign modetouring power plants with tv cameras in tow and issuing a steady stream of proclamations that declare victories in the power battle his mission is to convince voters in california analysts on wall street and politicos across the country that he is up to solving what he insists on calling the energy challenge davis is doing what any politician on the hustings would do head out to a power plant under construction as he did recently put on a hard hat and tell gathered reporters that he is working to make sure the state will have enough power to meet its needs because it is so complicated and hydraheaded said garry south davis chief political consultant we really felt he had to move out and simplify and objectify what he is doing otherwise people simply wouldnt see that he had a plan to solve the problem this isnt rocket science south added the communication tools and techniques that any elected official has dont differ that much from what is available in a campaign davis arrived friday night in washington dc on the first leg of a fiveday east coast trip that will take him to wall street in recent weeks he has compiled a story to tell of actions he has taken that suggest he is on top of the situation critics counter that his plans are half measures on friday for example he did not announce a final deal to rescue the states three private utilities from their multibillion dollar debt rather he proclaimed that he had the framework of an accord with one of the utilities southern california edison however the goal is to show progress even if its incremental the public just wants it solved said democratic political consultant darry sragow who doesnt work for davis he is working to show that he is working to solve the problem if there is a view that no one is solving his problem all hell will break loose the actions are a far cry from the situation in january when utility executives power generators and lawmakers were loudly blaming davis for failing to recognize the power crisis and for not taking steps soon enough to get california on course for recovery davis confidantes say there was no single event that led to the governors decision to position himself as the man who would lead california out of the crisis but the governor pays close attention to politicsconferring at least weekly with his team of political advisors and regularly scrutinizing public opinion polls after convening two focus groups on the topic last month the governor and his political advisors led by south concluded that davis needed to take a higher profile the prospect of the states two major utilities going broke also spurred the governor into action it became important to let wall street creditors generators and the public understand that we were making progress said davis communication director phil trounstine thats a big piece of why youve seen the governor personally carrying the message davis still has critics including many in his party but few can say that he is still suffering from inaction he is pushing for a state takeoverat a cost of more than seven billionof private utilities electrical transmission systems and spending money at a clip of one billion a month to buy electricity flush with a multibillion budget surplus the davis administration has spent more than two billion to buy electricity so far it is offering an extra four zero zero million for conservation measures and pledges to spend millions more to speed construction of new power plants aides say practical reasons prevented davis from taking a more public role sooner he was spending most of his time gaining an understanding of the problem and looking for solutions davis was freed up only after he assembled his energy team led by former edison executive michael peevey san francisco lawyer michael kahn and department of water and power chief s david freeman the trio gave davis the expertise to negotiate with utility executives and power generators once they were in place davis had time to make public appearances like the one in yuba city earlier this month themed around generation and power plant constructionthe stuff of photo opportunities it was a collective view that because this problem was so complicated and abstract he had to move out south said and of course davis political future is widely seen to ride on the outcome lawmakers give davis credit for deflecting blame for the crisis from his office even if it means they pay the price but now that davis has taken the lead role he faces risks if the plan fails im convinced if it blows up he is going to get the worst of it said one senior democrat added sragow were not talking about anything that is particularly subtle or sophisticated the governor is chief executive the point person if the person who is the obvious choice doesnt lead there will be unrest and someone will try to fill the vacuum davis efforts are beginning to result in some praise a utility executive who a month ago was highly critical said after davis announced the makings of a rescue plan for edison that the governor forged a difficult and creative and complex agreement i think you have to give him points for that the executive said this story was reported by dan morain in los angeles and rone tempest in sacramento california has appetite for electricity but is no power glutton andrew bridges associated press writer mondayfebruary two six two zero zero one breaking news sections zero two two six one two three nine pst los angeles ap californias power crisis has led neighboring states to accuse the golden state of hogging electricity but the numbers tell a different story california does use a vast amount of electricity but it consumes less on a percapita basis than all other states except rhode island the mild climate and less heavy industry than other states are part of the reason experts say credit also must go to stringent conservation measures its true were big and its true we didnt build a lot of power plants but were not energy hogs at all said arthur rosenfeld who sits on the fivemember california energy commission were almost as good as western europe and western europe is about twice as energyefficient as the united states among the five zero states only texas consumes more energy measured by its total use of electricity natural gas and oil than california the nations most populous state however california ranks four seven th in percapita energy use well below no four texas no two zero washington and no two seven oregon according to the energy information administration which is part of the us energy department when looking specifically at percapita electricity consumption california ranks four nine th at two four two million btus the agency said californians percapita electricity use is only six zero percent of the national average for air conditioning alone a typical california household uses onethird the amount of electricity consumed by a household in texas or florida according to the us energy departments one nine nine seven residential energy consumption survey california has a different climate so even if you do have warm summers theyre not humid so you dont have the big huge air conditioning load you see in florida or texas said robert latta the surveys manager at the energy information administration california also uses electricity as well as natural gas oil and coal more wisely than most states thanks to aggressive conservation efforts started during the oil shocks of the early one nine seven zero s federal and state data indicate key to those efforts are stringent standards for new homes and commercial buildings that dictate such things as the types of windows and lighting and the amount of insulation if it is not the leading state they are at least tied for it in efficiency standards said ed wisniewski deputy director of the bostonbased consortium for energy efficiency historically they have been very progressive and many of the programs we advocate nationally were started in california californias percapita use also is lower because many energyintensive industries are located elsewhere aluminum smelting and paper manufacturing for example are clustered in the pacific northwest the industries that are located in california however are generally more efficient in their use of electricity than industries elsewhere according to one nine nine eight figures from the california energy commission which shapes state energy policy companies use just zero two kilowatthours of electricity to produce every dollars worth of goods and services in california while businesses in neighboring states use twice as much according to commission figures the concept that california is a big wasteful state really isnt true said latta of the energy information administration there is still room for improvement in california particularly when it comes to conservation california ranks just one seven th among all states in spending by utilities on energyefficiency programs as part of their revenue in one nine nine eight california utilities reduced spending on energyefficiency programs though the current crisis has prompted the major utilities to reverse that according to the american council for an energyefficient economy gov gray davis recently released a four zero four million conservation program designed to control growth in the states demand for electricity maintaining energy efficiency and keeping demand in check as the population grows will be among the toughest challenges in the years ahead energy use per capita is up one zero percent over the past two decades californians used about seven zero zero zero kilowatt hours per year in one nine eight zero compared with about seven seven

jones key lawmakers in the california assembly and senate on monday were only willing to offer partial support for a plan by gov gray davis to buy the power lines owned by the states three investorowned utilities their hesitance calls into question the chances of quick passage for the measure which is the centerpiece of the governors plan to keep the states two largest utilities from sliding into bankruptcy there are way too many unanswered questions about it both fundamental and logistical questions said the chief of staff to one key democratic lawmaker on friday gov davis announced at a news conference that he reached an agreement in principle with edison international eix unit southern california edison to purchase the utilitys transmission lines for two seven six billion roughly two three times their book value davis said he hopes to finalize the deal by friday when he also hopes to announce similar deals for sempra energy sre unit san diego gas electric and pge corp pcg unit pacific gas electric davis aides said the state is willing to pay about seven five billion for the two six zero zero zero miles of transmission lines owned by the three utilities the buyout is aimed to restore the utilities to solvency and help them restructure nearly one three billion in undercollected power costs the companies have amassed during two zero zero zero but lawmakers said the measure wont sail through the legislature state sen debra bowen dredondo beach who chairs the senate energy committee said she isnt willing to sign off on the transmission plan until the state secures concessions from generators and other creditors she also questioned the price the governor has offered for the power lines there are a number of advantages to having the state own and control the transmission lines but its not something we should do at any price bowen said adding that the deal should also have value to ratepayers for the past several weeks key lawmakers bowen assembly speaker robert hertzberg assemblyman fred keely senate leader john burton and assembly republican minority leader bill campbell the democratic and republican lawmakers who have stood with davis during previous news conferences have been missing advisers said the lawmakers have decided not to endorse davis plan until more information has been released sen burton who introduced legislation three weeks ago to have the state purchase the utilities transmission lines also wouldnt declare his support for the governors plan as the governor noted this is an agreement in principle and the legislature awaits further details said burton press secretary dave sebeck other democrats refused to comment on the transmission plan while republicans have been the most vocal opponents i dont see how we can pay for the transmission lines without a rate increase campbell said if you refinance your house from a one zero zero zero zero zero mortgage to a two three zero zero zero zero mortgage youre going to have to pay more thats a simple fact consumer groups have blasted the governors proposal likening it to a bailout of the utilities michael shames executive director of the utilities consumer action network said the price the state is offering to pay for southern california edisons power lines is the outer limits of what can be financially justified as a purchase price for the transmission harvey rosenfield of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights said he will try and overturn the measure with an initiative on the two zero zero two ballot but davis isnt

added that the gtn pipeline system is the most direct and economic link for tapping the canadian production basins and bringing the load to california and the pacific northwest markets he also emphasized that the expansions would help the market prepare for new supply from alaska we are constantly talking to our customers about what is the right time for us to expand our pipeline system said sandra mcdonough spokeswoman for pge corp with the power plant development both in california and in the pacific northwest including plants in the northwest that are being built right next to our pipeline the time is clearly now to start expanding the system we have gotten more bids for capacity than we have been able to move recently mcdonough told daily gpi last week that the company was looking to expand its mainline in the near future see daily gpi dec one three to gauge demand pge neg plans to launch an open season for the two zero zero mmcfd expansion of the mainline beginning on jan two two zero zero one bids are due by feb one five two zero zero one following the open season the company will hold a capacity rationalization period which will allow existing shippers to release capacity directly to customers who have expressed an interest the six one two mile dual pipe gtn system begins at the idahobritish columbia border travels through northern idaho southeastern washington and central oregon and terminates at the oregoncalifornia border where it connects with the pacific gas and electric co intrastate pipeline system currently the gtn system is the largest us transporter of canadian natural gas with two seven bcfd of capacity the expansion was deemed necessary because the average contract term on the line extends through two zero one three and the pipeline has been operating at capacity or near capacity for most of two zero zero zero the method of expansion had not been decided on yet but it is expected to include additional compression and some looping mcdonough said pge has been in contact with its upstream providers including transcanada pipelines limited tcpl to ensure coordination of capacity doug baldwin ceo of tcpl said transcanada will work with pge neg to examine and if appropriate satisfy the needs of market participants in both the western united states and canada if response to the open season is adequate pge neg hopes to move along with the project immediately the november two zero zero two in service date includes an anticipated oneyear process to obtain a federal energy regulatory commission ferc permit we also expect to have an incremental two six five mmcfd of new directconnect gasfired electric generation load along the gtn system in the pacific northwest by midtwo zero zero two king said we expect to follow the two zero zero two project immediately with additional pipeline expansions to meet the need for additional gas supplies in the pacific northwest on both the east and west sides of the cascade mountains for the next fivetoeight years pge corp expects to be busy with pipeline expansions and new additions the company has planned a second mainline expansion to be in service in two zero zero four with a new interconnect near spokane wa which will serve the puget soundseattle area the last expansion phase will be brought online sometime after two zero zero five with alaskan gas fields expected to be ready for commercial service in the next five to one zero years pge neg will build an expansion that will facilitate transportation of gas from alaska and canadas northwest territories to markets in the lower four eight states overall what we are looking at is the potential to expand the system by one bcfd over the next decade mcdonough said,01:52:00,No

talks between coke and quaker are over cokes board of directors met yesterday to discuss the potential one five seven five billion stock acquisition of quaker cocacola wanted quaker for the same reason that pepsi did the gatorade sports drink gatorade controls about eight zero of the sports drink market with cokes powerade coming in second coke would have been saddled though with those parts of quakers business that make up the majority of its revenues and are growing the slowest its cereal and oatmeal operations its likely that several factors led to the decision by cokes board not to proceed with the quaker acquisition first with value guru warren buffett as a director you better believe that the price coke was going to pay for quaker was a very important consideration cokes shares had been driven down one zero since the potential deal was announced monday as many thought coke would be paying too much for quaker another factor that likely caused the board to reject the acquisition was the potential for antitrust hangups with the deal given that cokes sports drink powerade controls the largest part of the market after gatorade a third contributing factor was probably one of focus coke refocused itself on its core beverages business in the late one nine eight zero s and buying quaker with its capn crunch and ricearoni among other brands would have moved it beyond the beverage business once again the company doesnt appear to want to take that route so pepsis out cokes out and already another company has announced that its pulling a chair up to the bidding table

to a very successful conclusion and the new rates will go into effect towards the end of this month the rates are not much lower than what we filed for and represent a very significant increase over the previous rates the tariff methodology and revised regulations put into effect by the supreme decree were followed to the letter by the regulator despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down the deliverables here were to one obtain a tariff methodology via supreme decree that would make the company financeable rescue it from dire financial straits and two file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the tariff methodology this second deliverable has now been completed transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the uncertainty about rates it is my understanding that the financial market loved the ruling and that transredes sold four zero million worth of bonds in about five minutes this ruling should also

delighted to report that sirese approved substantial increases in trs tariffs consistent with the law and regulation the details are existing tariff sirese approved increase trclhb proposed trclhb

nine three five two eight one nine six five as you can see we did substantially better than clhb comparable with our liquids domestic we will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by sirese to reach their conclusions on monday but our inteligence suggests the following one export gas volumes increased to one zero zero tr capacity and one zero zero gsa cuiaba two assumed for sda and temin purposes two rg compresion project deleted three interest rate reduced to one zero or one zero five ie the rate in our bond issue four liquids expansion in the south reduced five some continuity of service capex reduced six unknown opex reduction and maybe a change to the opex allocation between concesions seven occ in service date slipped from two zero zero three to two zero zero four eight debtequity assumption changed from six zero four zero to seven zero three zero our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows one volumes covered by eight rule we can blete but can expect little back here clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the short term ie two zero zero two two zero zero three two rg compression not worth fighting for since we dont even have the support of bg three interest rate well get this back when we do a tariff revision and actual rates are used when we get the detail we will appeal if jan feels we have concrete grounds ie commision costs etc are omited four liquids expansion in the south here we intend to do a detailed analysis of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquidsgas production will be shut in if possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected producers pb bg vintage and chaco we will then write to those producerscopy sirese vmeh etc stating that on their recommendation the project scope was reduced by sirese we will give them an estimate of the lost liquidsgas production in both volume and cash terms resultant from this decision we will tell them that since they proposed these reductions we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal five continuity of service capex we need to see the detail here we will take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared to compromise our safety and environmental standards we need to see exactly what has been removed but my thought is that if that means we are unable to provide some services eg lpg transportation or the continued operation of some liquids laterals we should write to those producers affected suggesting that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the decision again since this is capex we will get it back in the end on tariff revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the sirese budget process six opex need to see the detail on monday seven occ will not appeal we need to do a detailed study to develop an occ strategy eight debtequity ratio strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance with the

three zero b we can only borrow for capex as per bond issue and the policy of allmost bankslending institutions with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover one zero zero of capex we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from six zero four zero we intend to fight this one very hard using all the externalindependant help we can get as you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut this has not happened sirese has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much smaller and hence managable increases attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above points and the corporate model using the new tariff with

klauberg jklauberllgmcom zero three one five two zero zero one one zero two zero am to cyoderectenroncom elizabethsagerenroncom cc chriscalgerenroncom pboylstonstoelcom subject call with pirog private set forth is a brief summary of my call with john pirog last night overall i felt we made a lot of progress at the end of the call pirog said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible but at the end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the issues and he said he was going to send some sample language for our consideration on a few of the points we said that we would be begin to modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and that we could then compare notes he said that cdwr viewed the enron contract as an important one and he said he would be back to us fairly quickly material regulatory change provision pirog said cdwr would be willing to accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects cdwrs ability to perform under the contract most particularly its ability to pay for power such an event likely would be a ca legislature or regulatory generated change pirog said he thought that cdwr would agree to a termination payment if this occurred although they may not want the mrc to be characterized as a default which should not be a problem from our standpoint cdwr would not be willing to protect epmi for a change eg in law that materially affects epmis business but does not adversely affect cdwrs ability to make payments to epmi for example a new ca law that requires sellers into ca to turn over all their books and records to the cpuc further as we anticipated he said cdwr was not willing to be on the hook for a termination payment for an event outside its control such as a ferc change or federal legislation that adversely affects us however he did say that cdwr might entertain a no ld walk right for epmi if such a change adversely affected it my sense is that ultimately pirogcdwr will back track on that since such a change could occur when our contract is heavily in the money to cdwr and this would allow us an out without paying lds early walk provision he reiterated that cdwr would not extend the option with respect to the early walk away right that has been offered it was discussed that this could be structured in such a way that epmi could walk from the deal without receiving or paying a termination payment up until a date certain september one and september three zero were mentioned by me as possibilities although pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window our request is based on the gloomy news that has been eminating from the ca treasurers office about the bond issue provided that if the bonds were issued earlier than that the walk away right would terminate that is epmi would not be free to walk if cdwr was able to issue bonds with an investment grade rating prior to the drop dead date termination payment due date pirog said cdwr cannot shorten it from one eight zero days he said all other suppliers have lived with that pirog is sympathetic to our concerns but said that the bond guys are already nervous about only having one eight zero days if they had to issue bonds to pay the lds suspension of delivery emphasizing our concern with the one eight zero days i requested that cdwr provide some flexibility on our right to suspend perfromance in the event of an event of default and perhaps some other events such as a bond downgrade pirog said he thought cdwr could work with us on that downgrade not a default cdwr was not willing to have a bond downgrade an event of default however he said cdwr would be willing to consider having a downgrade event a no ld walk right for epmi and perhaps an event justifying epmi in suspending deliveries in other words a downgrade event would be treated like an event of default but no termination payment would be owed and epmi would have the flexibility to suspend performance pirog also discussed adding a covenant that cdwr would attempt to secure a credit rating with respect to the claims paying ability of the fund in the event that no bonds were issued that is if no bonds were outstanding and the fund did not have an investment grade rating we could terminate but without lds cross defaults this clearly is one of cdwrs hot buttons and we will not be able to get this is my sense however when asked about the idea of a cross default out wout a termination payment he stated that he would like to discuss that further with cdwr ld calculation methodology pirog said it was very unlikely cdwr would accept our proposed language he said they are striving for consistency among contracts and said their proposal is viewed as more objective my sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general arbitration in general pirog did not have a problem except for the following a desire to limit it to contractual claims only ie no tort actions extracontractual disputes etc would be subject to it also holding hearings in new york city was not well received and a request was made that all three arbitrators be neutral i would think that the situs issue will be a big one for richard sanders in light of the political environment if a dispute were to arise my general sense however is that this is not a deal breaker for cdwr assignment in general he understood the nature of our changes on this issue and said they were reasonable although he caveated that on this issue as well they are looking for some consistency we were again asked if assignment back to the ious would be acceptable even though he knew what our reaction would be pirog offered to provide us sample language which we said we would look at we stated that conceptually this would be a difficult sell in light of the environment he did not elaborate on how stringent the assignment standards are in the other deals new govt charge pass throughs a pass through of some governmental charges was considered to be okay but he said our proposed language was too broad pirog offered to provide some examples of acceptable language on this he di agre howeve that if for example ca imposed an excess profits tax that it was fair for us to be protected from that legal opinions pirog did not think that a legal opinion from hawkins would be forthcoming although he did say that he would look into whether or not they would be providing one on the bonds also he said it was a possibility that the california attorney general would issue the opinion on the bonds so we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from hawkins realistically it likely will be very difficult to get this before we have to extend the option perhaps we can put in a covenant on cdwr to get us that before our walk right expires additional cdwr covenants pirog stated that the additional covenants we have requested are conceptually okay with him but need to be discussed internally with cdwr pro rata spread amortization pirog had not reviewed the idea of amortizing the credit amount over the four year term and said that he would run it by cdwr cdwr information pirog said he would follow up with cdwr on how often it plans to give suppliers financial information he was resisting our request for monthly information although i pointed out that we really only wanted information

resources this article was originally published wednesday new york dow joneswith rate hike negotiations at a standstill and forward supply talks in washington yielding nothing pge corps pcg regulated utility subsidiary pacific gas and electric co reiterated wednesday that it has virtually exhausted its financial resources we have been borrowing an average of one million per hour to pay for the power we deliver to californians utility president gordon smith said in a press release no company can continue to operate indefinitely under such conditions since may pge has spent about five billion more on electricity than it gets paid by its customers but about a third of that amount has been paid into a pge account for profits from the generators it still owns the generation profits which for now are kept separate from other revenues are expected to be used to pay down the utilitys debt pge and edison internationals eix southern california edison have said for two weeks that they could go bankrupt if they dont get a rate increase immediately almost all of the utilities bonds are recourse to the parent companies standard poors analysts said wednesday that the utilities bonds will be downgraded severely and immediately if a rate increase isnt agreed to this week todays sp conference call sends a message to governor davis and californias leadership that now is the time for action smith said the governor and the california public utilities commission ultimately will determine if pacific gas and electric company can continue to provide essential services to the one four million californians in pges service territory the states public utilities commission is scheduled to meet thursday on the issue and has listed on its agenda the possibility of increasing the utilities rates california gov gray davis state lawmakers and utility executives were also working on a deal those discussions were at a stalemate there were no talks wednesday davis spokesman steve maviglio said but the governor updated financial analysts that consumers are inevitably going to face a rate hike customers pay pge five four mwh for energy while sce gets six six mwh both companies are paid additionally for transmission and distribution the utilities have told davis that they need at least two zero mwh a rate increase of about two zero more for electricity but the governor wants to keep the increase to about one zero of rates sp analysts said a one zero increase wouldnt be enough to keep the utilities from defaulting but the governors office said an agreement wasnt likely to be reached soon theres not going to be a percentage deal announced maviglio said were going to ask for greater scrutiny of the utilities claims consumer groups dismissed the utilities talk of bankruptcy as crying wolf edison wouldnt have issued a dividend on preferred stock last week if they were going bankrupt said doug heller of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights but if they are really going bankrupt the state should let them heller said better a buyout than a bailout heller said theyre not going bankrupt but if they do the better outcome would be a public power system under deregulation their inefficiency it only gets worse also wednesday negotiations on longterm supply contracts with western us electricity suppliers ordered by the federal energy regulatory commission

dow jones company inc washington every energy executive in america would have liked a halfhour with vice president dick cheney as he fashioned the bush administrations national energy program enron corp chairman kenneth lay got it mr lay used the time to set out an eightpoint agenda intended among other things to head off price controls on wholesale electricity provide enron and other energy traders with unfettered access to the nations electricitytransmission system and remove regulatory obstacles to building new generating plants and power lines the energy plan president bush unveiled yesterday reflected many of those same priorities in an interview last week the vice president said he also met with other energy executives but mr lay was the only one he named mr cheney says he sought mr lays advice because enron has a different take than most energy companies indeed enron corp is a modern paradox it has transformed itself over the past one five years from a stodgy gaspipeline operator into the nations largest trader of gas and electricity and a formidable player in newer markets such as telecommunications services and emissionsreduction credits today its the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets yet as much as any company in the us it has cultivated close ties with government since the late one nine eight zero s the houstonbased company which was president george w bushs biggest corporate campaign donor has beefed up its lobbying staff boosted its political contributions and sought out friends in the world of politics now with mr bush in the white house it is in a unique position to see whether those efforts will pay off enrons lobbying blitz reflects one of the ironies of the era of deregulation just as government created immense telephone electric and gas monopolies early in the last century enron and other players feel they need the governments help in opening up those monopolies and gaining access to onceclosed markets in particular enron wants the federal energy regulatory commission to ensure that energy is deregulated on terms favorable to the company rather than having the nations transmission lines controlled by the utilities it wants those lines to provide open access for new entrants such as enron eager to buy and sell power mr lay is on a firstname basis with a halfdozen members of the bush cabinet and knows many senior white house staffers from their days in the texas governors mansion with mr bush before joining the administration both white house economist lawrence lindsey and us trade representative robert zoellick were on enrons advisory board which pays members an annual stipend of five zero zero zero zero under mr lay enron has donated nearly two million to mr bush during his political career since the start of the two zero zero zero campaign enron and its employees have contributed one three million to the bush presidential drive the republican party and the presidential inauguration says the center for responsive politics enron also accounted for four six one zero zero zero in contributions during mr bushs two runs for governor according to the center for public integrity mr lay who holds a doctorate in economics says all he wants from government is a fair shake enron supports candidates you believe in he says you believe in their value system you believe in their philosophy and you believe theyll do the right things as leaders but its clear that mr lay wants more than that from government for now he is focusing on ferc where he worked in the early one nine seven zero s when the agency was known as the federal power commission he hopes to make ferc his ally in beating back the power of utilities long dismissed as a regulatory backwater overseeing wholesale transactions by electric and gas utilities the commission has emerged as the chief navigator of the nations transition to a fully deregulated energy marketplace even before mr bush took office ferc had begun to rein in the market power of utilities in december ferc told the nations utilities that it wanted them to voluntarily surrender their highvoltage lines those that can dispatch electricity across state lines to independent grid operators such as those already in place in california and the northeast which would provide open access to the lines although it told the utilities to submit plans for doing so many of them have been reluctant to relinquish control of their lines to such independent organizations mr lay wants ferc to go further forcing the utilities to cede direct control of their lines he also is seeking rules that would end what he calls energy balkanization and create seamless interstate electricity markets enron is the biggest gas and electric company entirely dependent on the competitive side of the business says andre meade an analyst for commerzbank to the extent deregulation slows down their business slows down right now its a lucrative strategy enron typically targets tightly controlled markets just as they are opening up using its financial clout and riskmanagement savvy to gain a dominant market position in doing so it frequently portrays itself as an insurgent taking on entrenched interests in electricity for instance enron buys the output of generating plants sometimes days weeks or years before the power is actually produced using sophisticated weather data it determines the most lucrative market for the power finds a buyer and then arranges delivery via transmission lines owned by others it hedges its positions with other contracts its wholesale trading volume climbed five five for natural gas and more than doubled for electricity in the first quarter alone such growth pushed enrons wholesale energytrading

shown the kind of backbone enron wanted in a separate fight over telephone deregulation when he insisted on closely monitoring phone utilities to make sure they opened their networks to competitors for the second slot enron backed nora mead brownell a pennsylvania utility regulator she had come to enrons aid in one nine nine seven when she voted to block an electricitymarket restructuring plan backed by philadelphias utility and by gop gov tom ridge enron argued that the plan would have locked it out of the philadelphia market enron worked to raise ms brownells visibility by lobbying the house commerce committee to include her as an expert witness on energy issues and as a member of an informal advisory group say enron and congressional aides mr lay provided heavyweight support he says enron included ms brownells name on its priority list of a halfdozen prospective ferc nominees and when her candidacy ran into opposition from pennsylvania officials with bitter memories of her one nine nine seven decision mr lay says he phoned karl rove the white houses top political strategist to tell him that she was a strong force in getting the right outcome in pennsylvania a white house spokeswoman says that a number of individuals and industry groups weighed in in favor of ms brownell but she declined to name any ms brownell says she was unaware of any concerted enron campaign on her behalf she didnt ask the white house who had supported her because she says i didnt want to be beholden meanwhile enron was using its democratic contacts to strengthen its ties with linda breathitt a kentucky democrat on the commission earlier this spring the company hired two of former vice president al gores closest friends as lobbyists nashville lawyer charles bones and mr gores campaignfinance director johnny hayes both had come to know ms breathitt through democratic politics ms breathitt says she wasnt very familiar with enrons interests but that she accepted when mr hayes invited her to dinner at a washington restaurant in april to meet richard shapiro enrons managing director for government affairs everyone likes to get to know the ferc commissioners ms breathitt says adding that she always pays for her own meals enron has long played this kind of insiders game mr lay has been friendly with both democratic and republican administrations over the past two five years sharing time on the links with presidents bill clinton and gerald ford hes been a particularly close friend of the bush family in the late one nine eight zero s he ran thenvice president george hw bushs fundraising drives in texas after the younger bush became governor he appointed mr lay to run the influential governors business council mr lay also made enrons fleet of corporate jets available

pennsylvania gov ridge to support enrons plan to enter the philadelphia electricity market i am certain it will have a positive impact mr lay wrote mr lay says he hasnt sought mr bushs aid directly since mr bush won the presidency last month he talked with the president briefly at a houston benefit for the barbara bush foundation for family literacy on which mr lay serves as cochairman its not a matter of us going off hunting or fishing or sitting around and having drinks he says not all mr lays initiatives have been successful when mr bush reneged in march on a campaign pledge to fight global warming by requiring reductions in carbondioxide levels produced by burning hydrocarbons mr lay says he telephoned mr cheney to complain the scientific evidence although certainly not conclusive is pretty compelling that there could be a climatechange problem he says he told the vice president the administration should still look very seriously at it around the same time mr lay also called mr rove the white house political adviser to urge him to talk to fred krupp the head of the moderate environmental defense fund messrs krupp and rove spoke briefly but found little common ground later enron which has plans to add emission credits to the commodities it trades joined a coalition urging mandatory reductions in carbondioxide levels but enron saved its main lobbying push for mr cheneys energy task force in april mr lay met with the panels staff director andrew lundquist and later with mr cheney whom mr lay had come to know well when the vice president was chief of halliburton co a dallas construction company we built enron field together says mr lay referring to houstons new ballpark in both meetings say enron and white house officials mr lay presented a broad agenda for opening up the nations electrical system and used the gastransmission system as a point of comparison in both cases he argues pipelines and transmission lines should be like the federal highway system that offers easy access to all the cheney report uses similar language describing the electrical grid as the highway for interstate commerce in electricity as enron sought the report directs the energy secretary to determine by the end of the year whether it makes sense to establish a national grid and to identify bottlenecks in the transmission system as well as how to remove them an effort to make the grid national would enhance fercs power as enron has urged the report is mum on some enron concerns such as requiring utilities to join regional transmission organizations an idea strongly opposed by the utility industry a white house aide says the task force didnt want to get involved in such battles between industries as solid as its support in the white house has turned out to be enron is worried about the backlash against electricity deregulation in western states and possibly in new york should electricity rates surge this summer nevada repealed its

unveiled thursday by the bush administration would heavily reward many of the stalwarts of the old economy if congress enacts president bushs proposal the major winners would include big oil and gas companies coal producers and giant construction companies as well as labor unions energy experts said critics complained that the plan offers no more than modest incentives for firms specializing in renewable energy or energysaving technologies the story is the same for other interests such as mass transit that might have the potential to substantially change the way americans live and work but those left the most emptyhanded probably are consumers and business owners who held out hopes for a quick fix for high electricity gasoline and natural gas prices environmentalists and even property rights advocates also say they came away as losers the plans more than one zero zero recommendations are intended to encourage more domestic power production and the building of new oil refineries it envisions more than one three zero zero new power plants including nuclear facilities as well as more than three eight zero zero zero miles of pipelines and two six three zero zero zero miles of distribution lines the plan calls for opening alaskas arctic national wildlife refuge to exploration for oil and natural gas and some increased spending on research into cleanerburning technologies as a result the plan could stimulate hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in energy infrastructure said chris ellinghaus an energy analyst at williams capital group a new yorkbased investment banking firm ellinghaus sees that money going to not just the large energy companies such as exxon mobil corp and electricity producersincluding calpine reliant dynegy duke and mirantbut also

plan contributed two nine zero two zero nine for his presidential bid american petroleum institute president red cavaney acknowledged that members of his energyindustry trade group would be helped by the bush plan however he said such a plan by increasing production would help bring down energy priceswhich in turn would benefit consumers and industries that use large amounts of energy at the end of the day our members are helped when you have a healthy strong economy and their customers are doing well cavaney said labor unions see no losers in end bush administration opponents in organized labor offered only tepid criticism of the energy plan bill samuel legislative director for the national aflcio labor federation expressed concern that the bush plan pays too little attention to the immediate crisis faced by consumers in california and elsewhere but he said under any comprehensive energy plan to emerge from washington whether it is something resembling the bush plan or a democratic alternative i dont see any losers it would create jobs and muchneeded energy the teamsters for example would benefit from proposed pipeline construction in alaska likewise the united mine workers could win from increased coal production and an array of construction unions would profit from the building of new power plants and transmission systems californian consumers and businesses complained about the lack of relief from high electricity prices yet among the first to benefit from the plan would be power plant engineering companies an industry dominated by such californiabased companies as the southlands fluor corp parsons corp and jacobs engineering along with san franciscos bechtel corp mark stevens head of strategic planning at aliso viejobased fluor said he huddled with staff members thursday to figure out where the bush plan could mean increased business for the company in an initial glance we came up with three areas alaska coalfired cogeneration plants and conservation he said in alaska the company is already at work on frontend engineering for the planned natural gas pipeline that will bring gas from prudhoe bay to alberta canada despite the warm rhetoric from the white house the renewable energy industries generally consider themselves big losers in the plan while extending the production tax credit to wind and biomass technologies the administration refused to do the same for geothermal or solar power when you look at the net pluses and minuses weve gotten recognition and some nice rhetoric but the substance is still severely lacking said karl gawell executive director of the geothermal energy assn an industry trade group he said most of the ideas the task force looked atfrom promoting the use of renewable energies by government facilities to adopting a production tax cut for solar and geothermalwere left on the cutting room floor the energy departments research and development budget for renewables was cut five zero in bushs budget request and the industry was disappointed that the plan did not include a commitment to restore or increase federal investment to help level the playing field between renewables and other energy sources i think that is unfortunate because the area facing the most severe energy problems is the far west california oregon washington nevada and idaho are all facing severe problems right now gawell said these are states unlikely to build nuclear power plants these states dont have coal but these states have a wealth of renewable resources missing chapter on climate change from the standpoint of environmentalists the key issue was the plans silence on carbon dioxide emissions and global warming the united states has made international commitments to reduce its emissions of carbon dioxide onethird of which come from power plants were still looking for the missing chapter on climate change said jeremy symons of the national wildlife federation rather than producing a plan to shrink emissions the president is putting out a plan that locks in a pathway of everincreasing greenhouse emissions a cabinetlevel commission is reviewing the bush administration policy on global warming but environmentalists said the energy report signals that no serious effort will be made to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases the auto industry might get a boost from the plans provision for tax credits for purchasing hybridpowered cars and trucks but not soon the benefits will go to relatively few consumers at the start silverstein and rivera
