report all is not lost ap photodave weaver ounu locker room report all is not lost by james hale date oct two nine two zero zero one the streak is over but the season isnt james hale talks with the oklahoma coaches a day after their two zero one zero to nebraska make no bones about it oklahoma is not down and out over their loss to nebraska sure they disappointed but oklahoma is still oklahoma and they know that it took everything that nebraska had to beat them on their home field the sooner coaches feel very good about how they played in the game they knew going in that it was going to be incredibly tough to win the game in lincoln but without question felt they could have done so in fact now knowing what they know they felt they should have won the game the game was a tight fit so it turned on a couple of plays ou was very confident and very much alive with eight five four to play in the fourth quarter in fact ou head coach bob stoops was so confident in his defense that he decided to pooch kick a punt from tim duncan down inside the five instead of going for a five three yard field goal now hindsight is twentytwenty but stoops said he would do it again considering how we were playing defensively i would probably pooch it again stoops said sunday afternoon following the game now that i know what happened i keep wrestling with that decision but i like our defense so much that i am sure that nine times out of ten i would pooch it down there and tell our defense to go get the ball i have a lot of confidence in tim duncan and know that he can make a five three yarder but if he doesnt we lose field position and i just thought it was better we tried to pin them down hey give them credit eric crouch makes a big play on the option and then they beat us on the trick play things like that happen in a good football game eric crouchs one nine yard gain was a gamesaver for the huskers crouch was totally held in check before he finally breaks one off the right tackle to get the huskers off their goal line however at that point the sooners were still in good shape before gamesaver number two occurred we have them stuffed right there at the nebraska three two but we get called for the inadvertent facemask said codefensive coordinator brent venables that is just a bad break on our part we stuff the play just like we had stuffed him the whole game but we get a penalty and they keep the drive alive we played great defense on that series think about it we let them off the goal line but we hold our poise and stuff them the next three downs bingo we should be getting the football back with a little over five minutes remaining in fairly good field position as it is we get the penalty and then get burned on the trick play thats football but because of the way it happened we are not discouraged how we played at all for nine seven percent of the game oklahomas defense was outstanding roy williams and rocky calmus were flying around the ball and brandon everage was doing a great job in run and pass coverage it took two cornhuskers on most plays to block freshman sensation tommie harris and in the fourth quarter harris was stronger than any husker offensive lineman where the sooners lost this game was in their lack of playmaking offensive on offense and special teams i cant believe i am saying the sooners lost this game on special teams but on this rare occasion nebraska had the better special team play they made more plays than us in the end than we did and that made the difference said stoops we had our opportunities that we didnt come through and convert on the reverse pass is wide open and we have a chance to go ahead one four one zero but again we throw a bad ball and dont convert then we had some drops in the second half and missed some opportunities for some big plays on fade routes we have come up with those kinds of receptions before however we werent able to do it against nebraska i felt in the kicking game that their punting game got the better of ours when both teams punt one zero times there is a lot of exchanging there and i felt they had better field position in the end that coupled with two turnovers hurt us because in tight games that makes a difference again they made more plays than us and won the game the lack of production out of the wide receivers continues to be the big story offensively granted the quarterbacking has been up and down but if the sooner wide receivers played like they did a year ago then the quarterbacks would look a lot better first let me point out that nothing has changed at the sooner practices the wide receivers catch the same amount of footballs that they caught last year wide receiver coach steve spurrier jr is doing the same outstanding job he did a year ago and it is basically the same guys however you have to factor in they lost of andre woolfolk and the fact that mark clayton is the only wide receiver that is stepping up on a consistent basis woolfolk did not play one snap on offense but did an outstanding job on defense clayton once again played well coming up with six two yards on six catches norman also had a solid game with four catches for four eight yards however where is curtis fagan and antwone savage savage had two catches for three five yards but both juniors are not getting open enough or making big plays we had some opportunities slip through our hands literally slip through our hands said offensive coordinator mark mangino its obvious on the plays that we are talking about that we had our hands on the ball and just didnt haul them in we are not asking our wide receivers to make any plays they didnt make last year but right now we are not getting the same production however let me point out that they are not totally problem our quarterbacks are not always finding the right receiver in their progressions and many times the quarterback is having a defender right in his face because our oline didnt do a good enough job it takes one one guys to make an offense work and one one to break it down at right tackle the sooners alternated jerod fields and jammal brown and both gave a solid account of themselves they played right tackle by committee and i think we will keep it that way said mangino both played well enough to give us a chance to have success and that is about all we can hope for right now right now both cant play an entire game by themselves so we are going to play both of them and both have potential to be very good offensive linemen bob stoops says that starting quarterback jason white has a sprained knee and that he will miss the tulsa game but he has a chance to be back for texas am white was getting xrayed sunday and reports indicate that the knee injury is a torn acl and that white will attempt to play on it if he can stand the pain this situation is very similar to ou defensive back terrance simms knee injury that occurred early in the season simms attempted to comeback after sitting out one game and and reinjured the knee in the fourth quarter of his first game back which has forced him to sit out the rest of the season what you hope is that there is nothing more to whites knee injury and he can come back in two weeks its another opportunity for nate hybl to get something going at quarterback the coaches seemed pleased with hybls performance against nebraska and he did look good in the first half in the second half he struggled against the nebraska pressure and his wide receivers didnt catch the ball on some nicely thrown fades there is no question that the team has total confidence in white and they would like to feel the same way about hybl for that to happen hybl needs to deliver some big throws most of the national media at the game believes that ou and nebraska are two of the top four programs in the country all believe that florida and miami belong with the big one two s top two big two all believe that ou and nebraska will battle again in the big one two championship game and if the sooners win they will still have a great shot to play for the national championship the projected bcs poll tomorrow is nebraska miami ou and florida with texas fifth one final point bob stoops and his football team handled the loss with great class stoops was great at the postgame press conference and won over many national friends he was intelligent funny and right to the point with his answers mike stoops brent venables and mark mangino were the same all were dressed very well handled themselves very well and were total class the sooner players answered every question and despite the fact they were hurting inside really won over the national media this ou program is all about doing things the right away and that was never more evident than in their first loss in two zero games,08:45:03,No

renewable energy could be achieved more cheaply using other technologies the report does acknowledge that government subsidies for fully commercialized fossil energy technologies oil coal and natural

aggregation in Northeast Ohio,at our last meeting we identified several impediments to participating in the aggregation programs in northeast ohio they included the uncertainty of the shopping credit and the requirement for load following on five zero zero six zero zero megawatts of capacity in cleveland and possibly two zero zero zero megawatts in norheast ohio where we have no generating capacity and no pool exists at the conclusion of the meeting we decided to try and find out if there are other serious nonohio affiliated bidders out there before we took more aggressive measures on why municipal aggregation doesnt work i have spoken to george pofok at cleveland public power who stated that he has spoken to one two power marketers and one power broker he has received a number of bids below the shopping credit from suppliers who are both affiliates and nonaffiliates he said that about three or four of the bidders have voiced concerns about getting firm transmission service into fe once the power reaches fe under the ohio settlement they will treat it like their own native load an equal number of marketers have also expressed concern about the load following issue pofoks view is that without generation in the region it will be difficult to play in this market he noted that in three four years orion will be a major player once the buyback is completed further he believes that the problem is not as much one of insufficient generation as it is of insufficient transmission and that paper solutions will not solve the problem jeff and i will be meeting with him to discuss transmission issues pofok is also chairman of the board of ampoh our competitors who are proposingbuilding capacity in ohio include cogentrix dominion dpl energy dresden duke entergy ohio national energy and pge national energy group with regard to aggregation in fe service territory i see three options which are as follows one do not compete in that market for aggregated load two reconsider building generating capacity in the fe service territory three bid on aggregation and take the risk for balancing or sign a network operating agreement with respect to the third option preliminarily it appears that under fes regs if you dont have power within a control areas control you have to sign a network agreement i am in the process of obtaining that agreement to see if that gets us over the hurdle since if we signed the network agreement we would not have to worry about load following depending of course on the price point to point is only available to retail customers taking service at six nine kv and above the other point with regard to balancing is that under the fe settlement as long as the system is balanced within eight eight mw there is no penalty a payment of the cost to the utility would be required if the system was out of balance by more than eight eight mw based on fes lsub one zero limit and our contribution to the system was in the same direction as the imbalance cash out is at market price with no penalties market price is calculated as the incremental cost to fe to buy the power if we are short or the sale price if we are long penalties attach if there is a pattern of frequently being out of balance under the fe agreement we would schedule a day ahead but could change that schedule up to twenty minutes before each hour which should help manage the risk of getting into an imbalance situation this is very close to how we managed the deal we did behind duquesne one other issue i am looking into is ancillary services it appears in the alliance rto filing that the intention is to require suppliers to pay for ancillary services associated with retail services whereas the utilities would not in the fe supplier tariffs it indicates we must pay for transmission and ancillaries but in the retail tariffs unbundling service the transmission and ancillary charges are broken out and appear to be included in the cost the customer pays the utility minus the shopping credit i asked rick hornsby of tabors and associates to look at this to see if there is a double counting or an argument that could be made to keep suppliers and customers from paying the same charge twice he concurred that there appears to be a double counting i have written up an argument on this which is being included in a pleading we are filing today and am also talking to staffers about it this would improve the economics of any aggregation deal we might do as soon as i get the network agreement i will let you know please let me know your thoughts about how we ought to proceed janine,06:36:00,"Yes

zero one two zero montana powertwo zero problems continue to overshadow transformation into touch america by will mcnamara director electric industry analysis news item from cbs marketwatch montana power shares fell on nov one six a da y after the utility posted a loss for its third quarter citing the slowdow n in the economy and the companys transition from a diversified energy com pany to a standalone telecommunications firm the stock fell to a five two week low of four zero five earlier in the session it closed nov one six at four one eight down five two ce nts as of early morning trading on nov one nine montana power shares remained at four one eight two zero analysis there is little doubt that montana power currently finds itself a t a challenging crossroads the company remains in the midst of becoming so lely a telecommunications operation having sold off much of its utility ho ldings however the process has hit several snags including an incomplete transfer of its transmission and distribution unit to northwestern corp c ompounding montana powers current problems is a weakened financial perform ance which continues to worsen and also leaves little capital to build the telecom business in addition the company faces a host of related challen ges including uncertainty about the final regulatory approval needed for t he asset sale to northwestern requests for rate increases to fund the purc hase of power that montana power must buy on the wholesale market and insp ection of the longterm powerpurchase contracts that the company has forme d with various suppliers the question that investors should be asking with regard to montana powers current plight is whether or not the financial l osses and resulting drop in stock price represent a temporary setback or so me larger indication of doubt about the companys viability as a telecom op erationtwo zero for its third quarter two zero zero one montana power posted a loss of two seven five million o r two six cents a share representing a five seven three million swing from its three q two zero zero zero pro fit of three zero four million or two nine cents a share during the third quarter of two zero zero zero montana power had reported a net income of three one three million montana power h as noted that the losses in the current quarter were not solely related to touch america but also included a one four eight million pretax writedown of inve stments in two other telecommunications companies one had filed for bankru ptcy and the other defaulted on loans that montana power had helped guarant ee in addition company officials have attributed the loss to price decrea ses and the slowing economy however note that the current thirdquarter l osses followed losses in the second quarter as well specifically the comp any reported a net loss of one zero nine million or one one cents a share in the two q two zero zero one compared with net income of three five five million or three four cents a share in the second quarter of two zero zero zero the company also previously reduced its expectation s of revenue growth in two zero zero one to one zero percent from two five percent according to mon tana powers ceo bob gannon the company is merely experiencing a shortte rm liquidity problemtwo zero nevertheless to say that montana power is having some growing pains is an understatement since march two zero zero zero it has been montana powers goal to total ly divest all of its energy assets and reemerge as a debtfree communicati ons company operating under the name of touch america presently the compa nys telecom subsidiary with zero debt three five zero million in cash and two six zero zero zero m iles of fiber communications lines ceo gannon originally envisioned and c ontinues to see touch america as one of the largest broadband companies in the country and a more lucrative business model than the formerly integrat ed montana power much of the transition has already taken place consideri ng that montana power has successfully divested its oil and gas coal and i ndependent power production businesses as noted the last piece of the puz zle is the sale of its electric and naturalgas utility operations to north western corp a provider of electricity naturalgas and communications se rvices to midwestern customers this is a big piece of the puzzle however as touch america is counting on proceeds from the distribution sale to sup port continued growthtwo zero therein lies one of the main challenges for montana power the montana publ ic service commission is the last regulatory agency that needs to approve t he sale of these assets some analysts have suggested that montana powers financial problems can be resolved only if the montana public service commi ssion approves the sale of the electric and naturalgas distribution system s which could inject some four six zero million in touch americas operations yet state regulators are ensuring that the state consumer counsels office wh ich represents ratepayers in utility cases and a group of large industrial electricity users also have an opportunity to raise any concerns about the proposed sale of the assets the less time provided for equalopportunity review and comment could increase the likelihood that the sale could be cha llenged down the linetwo zero after some early deliberation the montana public service commission has no w agreed to review the one one billion proposed sale of the assets to northwes tern corp by jan three one two zero zero two although lawyers for montana power are still l obbying to have this review moved up to december part of the pressure for the review the companys attorneys have argued is that if the sale is not approved by the end of the year investors and lenders may lose patience r egarding the uncertainty of the deal and refuse to provide any further capi tal support into the growing touch america furthermore the viability of t he entire business plan for touch america could be brought into question if this asset sale is not approved by state regulators considering that mont ana power is counting on proceeds from the sale to support growth of the ne w telecom company the sales agreement between montana power and northweste rn corp expires march three one two zero zero two so time is also a factortwo zero another issue that has yet to be resolved is montana powers intent to rais e rates to support purchases of wholesale power in other words as a tange ntial issue related to the sale of its assets state regulators also questi on how montana power will recover certain powersupply costs as it continue s to morph into a telecom business the company has established that it exp ects to pay nearly two billion over the next three zero years for wholesale power pu rchases that have been necessitated by its transition to a telecom company from a utility holding company and hopes to increase electric rates by two zero percent to support these expenses montana power is still considered the de fault provider to about two eight eight zero zero zero customers and needs an average of six seven zero mw f or its customers however the company also needs to keep a total of one zero five zero mw as a peak load during the winter months and aims to keep one zero zero mw of reser ve powertwo zero since the company voluntarily divested its own generation facilities to ppl corp it must procure its entire load on the open market at rates set by the montana public service commission the two zero percent rate increase reporte dly would increase residential electricity rates by about two zero zero a month sta rting in july two zero zero two making the average bill about six four per month in additio n to the projected two zero percent increase for residential customers montana p ower estimated that small businesses could see their rates increase by two one p ercent and medium industrial customers could see a three six percent increase it is important to note that a recent survey by the great falls tribune conclu ded that the increase in montana powers rates would produce some of the h ighest residential electric rates in the northwesttwo zero montana power is attempting to establish longterm power contracts with sup pliers to meet its entire load requirements for instance montana power fo rmed a buyback agreement with ppl as a condition of the generation sale tw o years ago this contract expires july one two zero zero two beyond that date montana power announced that it signed a oneyear contract to buy one one one mw from duke energy at an undisclosed price ppl also has formed a new contract to provi de four five zero mw to montana power over a fiveyear period after its current contra ct expires northwestern power the purchaser of montana powers distributi on system has said that it wants montana power to assemble a diverse packa ge of powerpurchase deals instead of buying all its load from one source to encourage the development of new generation sources in the region mont ana power has reportedly submitted a portfolio of powerpurchase deals to t he montana public service commission to determine the inclusion of those de als within the rate structure and the portfolio contains about threefourt hs of the one one two nine mw that montana power will need to cover its peak demand of customers and maintain an adequate reserve the company will probably purc hase the balance of its requirements on the shortterm markettwo zero also on the legal front montana power continues to navigate through at le ast two litigious proceedings first in august a group of montana power s hareholders initiated a lawsuit against the utility claiming the companys effort to get out of the electricity business was illegal and cost them three billion in lost stock value the complaint filed in the district court at butte said the sale of montana power generation plants to ppl montana in december one nine nine nine was done without the required shareholder approval and should be overturned the suit also asks for a court order putting the plants and an estimated one zero zero million in profits realized by ppl from operating the pl ants into a trust until the case is resolved what this means is that the s ale of montana powers generation assets are in a state of litigation even though the sale of the generation assets was completed two years ago anot her lawsuit is related to montana powers two zero zero million purchase last year o f qwest communications longdistance and other telephone businesses within a one four state service area essentially montana power has launched a suit ag ainst qwest alleging that qwest has violated antitrust laws and constrain ed competition in the longdistance and voice and data markettwo zero consequently as montana power closes out the year and hits the twoyear ma rk in its transformation into touch america the future for the company loo ks rather questionable although there are market doubts about the future o f the telecom sector montana power remains confident that its longterm pr ospects as a telecom company remain very strong nevertheless the current question for investors is how quickly and how successfully montana can comp lete its transformation into touch america in other words what montana po wer sees on the horizon may not be so easily reached the path to the compa nys final destination is obviously marked by several financial and legal o bstaclestwo zero an archive list of previous

Approach to California,states outlays for electricity may be hard to recover without a rate hike by rebecca smith mitchel benson and john r emshwiller staff reporters of the wall street journal sacramento calif earlier this year gov gray davis made what may be the biggest bet in the history of the nations biggest state that he could tame an outofcontrol electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without busting the states budget antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own political career his wager is still on the table but the assumptions that underlie it are looking increasingly shaky these days the governor has already spent around two billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power taking over the role formerly played by the states nearbankrupt electric utilities and california will probably be obliged to spend billions more before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to some semblance of financial health under the governors plan california aims to recoup the money it is using to buy electricity by issuing one zero billion in bonds that way it would still have a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads schools and other public services but theres a potentially big obstacle to this plan the state legislature worried about racking up billions in new debt has put limits on the size of any bond offering in broad terms the legislatures action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can recover annually from utility customers right now that doesnt appear to be much under the current rate structure essentially set in place by californias flawed one nine nine six electricityderegulation plan consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the wholesale market preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to the california public utilities commission show the states share of the proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as two four one million not enough to support even one billion in bond sales under the legislatures formula that would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already paid for power not to mention the billions more gov davis will need to spend that in turn raises the prospect that californias economy and its credit rating both could deteriorate significantly but state finance officials say that based on their own projections they will be able to extract enough money to support a one zero billion bond issue walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival mr davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers if i wanted to raise rates i could solve this problem in two zero minutes mr davis says the governor says he believes that the state can obtain enough affordable power through longterm powersupply contracts to avoid the need for a big rate increase the billions of dollars the state hopes to borrow would be used to help pay for power until electricity prices drop as they are expected to do when new power plants come online over the next few years the davis administration fears that what may be its only other option a big increase in retail electric rates could prompt angry consumer groups to seek new electricity laws through a statewide ballot initiative during next years election thats when mr davis is expected to run for a second term as governor but trying to save california without rate increases is forcing mr davis to make some colossal gambles with the states money state officials estimate that in the next several months california will need to spend as much as six billion on power purchases equivalent to the states entire fiscal surplus mr davis is also looking to spend several billion more to buy the transmission assets of three investorowned utilities in order to restore two of them to creditworthiness he also has announced plans to spend several hundred million dollars more on conservation programs designed to reduce demand while new power plants are being built in the state in order to limit the states financial exposure in the meantime the governor and his aides have in some cases ignored state law they have threatened appointed officials who have stood in the way and they have sharply restricted the flow of information to the public none of those steps is expected to do much to reduce state spending on power in the coming months in a few weeks power usage is expected to begin a sharp seasonal rise as californians switch on their air conditioners with the coming of warmer weather by various estimates demand during peak periods this summer could outstrip supply by one zero or several thousand megawatts that could produce more rolling blackouts like the ones that hit northern california earlier this year it is also likely to put strong upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices steven zimmerman managing director of standard poors corp says mr davis and his aides dont have a lot of time to put a cap on the states financial exposure to the crisis the creditrating agency has put the state on credit watch for a possible downgrade which would affect the value of all of californias outstanding public debt moodys investor service inc is also concerned it said in a recent report that the power crisis could soon seriously threaten the health of the states economy mr davis a democrat and career politician was dealt a bad hand when he took office in one nine nine nine the deregulation plan that sparked the states electricity crisis was enacted under his predecessor republican pete wilson but mr davis was slow to react to early signs of trouble this past summer and alarms sounded by members of the state legislature by the time mr davis finally sprang into action earlier this year a troublesome powersupply squeeze had escalated into a crisis in a jan one seven declaration of emergency the governor designated the state department of water resources to take the utilities place as the daily buyer of huge quantities of electricity his hope that by making the state the dominant player in californias power sector he would ease electricity producers concerns about getting paid and give the state enough clout to negotiate lower longterm power prices squeaky summer earlier this week mr davis announced final or tentative agreements with two zero power suppliers to furnish the state with a total of eight nine zero zero megawatts for periods of as long as two zero years but the supply situation remains extremely uncertain for this summer when demand probably will top four five zero zero zero megawatts if the state can secure enough power under contract and push down demand through aggressive conservation it might be able to squeak through the summer season if not it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power in the cash market under deregulation retail electric rates were frozen for several years while wholesalepower costs were free to fluctuate when the plan was conceived wholesale prices were low and expected to go lower however a combination of unexpected growth in power demand and a lack of new generating capacity helped produce a supply squeeze average wholesale prices more than tripled last year from one nine nine nine and in january those prices were up one zero fold from a year earlier by then californias two biggest investorowned utilities the pacific gas electric unit of pge corp and the southern california edison subsidiary of edison international faced imminent financial collapse they had racked up billions of dollars in wholesale power bills they couldnt afford to pay as generators began shying away from selling to the two utilities the clinton administration forced them to sell power into the california market an order left in place during the first weeks of the bush administration still northern california was hit by rolling blackouts on several days in early january learning by doing since then the dwr which does some electricity trading as an adjunct to its main mission of managing the states giant system of aqueducts and reservoirs has had to learn the ins and outs of power markets on the run it hasnt been easy david mills tradingfloor manager for the federal bonneville power administration says the water agency has at times offered to pay five zero to one zero zero per megawatt hour more than the available market price they agree to prices that make you wonder says mr mills whose organization markets electricity from federal dams in the pacific northwest youd at least think theyd check to see what the prevailing price is before throwing out their offer mr mills says that to cut california some slack he occasionally has instructed his traders to sell at prices lower than the dwr had offered to pay ray hart the water agency deputy director responsible for the power purchasing says he isnt aware of any cases in which the dwr has overpaid he says his team has been extremely successful by all measures ultimately the dwrs trading acumen is far less important than the overall arithmetic of power supply and demand in california with the price of natural gas that feeds many of the regions generating plants at near record levels and some suppliers reluctant to sell into the troubled california market wholesale electric prices remain stubbornly high and in recent days have again been rising the legislature has advanced the dwr about three billion from the states general fund for power purchases under emergency legislation passed by the legislature and signed by mr davis on feb one the general fund is to be reimbursed from a planned bond sale later this year but under terms of the emergency law the water agency would have to wrest two five billion a year in revenue from retail electricity rates in order to sell the one zero billion worth of bonds sought by mr davis assembly speaker robert hertzberg a southern california democrat says the formula was created to ensure that there would be a way to repay the bonds without draining the states coffers we didnt want to just open our wallets he says according to the language of the feb one law the water agency gets whats left of revenue collected from ratepayers after the utilities pay certain of their own powersupply bills and other expenses and in their filings with the puc last month the utilities reckoned under their worstcase scenarios that there would be only two four one million available to the dwr this year changing the formula state officials are quietly pushing the puc to rejigger the formula so that the water department gets more money even though that would clash with terms of the feb one law robert miyashiro deputy director of the department of finance says the emergency law was drafted poorly and has led people to believe the dwr only gets the leftover money he predicts there will be cleanup legislation at the request of the davis administration the puc is considering a plan to use a different revenuesharing formula than the one in the state law the proposed new formula was written in close consultation with mr daviss finance department says puc president loretta lynch who supports the initiative and is hoping to rush it through the effort has drawn some opposition commissioner richard bilas at a recent puc meeting questioned the legality of the commission attempting to change a formula set by the legislature pge is even more emphatic since the dwrs extra money could come at the utilitys expense the formula threatens to undo the very financial protections for the utilities that the new law attempted to provide the utility said in a recent filing with the puc balking at buying as politicians and regulators wrestle with that issue the davis administration has taken a step to reduce the outflow of state cash that also seems to conflict with the feb one law it was widely assumed that the law required the dwr to buy any electricity the state needed to keep its lights on however on many occasions the dwr has refused to buy power on the grounds that it was too expensive citing a portion of the new law that urges the agency to hold down costs the task of covering any remaining shortfall has passed to the california independent system operator which manages the states energy grid and is charged with buying power when necessary to avert shortages however the iso doesnt have any powerpurchasing money of its own and the major parties it would normally bill are pge and edison whose inability to pay their power bills was the reason the state started buying electricity in the first place amid criticism of its stance from generators utilities and wall street the dwr says it has started covering more of the utilities electricity costs the water agency is now buying nine five to nine nine of what california needs in a given day says the agencys mr hart but increased buying only adds to the uncertainty about the eventual tab the states legislative analyst elizabeth hill recently recommended that lawmakers hold off considering more than two billion in state spending on items ranging from college construction to beach cleanups because of continuing questions about the financial impact of the electricity crisis like others ms hill complains that the governors office and state agencies havent been forthcoming with information indeed the dwr refuses to say precisely how much power it is purchasing and at what prices though it has on several occasions gone back to the legislature for more money state officials say that data on its purchasing activities would give suppliers an advantage in continuing electricitysupply contract talks state controller kathleen connell who is running for mayor of los angeles in an april election recently announced plans to post state powerspending information on her departments web site but within two four hours ms connell suspended that plan after discussions with senior davis administration officials i feel very strongly that this information should be publicly released says ms connell i just dont want to do anything that would weaken the states effectiveness in negotiating in an effort to more tightly control events the governor obtained legislative approval to abolish the two six member iso board which was made up of everyone from utility executives to representatives of consumer groups he then appointed a new fivemember board to ensure a quick transition the california attorney general threatened the old board members with fines of as much as five zero zero zero each if they didnt immediately relinquish their positions all did i was offended at the heavyhanded treatment says karen johanson a former iso board member one of the first acts of the isos new board was to close a meeting about the electricity crisis the former iso board routinely held such meetings in public iso attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to keeping its deliberations as open as possible the wall street journal and other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in sacramento state

reviews is tannin wine writers never seem to tire of references to round tannins ripe tannins smooth tannins tough tannins gentle tannins and supple tannins it begins to seem that if you dont understand tannin you dont understand wine especially red wine so just what the hell is a tannin tannins are organic compounds in plants trees roots and bark or in the case of wine skins seeds and stems tastewise tannin doesnt impart a flavor but a texture in concentrated quantities it sticks to the inside of your mouth where it creates a puckering sensation a sensory effect that senior winecom merchant tim gaiser likens to that of overbrewed tea tannin is astringent gaiser explains if a wine has too much of it its out of balance but tannin isnt a bad thing its a necessary component for wine to have structure and aging potential in other words the more tannin a wine has the better it will age not necessarily if a wine has a lot of tannin that isnt balanced by adequate fruit and acidity it wont age well says gaiser eventually the fruit will fade leaving nothing but tannin balance is the key winemakers and vineyard managers can control tannin in several ways ripeness of grapes dramatically affects the level and quality of tannins says gaiser wines made from grapes that arent fully ripe often have green stemmy hard tannins ripe tannins are finer and rounder tasting in other words supple given a suitable climate ripeness and its corollary flavor development results from such factors as low vineyard yields and long growing seasons which allow extended hangtime for the fruit tannin quality also depends on the amount of time that a winemaker leaves fermenting grape juice must in contact with the skins a process referred to as maceration one of the main reasons california cabernets have gotten so much better in the last one zero years is that longer maceration times have been used gaiser says whats improved more than anything is texture which speaks specifically to tannin management in bordeaux and california cabernet maceration times commonly last three weeks or longer a period that enables tannins to grow rounder and gentler tannin isnt usually associated with white wines because they dont undergo maceration theyre pressed off the skins right away almost all red grape varieties contain clear juice so the color of red wine is attributable solely to extended skin contact but some white wines do gain tannin from the new oak barrels in which theyre aged a lot of oaky chardonnays are just as tannic as red wines gaiser points out people dont usually take that into account which is why chardonnay can be so difficult to pair with food click here to try our studies in contract sampler tannin in red wine

two zero zero zero california utilities losseson electricity pose risk by rebecca smith staff reporter of the wall street journal californias two biggest utilities are losing so much money buying electricity in the states deregulated market that they have run up deficits equivalent to half their net worth in just four months if the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the price these utilities are allowed to bill their customers as currently seems likely they could become technically insolvent sometime next year that would put pressure on regulators to orchestrate a multibilliondollar public bailout similar to the too big to fail response that in the past pushed governments to rescue banks such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bondrating concerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks for pacific gas electric co a unit of san franciscobased pge corp and southern california edison a unit of edison international of rosemead calif bond rating concerns say they arent sure how much additional debt can be borne by the two affected utilities before they will have difficulty paying their bills probe of california power prices begins but new plants arent seen as solution sept one one los angeles utility is benefitting surprisingly from deregulation sept six california lawmakers vote to limit electricity costs sept one if this is just a seasonal aberration the utilities can get through it says lori woodland analyst for fitch ibca if it goes on for six or nine months its a very serious situation adds aj sabatelle senior credit officer at moodys investors service inc at some point you have a financial crisis the utilities say they are having no difficulty meeting expenses and dont envision problems in servicing their debts but they are vigorously lobbying state and federal regulators to change the rules of the game hoping somehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall the california utilities experience may be a harbinger of what could happen in other states where wholesale power prices have surpassed the amount that utilities are allowed to charge their ratepayers for now utilities are making ends meet by going to the financial markets to borrow money pge a giant utility that serves one out of every two zero americans is seeking approval to increase its debt capacity by one four billion it is borrowing two zero zero million while edison is tapping two five zero million from the commercial paper market this is going to be a long tough road says jim scilacci chief financial officer for southern california edison todays situation represents a complete turnabout from what was expected when california deregulated its energy market on march three one one nine nine eight which opened electricity pricing to competition california tried to give its utilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulating faster than other states and by creating a mechanism to allow investorowned utilities such as pge and edison to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customers under the old regulatory system to do this the state legislature set retail rates at high levels which at first generated fat surpluses for the utilities as the money piled up utilities used it to pay down debts for generation facilities that were otherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world by the end of this june pge and edison together had collected more than one two billion and were on track to finish paying down debts well ahead of the march three one two zero zero two deadline set by the legislature at that point rate freezes were to end and retail prices were to fluctuate with the market but all that went out the window in june when wholesale power prices surged topping the rates the utilities were allowed to charge retail customers average prices at statesanctioned energy markets were four to five times the prices of a year earlier and three to four times the level utilities could charge customers the accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at pge that analysts expect its deficit to exceed three billion by oct three one more than half its shareholder equity of five seven billion which is defined as assets minus liabilities southern california edison finished august with a deficit of two billion equivalent to almost twothirds its net worth of three two billion the utilities though they have been accumulating deficits arent required to report these as losses on their earnings statements that leaves utilities in a bind they want to end the rate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost of electricity to consumers but should the freeze end before the statutory deadline of two zero zero two they get clobbered that is because they will immediately have to book a loss on their powerpurchase deficits whats more they cant use the proceeds from planned powerplant sales to cover those losses instead should the freeze end they will be obliged to refund some of the proceeds to ratepayers in pges case the refunds could total five zero zero million while in edisons case the amount is two five four million publicly at least utility executives insist a mechanism will be found to let them recoup the money spent on electricity consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight nettie hoge executive director for san francisco consumer group utility reform network says ratepayers shouldnt end up footing the bill for a deal cut by utilities that benefited them before prices shot up utility executives are now distancing themselves from the legislation that got them into such a mess which was drafted with their assistance pge chairman robert glynn says it is best not to overanalyze the old deal instead he says regulators and legislators should sit down with utilities and construct a new agreement since its in the broad interests of the state not to have critical energy infrastructure look like a leper mr glynn says the current deal offers mutually assured destruction to both utilities and ratepayers something must be done he says or consumers throughout most of the state will experience a san diegostyle rate shock the utility serving that city san diego gas electric co ended its freeze a year ago and began passing wholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers legislators intervened this summer however and temporarily capped retail rates when monthly power bills nearly tripled the utility a unit of sempra energy is also accumulating a deficit as a result so long as banks and bond markets believe the utilities will be repaid they will be able to borrow analysts say until we hear politicians of consequence state otherwise our position is that we believe the utilities will be made whole says richard cortright a director at standard poors corporate ratings group but that opinion could change if it looks like the utilities will have to swallow a big loss the result lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs and could trigger a downward spiral youre talking about toprated companies though said ms woodland of fitch ibca to get to insolvency a lot would have to happen in the meantime utilities are doing all they can to control the hemorrhaging they have gotten authority from regulators to buy more power under longterm contracts at fixed prices reducing their vulnerability to spotmarket volatility and they have petitioned federal regulators to declare californias market so badly flawed that generators should be denied market pricing and even ordered to pay refunds nevertheless several forces are working against them although they can sign bilateral contracts prices remain high for those as well whats more they cant buy less power than their customers need if they dont buy enough the california independent system operator the organization responsible for reliability will step in and make purchases for them and send them the bill perhaps the biggest problem facing pge and edison though is one of timing the california legislature is out of session until december and regulators havent even really started to address the issue formally in the meantime the utilities deficit is growing by tens of millions of dollars daily write to rebecca smith at rebeccasmithwsjcom,04:50:00,No

2001-10-10,"[""'yardeni@yardeni.com'""]","[""'econews@yardeni.com'""]",New On Dr Ed's Economics Network,wednesday afternoon october one zero two zero zero one new research report from dr ed yardeni stock market cycles bottom fishing httpwwwyardenicompublicmktcyclepdf during bear markets stock investors and investment strategists are constantly on the lookout for the bottom this time is no different indeed many of them thought they caught it at the beginning of april this year they were wrong picking the exact bottom can be very rewarding of course since one nine six zero there have been nine major troughs in the sp five zero zero following declines of one five or more and averaging minus two four after these cyclical lows in stock prices the average one two month gain was an impressive two eight in this special issue of the global strategists handbook i present numerous charts relating key economic and financial indicators to the cycle in stock prices with the focus on finding the ones that are most useful in picking bottoms my conclusion is that many of the ones that have worked best in the past are currently suggesting that the panicselling low of september two one was probably the bottom for this cycle there are no guarantees past performance does not indicate future results as we say in the investment business the low might be retested a lower low might still be in the cards moreover even if it was the bottom the rebound in stock prices over the next one two months may be well below the average in my judgment because stocks are not as undervalued as they were at previous bottoms one of the best times to buy stocks is during crises when panic selling occurs the crises usually trigger corrective policy responses which prove the doomsayers wrong so they present great buying opportunities for bargain hunters of course this is easier said than done for example during the first week that the stock market was open for trading after the attack the right time to buy was on friday not monday by the end of the following week most of the bargains were gone exhibits three one eight in my latest research report show many of the best market timing tools including a few that are not as useful as widely believed pricetoearnings ratios valuation the federal funds rate bond yields the yield curve creditquality yield spreads earnings production commodity prices employment and money most institutional investors cant raise a great deal of cash while waiting for the next crisis to create buying opportunities most tend to be always fully invested so market timing may not be a very relevant exercise for them nevertheless market timing can help boost performance by identifying sectors and industries that tend to either underperform or outperform during a cyclical recovery in stock prices exhibits one nine four eight in this report are designed to provide some insights for the selected industries where relative performance data are

davis power deal by miguel bustillo and nancy vogel times staff writers sacramentodoes it make sense for california to own only part of the states power grid that question is dividing state legislators and energy experts after gov gray davis announcement of a two seven six billion deal to buy southern california edisons transmission lines the deal was reached monday three days after pacific gas electric co balked at selling its power lines to the state and filed for bankruptcy davis and democratic legislators have pushed to purchase the whole transmission system owned by the states debtsaddled private utilities they reason that by owning the highway that electricity must travel to reach homes and businessesa three two zero zero zero mile web of wire that is the worlds fifthlargest coordinated power gridthe state would gain a negotiating advantage with the companies that produce the power if californias transmission grid were entirely owned by the public political leaders believe the state could gain jurisdiction over key electricity issues now decided by the federal energy regulatory commission which has been reluctant to intervene in the energy crisis the state not the commission could then set its own transmission fees and control the flow of electricity across the grid transmission charges bring in roughly one four billion a year for the three utilities with that money the state could not only repay itself for the purchase of the power lines but also fund system upgrades to unclog electricity bottlenecks that contribute to blackouts owning the wires is a business and this business operates at a profit said assemblyman roderick wright dlos angeles who will head a series of committee hearings on the plan to buy the edison lines were not going into their yards and buying old trucks or something we are buying a vital piece of their electrical system however now that pacific gas electric has opted to try to find a solution to its debt problem in bankruptcy court rather than continue negotiations with the state the prospects of california acquiring the entire system appear uncertain at best that is generating concern about what california is getting for its moneyand whether the state stands a chance of gaining any independence from federal regulatorsif it buys only the lines of edison and san diego gas electric the edison deal which needs legislative approval is unlikely to garner a single vote from republicansassembly republican leader dave cox rfair oaks calls the grid purchase a socialistic idea the plan may also encounter some democratic opposition it was a tough sell to begin with and i think if you are going to only buy part it becomes a tougher sell said assemblyman dean florez dshafter and some utility experts say california gains little if anything unless it acquires the whole system the motivating factor for buying the grid as opposed to hydroelectric power plants is because it addressed the central problem facing california the federal government is unwilling to crack down on the generators that are ripping us off and we need to take back control said uc irvine professor peter navarro if you only buy four zero of the system you might as well have nothing california would not be able to make some of the most critical upgrades needed to improve the flow of electricity if it did not acquire pges portion of the system the worst energy bottleneck in california is the notorious path one five a series of highvoltage lines that move power between southern and northern california path one five lies largely in pges territory davis and some state legislators say california still has a chance to buy the entire grid some in fact believe that the utilitys bankruptcy increases the likelihood of a deal talks between davis and pge had faltered in recent weeks and a judge may have better luck bridging their differences negotiations between the state and san diego gas electric continue leaving the possibility of a deal with that utility but acquiring pges portion the largest and most important by far now requires the approval of a federal bankruptcy court judge and in that arena the state may have to compete with private companies for the lines transelect a washington company that wants to create a national network of independently owned transmission lines has offered to buy and operate the grids of edison and pge for a total of five two five billion the company has also been in contact with the davis administration on the possibility of leasing the lines from california if they are bought by the state for the state to buy any of the systems it needs approval from fercfar from a sure thing the commission in recent years has encouraged states to put management of large sections of the nations transmission grid into private hands to achieve more efficient electricity flow even if the commission approved the purchase the state may not receive any increased powers ferc would like to see one large regional transmission system in the west said david clement a transmission expert with cambridge energy research associates if ferc were to unconditionally approve the sale then the transmission system owned by edison would leave ferc authority however ferc could easily condition the sale such that the transmission grid remains under their authority copyright two zero zero one los angeles times,05:49:00,No

international eix saying the current state of californias power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy will call wednesday for an end to californias fouryear experiment with deregulation sources familiar with the issue told dow jones newswires john bryson chief executive of edison international is expected to announce that the companys regulated utility unit southern california edison wont be able to recover more than three billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the states deregulated market structure is scrapped in a move tantamount to a call for reregulation edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within nine zero days and reenter the powergeneration business southern california edison was required to exit under the states landmark one nine nine six deregulation law the sources said edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as two zero the sources said even though regulators rejected edisons request for a rate increase of one zero last week the utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal which would require action by the state legislature the sources said southern california edison with four two million customers is one of the countrys largest electric utilities edison was the first of the states utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and as it says on its web site played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in california among the concessions won by utilities in one nine nine six is the rate freeze which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses edisons current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers about half of those losses are offset the utilitys own power sales revenues which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulationrelated debt rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account edison wouldnt reveal the current size of the surplus but said previously that the california power exchange paid the utility one three billion over its generating costs for power through the end of september at a time when its powerpurchase losses were two four billion powerpurchase losses mounting the net losses continue to mount californias wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks as colder weather arrived in the northwest at a time when much of californias power supply was down for maintenance the price of power for delivery wednesday in california hit an average of one one eight two a megawatthour tuesday up from two five zero a megawatthour a week ago the result of high demand and a decision by californias wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices the rate southern california edison can charge its retail customers however is fixed at six six mwh last week merrill lynch co mer downgraded its ratings for edison international and pge corp pcg the parent of californias other major utility pacific gas electric to neutral saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesnt allow them to raise their retail rates a morgan stanley dean witter mdw analyst drew the same conclusion monday also cutting his rating to neutral edison to this point has kept its powerpurchase losses off its earnings statement in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later the california public utilities commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week however when it ruled against rate increases sought by edison and pge credit rating agency fitch inc on monday lowered its ratings for edison international and southern california edisons senior unsecured debt to the aminus level citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases the agency downgraded edison international the parent because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by southern california edison edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a one billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months california paid more than one billion for power last week sources said some of that however was paid to southern california edison which still generates about two eight zero zero megawatts of power in

commission and the environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this important project this power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing for it does not depend on californias broken deregulated power market said alan j fohrer president and ceo of eme alternatively eme will seek to enter into a longterm costbased contract with either pacific gas

zero zero green will get one more week as the teams starter he will start this sunday vs new orleans but kurt warner is expected to return for the december three rd game at carolina this wont be the last youve heard from green there has been talk that he will take his services elsewhere next year in hopes of obtaining a starting job for now look for green to put up big numbers against the saints defense this week new orleans has a strong pass rush but their corners wont be able to contain the rams receivers long enough for them to pressure green lions dt det fdic updated one one two two zero zero detroit had one of the top pass rushes in the nfl last year but are currently among the worst garnering a mere two two sacks the lions could be primed for a turnaround in the final games of the season detroits pass rush has been much improved since the resignation of head coach bobby ross robert porcher has played especially well in the last two games tallying five sacks and forcing a fumble look for them to have a field day against the patriots sunday new england has allowed an astonishing three eight sacks this season mario bates rb det free agent updated one one two two zero zero an mri on bates knee showed no structural damage and he is expected to play against the patriots thursday bates has been a reliable thirddown back for the lions but hasnt provided much help for fantasy teams this season dont expect that to change when he faces the patriots thursday james stewart rb det the lie downs updated one one two two zero zero stewart was able to practice tuesday and will play in thursdays game against the patriots he suffered a hippointer injury sunday that forced him to miss mondays practice dont be surprised if stewart struggles against the patriots if he isnt full strength he may have a hard time avoiding new englands linebackers marlon barnes rb chi free agent updated one one two two zero zero barnes gained one one yards on three carries against the buccaneers sunday starter james allen will be back in the lineup once again this week after cutting his hand in last sundays game barnes will resume his role as a thirddown back he has played sparingly this season but could have a larger role in the offense next year eddie kennison wr chi murder inc updated one one two two zero zero kennison has been a major disappointment as the bears second receiver this season catching just one touchdown pass through one one games things wont get any better this week when he faces a stingy jets pass defense new york has only given up one one passing tds all season kennison may get a few catches this week but dont expect him to score for your team at this point it would be wise to bench him if you havent already paul edinger k chi free agent updated one one two two zero zero edinger has been on a roll lately making nine of his last ten field goals he could have another big week against the jets this week the bears shouldnt have any problems moving the chains the jets have given up a lot of yards this season but have managed to keep the opposition out of the end zone new yorks defense has also seen opposing offenses attempt an nflleading two eight field goals if edinger can remain accurate in the swirling new jersey winds he will have a big game bears dt chi free agent updated one one two two zero zero look for the bears secondary to contribute a few interceptions for your fantasy team this week as chicago faces the jets and qb vinny testaverde this week testaverde has thrown two or more interceptions in his last five games but if the bears dont put any pressure on testaverde and curtis martin they will rip the defense apart chicago has a weak pass rush and an even softer run defense garrison hearst rb sf free agent updated one one two two zero zero hearst has been added to the four nine ers active roster head coach steve mariucci says he probably wont get into a game this season so it wouldnt be wise to pick hearst up as a free agent he had spent the entire year on the physicallyunabletoperform list after missing all of last season while recovering from a careerthreatening ankle injury keep an eye on hearst though if his condition continues to progress he could be a sleeper pick next year tony horne wr stl free agent updated one one two one zero zero horne one of the leagues best kick returners will be out for four to six weeks after breaking a bone in his right foot during monday nights game against washington he had a two four two yard average on kickoff returns including a one zero three yard touchdown the rams may use azzahir hakim their punt returner on kickoffs but are more likely to sign someone charles kirby rb tb free agent updated one one two one zero zero with mike alstott now out for at least the remainder of the regular season kirby is the only remaining true fullback on the buccaneers roster still he was promoted from the practice squad just two weeks ago merely to serve as a blocker in shortyardage situations so dont expect him to come close to the one two carries per game alstott was averaging warrick dunn will be the primary focus of the running game marshall faulk rb stl fdic updated one one two one zero zero faulk made an impressive return from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee last night against washington making nine catches for eight eight yards and a touchdown while rushing for three three yards on nine carries he had the surgery just one four days prior so the rams were light on his rushing load but faulk looked solid in his first game back expect him to be close to full strength when the rams play new orleans on sunday will blackwell wr pit free agent updated one one two one zero zero the steelers have activated blackwell from the physically unable to perform list and placed him on their five three man roster he was placed on that list july one six after suffering a may knee injury and is an unrestricted free agent after the season still dont count on much if any fantasy value from blackwell mario bates rb det free agent updated one one two one zero zero the lions are awaiting results of an mri performed on bates injured knee which he sustained during sundays game against the giants he is less likely to play thursday against new england than firststringer james stewart james stewart rb det the lie downs updated one one two one zero zero stewart was unable to practice with the team yesterday after suffering a hip pointer in sundays game against the giants with the lions next game coming thursday against new england there isnt much time for him to heal coach gary moeller thinks stewart will be able to play through the injury his status is more critical with backup mario bates also ailing if neither can go fullback cory schlesinger running back sedrick irvin and special teams member brock olivo would fill in scott mitchell qb cin free agent updated one one two one zero zero despite a sprained left knee that required a brace and had him limping yesterday mitchell is still hopeful he can play sunday against pittsburgh he is listed on the injury report as doubtful after suffering a sprained mcl during last sundays game against new england but an mri performed yesterday revealed no damage if mitchell can play he will get the start hell very likely play if its physically possible james allen rb chi fdic updated one one two one zero zero the chicago suntimes reports that allen will not miss practice this week after suffering a cut on his right hand during sundays game against tampa bay he should be ready to play next sunday against the jets cade mcnown qb chi free agent updated one one two one zero zero with shane matthews performing well as the starter the bears can afford to be patient with mcnown as he recovers from a separated left shoulder he threw one five yard passes with matthews before sundays game against tampa bay and will participate in some drills tomorrow mcnown could serve as the third quarterback next sunday against the jets chris chandler qb atl murder inc updated one one two one zero zero chandler might lose some playing time over the seasons final weeks as the falcons try to evaluate rookie doug johnson for their future this isnt a condemnation of the veteran chandler but his owners should make sure hes going to start each week before giving him the nod doug johnson qb atl free agent updated one one two one zero zero the falcons might consider giving johnson some playing time over the seasons final weeks as the team decides whether he can serve as the qb of the future or if one will need to be taken in next years draft if he is given a shot those in keeper leagues should keep a close eye on his performance obafemi ayanbadejo rb bal thrill kill cult updated one one two one zero zero ayanbadejo will likely be inactive for sundays game against cleveland with baltimores bye week coming up after that he will get an extra week to rest and should be ready to roll against san diego in week one five donovan mcnabb qb phi meximullets updated one one two one zero zero the eagles signal caller is really maturing right before our eyes he completed two five ofthree four passes for two one seven yards and accounted for two touchdowns in sundays win over arizona he will need to keep his composure next week against the redskins as the two teams battle for first place in the nfc east the eagles will need a huge performance from mcnabb if they are to beat washington so give him a start this week in the big game albert connell wr was fdic updated one one two one zero zero connell caught five passes for nine six yards in monday nights win over the rams washington will face a tough eagles secondary next week which will be looking to keep their team in first place in the nfc east if the skins can establish their running game early connell could have a big game jeff george qb was the snake pit updated one one two one zero zero george was very impressive in monday nights big win over st louis he completed two four ofthree four passes for two six nine yards and three touchdowns against the rams further clouding the quarterback situation in washington starter brad johnson should know by thursday if he is able to play next week against the eagles so keep tabs on his progress in the coming days if you have either of these players on your roster stephen davis rb was meximullets updated one one two one zero zero davis accounted for one zero six yards of total offense but didnt score a touchdown as washington defeated st louis three three two zero on monday night it was the first time in seven weeks that davis had been held out of the end zone look for the skins to establish davis early in the game next week against the eagles in an effort to open up their passing game jon kitna qb sea ramiro updated one one two one zero zero head coach mike holmgren has named brock huard the starter for this weeks game against the broncos relegating kitna to the seattle bench kitna was named the afcs player of the week two weeks ago but it obviously wasnt enough to keep the starting job elvis grbac qb kc ramiro updated one one two one zero zero grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the bills but the injury wont likely keep him from playing this week against the chargers well see wednesday or thursday said head coach gunther cunningham but from what the doctors told me i think the opportunitys there for him to play broncos dt den the rounders updated one one two one zero zero cornerback ray crockett will miss at least four games with a torn hamstring the injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while crockett was chasing down chargers wideout jeff graham nineyear veteran jimmy spencer will take over crocketts position until he returns akili smith qb cin free agent updated one one two one zero zero smith looks likely to get the start when the bengals play pittsburgh next sunday scott mitchell who started sundays game against new england is listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game just because smith is starting doesnt mean you should do the same he needs to get in gear before hell have any fantasy value terrell davis rb den thrill kill cult updated one one two one zero zero davis will undergo another mri this week on his injured leg and is having an expert in san francisco crosscheck the results at this point the broncos are preparing for this weeks game against seattle as if davis were unavailable if you have davis backup mike anderson it seems like a good idea to include him in your starting lineup this week more updates rostersteams image image meximullets eric bass player tm pos status next bye mcnabb

january three one one two three one am eastern time press release pge issues statement following release of cpuc report san franciscobusiness wirejan three zero two zero zero one pacific gas and electric company today issued the following statement in response to the report released by the california public utilities commission cpuc it is premature to comment in detail about the cpuc report issued late today we plan to study and evaluate this report thoroughly as the cpuc is well aware pacific gas and electric company procured power for its customers in accordance with all cpuc requirements despite having to make purchases at rates substantially higher than those that it could charge to customers as the cpuc report confirms these purchases have resulted in uncollected amounts of six seven billion as of december three one two zero zero zero the transfer of approximately four billion from pacific gas and electric company to pge corporation was consistent with cpuc directives pge shareholders invested their money to build the utilitys power plants and under california law when those plants were sold under deregulation shareholders were entitled to recover their investments cpuc rules require sharp lines between the corporations utility and nonutility businesses and establish a rigorous framework to ensure that those lines are observed ratepayers are not to subsidize the growth of pges national business and they have not the report suggests that the use of affiliate earnings and greater cash conservation efforts could have made a difference that is simply not the case even if the one one seven million of neg earnings that the report attributes to california were used to purchase power and the utility implemented draconian cash conservation measures including laying off every management employee reducing the rankandfile workforce by an additional onethousand employees breaking contracts and implementing a salary freeze on union employees the total savings would amount to less than one months worth of power at current prices the important objective of all parties the utilities lawmakers and regulators including the cpuc should be to move expeditiously to achieve a constructive solution to the energy crisis which is threatening the safety of californians and the economic wellbeing of the state for more information about pacific

there was a concern about the financial stability of one of the reload facilities we currently use in the chicago area premier reload inc i met with romney ruder lumber trader roy lipsett logistics and mike moscoso lumber business controller this morning to gather information and develop a plan this is summarized below general information premier is a facility we have been using for a few months located in franklin park within chicago we deliver to the facility via railcar and ship out via truck we currently have about three eight million board feet valued at about one million in the facility during the holidays we began experiencing problems with our railcars not being unloaded timely we have been pressing for information and are hearing rumors that have raised significant concerns although enron has not received written notification we learned today that premier notified customers that they would not be taking in any more products additionally we have heard that the owner jeff leske is closing the facility and will be going to work for another reload facility in chicago reserve marine terminal rmt we have been in negotiations with rmt for a long term arrangement and much of the information we have obtained is through our contact there in fact we have diverted recent shipments to rmt there is a rumor that premier and or leske may declare bankruptcy there is a rumor that premier has been incurring switching fees with the railroad ihb and has not been paying them there is a rumor that premier has not been paying employment taxes and there are problems with the irs all in all there are many rumors but very few known facts plan met with legal today to get advice they recommended moving the product asap but until moved we needed to confirm the product was marked as enron product and that it is stored separately from other product they are drafting a contract to specify the arrangement with premier it will be ready tomorrow met with credit they are not a included in the reload selection process so the financial stability of the company has not been reviewed a db was pulled today and it confirms a lien filed by the irs on six two two zero zero for eight six one

the associated timeline substantiate the inventory and get the contract signed that legal is drafting on friday morning roy lipsett will join them to meet with rmt discuss movement of the product and complete the negotiations depending on the information gathered tomorrow we will determine next steps if we start moving the product to rmt the estimated timeline is about one three to one four days moving one zero trucks per day total truckloads one three five estimated cost for the movement is about is two five zero zero zero another two five zero zero zero would be incurred for unload fees at rmt if we cant get them to wave them about half of the product has already been sold and will be delivered over the next five weeks romney is working with customers to determine if they can take the

inc washington dow jones california officials have shown bald disregard for federal energy regulatory commission authority and are pursuing shortsighted policies that will push the states two largest utilities over the brink and into bankruptcy ferc chairman james hoecker said thursday the remarks by hoecker who resigned as chairman effective thursday came in a highly unusual formal opinion in what represents his blistering last words on the rapidly unraveling power crisis in california hoecker lambasted gov gray davis and state policymakers for allowing the states power crisis to finally succumb to rolling blackouts state officials ignored the commissions dec one five marketrestructuring order and instead embraced conspiracy theories resistance to more realistic rates and calls for palliative price capsto obscure the issues and delay solutions hoecker said white housebrokered negotiations to develop powersupply contracts as part of a nearterm solution are at an impasse due to unrealistic demands by gov davis that power providers agree to contracts at rates below their cost of production hoecker said he further called for davis and lawmakers to relent in their unrealistic position that retail rates continue to be frozen at belowpresentcost preone nine nine six levels unless state officials agree to pursue realistic policies edison internationals southern california edison co eix and pge corps pacific gas electric co pcg will be pushed into bankruptcy by following the states flawed marketrestructuring law hoecker said perhaps bankruptcy can be averted if it cannot perhaps it will force debtors creditors and state officials to address the financial problems of utilities in a new light without recrimination and posturing he said lets be realistic hoecker said wall street and consumers share one critical trait without a reasonable technically defensible and comprehensive set of solutions to such crises they have no basis for confidence that problems can or will be managed or confidence to support investment on one hand and political forbearance on the other hoecker called for state officials to expeditiously implement the provisions of fercs dec one five order in particular he said the california power exchange is making the financial situation worse by ignoring the orders provision calling for suspension of the singleprice auction when prices bid exceed one five zero per megawatthour prices above the level allowed in the dec one five order have further jeopardized the financial status of california utilities he said reaching a deal on forward contracts as called for in fercs order is essential hoecker said an arbitrary bottomline solution cannot be prescribed without regard to costs he said but hoecker reserved perhaps his harshest criticism for the states first legislative response to the crisis which davis signed into law thursday to replace the california independent system operators industryparticipant governing board with a board of political state appointees such mixing of markets and politics on the iso a fercjurisdictional entity represents an unacceptable intrusioninto federally regulated power markets hoecker said further he said ferc made mistakes in allowing ab one eight nine zero the states electricity restructuring law to usurp the commissions regulatory authority over wholesale power markets in the first place because the state is now clearly a market participant the independence of the iso board is bound to be compromised consequently the states decisions are no longer entitled to the kind of deference we have accorded it since ab one eight nine zero hoecker said more than that this action evinces a bald disregard for federal jurisdiction and a rejection of cooperative solutions called for in fercs dec one five restructuring order hoecker said i recommend that the commission seek to enjoin this technically flawed and unlawful usurpation of its authority hoecker rejected the states continuing call for firm price caps in the region price caps will only jeopardize reliability mask problems temporarily and deter or destroy any chance to solve the longterm supply challenge he said hoecker urged an urgent response by policymakers regardless of whether the utilities enter bankruptcy we cannotkeep moving from one failure to the next with no agreedupon objectives the governors stated plans are unrealistic and ours cannot be fully implemented without his help hoecker concluded i urge state policymakers to reject the false illusion that going it alone will serve the interests

international owners have commercial representation in the states route tnine has the volatility to swing from ws one five five to ws three one five over a months ti me contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any mar ket when broken down for example supplydemand scenarios assume there are two five stems in a month and only two three boats that can make the different dates and if only one zero of those boats are acceptable by the majors or anyone else that is worried about spill liabil ity sanctions combined with a herd mentality that trades on a last done

five one three zero zero zero bbls this size vessel dominates the short haul crude market caribs to usg whe re the refineries are because they are the biggest boats you can get into most of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft loa etc this not only enables the majors to get their crude right in but allow s the traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider rang e of buyers when the big boats vlccs very large crude carriers usua lly two million bbl plus boats come to the usg from the persian gulf west a frica north sea etc they park off at anchorage and then are lightered o r off loaded to seven zero zero zero zero mt boats to then bring the crude in i apologize i f this is remedial for any readers in any event when the usg sees a surg e in big ships coming west to the states the seven zero zero zero zero mt boats get sucked up by the lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to get tight which means rates will swing hard currently it is a weak market at the seven zero x ws one six zero level on average there are approximately three zero physical cargos pmonth for the carib s or the tnine route for the most part the breakdown is as follows mexico cayo arcas pajaritos mayan isthmus olmeca crude mainly domin ated by shell who have the processing deal with the mexicans where they del iver them cpp from the usg citgo has a few as does valero who will proba bly have more with recent acquisition of diamond shamrock refining orion coastal fina conoco koch chevron etc two zero venezuela puerto la cruz amuay puerto miranda la salina bajo grande e tc players are pdv lyondell bp exxonmob conoco orion coastal etc columbia same players we certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns why would this work here in the states with the recent surge in volatility a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their asss handed to them freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading s ome of the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such as contact of affreightments coas for example lyondell has a co a with three different owners to provide two ships per month that totals six move s pmo for two years the freight rates are settled off a one to five point for mula off mardata lloyds register which they in turn can hedge with online two zero owners who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish if h ave an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash flo ws quite possibly origination or marketing could assist in promoting it t o the market unfortunately for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping in another company would hurt me with their freight people who i have to d eal with on physical vessel trading in addition the freight people are n ot going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line t hat trading department heads might have in house freight books as is the case with scott and myself experienced mu ch more activity in two zero zero zero then what we have seen thus far in two zero zero one a combine d result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rat es which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well a s limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any s upply contracts here in houston as when we had two jet stems two gas oil stems and two mogas stems pmonth with the vens in addition we had more spot biz with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in west coast sa merica im confident if the eol tanker freight took off we would once aga in be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far i n ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets the us broker mjlf particularly bob flynn has been trying to get this o ff the ground now for over five years and even had an unsuccessful jv with cit ibank reason being citibank wasnt calling the market but was interested in it from a commission standpoint as was the case with mjlf but setting up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership fiynn presen tly has a seller for two voyages pmonth starting in july the pricing would be the first five days and last five days of each month at ws one nine zero he has a bid of one six zero so theres a lot of middle ground to get this done this is alwa ys the case and is why in the states there have only been about two deals con cluded overall flynn whose motivation is commissions can be viewed as either a competito r of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment for it would b e in his best interest for there to be high activity and as he is the only one presently in the states to have a seller or bid i feel he would be eas y to manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel if this was to take off to the level that enron has taken other markets whereby futu res rates are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are be ing done off of different pricing scenarios ie months average specific day closes first halftwo nd half etc if it became so big that sellers w erent just owners and bids werent just charterers but more of a global bo ok balancing tool who knows what can be done the last time we tried to g et this going was last year when we had an analyst named sameer in the grou p who was coordinating the launch with louise kitchen i believe it lost mo mentum with legal since london has been able to get it going under the di rection of scott moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here scott advises me that he has the supportinfrastructure that enables him to still cover the physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as well as the global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we both follow now i would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to pursue this and get it on the website i am by no means trying to pass the buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the fre ight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a explai ning worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with scott in london,12:56:00,No

largest gas reserves outside of the middle east he said the country would like to tap those reserves for exports as well as for use internally to do so venezuela needs to develop gas infrastructure as

business and eons takeover bid for powergen plc pwg earlier this year and last weeks asset swap with british petroleum bp that will give it close to three zero of ruhrgas ag gruh theyve also defended their home markets and their key power businesses are improving as demonstrated by rising electricity prices but its taken the market time to take note investors were worried by tumbling electricity

eon in expanding into the water business a business offering higher margins thats set to be a key industry of the two one st century he added it has also proven it can cut the fat out of operations

eurone five five billion per year through two zero zero four though it released earnings data promptly after the end of its fiscal year some were disappointed that except for sales rwe failed to release operating and net profit figures beyond giving percentages to the general market though it provided more detailed information to analysts at subsequent meetings we think rwe shows greater

of germanys main gas importer and distributor ruhrgas ag gruh by swapping veba oel for bps two five five ruhrgas stake could have major strategic implications for eon as a player in european gas they added full control of ruhrgas would make eon the number two player in gas in europe and the number one by far in germany said matthias heck at sal oppenheim in the short term there will be no benefit

gtkp could be willing to sell their holdings once that occurs shell and exxon mobil xom are also likely to want to get out as holding a minority positions in eon will be of little interest an analyst in frankfurt said however he added germanys federal cartel office would want the gas market to be deregulated more rigorously before it allows that to happen besides the regulatory opposition there are signs that other market entrants such as enron corp ene will make lower gas prices possible a londonbased analyst said it will also be interesting to see how closely rwe and basf ag bf gas unit wingas gmbh cooperate in acquiring eastern european gas companies slated for privatization that could be the start of something greater said the madrid utility analyst noncore holdings could be problem looking past their core assets he also said the market still worries about their diversification into noncore operations a factor weighing on share prices until the market gets a better idea of what theyre really worth both groups still have vast corporate holdings to dispose of once germanys scrapping of windfall taxes on asset sales comes into effect in january for eon the larger of the

sanctions it imposed in one nine nine eight but took a swipe at the countrys far from optimal investment climate assistant secretary of state on south asian affairs christina rocca blended goodwill with criticism in her speech to business leaders in new delhi on the future of a bilateral relationship which has blossomed despite indias nuclear tests of one nine nine eight she took india to task for protectionist trade policies its investment climate and its failure to provide an effective system for the protection of intellectual property but she had good news on the sanctions which washington imposed on new delhi after its nuclear tests saying india had a role and a responsibility to play in helping secure stable peaceful conditions in south asia and beyond in this connection as i hardly need to tell you a review on our sanctions policy is now under way and we will need to work closely with congress to see how the current situation might be changed getting beyond sanctions would do much to deepen the bilateral relationship a chorus of officials in the bush administration have said in recent weeks that sanctions should be dropped at least in the case of india if not pakistan which was also hit by sanctions after it responded to india with nuclear tests of its own at her confirmation hearing in may rocca told the senate that sanctions had in her opinion outlived their usefulness the sanctions prevent the sale to india and pakistan of us nuclear energy equipment rocket motor technology supercomputers and military equipment they also restrict certain companies from doing business in the united states candid assessment rocca said the bush administration was committed to strengthening and intensifying relations with india and noted that the past few years had seen the beginning of a transformation in ties with the worlds largest democracy now is the time to complete that transformation she said rocca said nonproliferation remained an important goal of us policy but washington wanted to broaden its engagement with india on defence to include potential areas of cooperation the clinton administration held several rounds of talks with new delhi to reconcile its proliferation concerns with indias plans to build a minimum nuclear deterrent but the two sides once on opposite sides of the cold war have moved closer since then and president george w bush won warm backing from new delhi for his controversial nuclear vision rocca said the recent summit between india and pakistan which ended without even a joint statement because of differences over the kashmir territorial dispute was a good first step the serious and constructive atmosphere of these talks tell me that both sides are committed to resolving their differences even if this turns out to be a lengthy process turning to indias decadeold drive for economic reform rocca had some polite criticism during the past one zero years india has achieved considerable progress in liberalising its trade policy she said but in our candid assessment the level of protectionism remains too high this suits some vested interests i suppose but clearly impedes overall economic efficiency she said the problems clouding indias entire investment climate could be summed up with a fiveletter word enron us energy giant enron corp has threatened to walk out of its two nine billion indian dhabol project due to a row with the authirities over payment defaults and high tariffs i have to emphasise that it will be difficult for international investors to view india favourably until it is resolved

two one one on the new york stock exchange yesterday to close at four two six five the spinoff announcement comes on the heels of a similar plan announced in october by a baltimore competitor constellation energy group inc but instead of separating in one step like constellation allegheny energy hopes to first raise money by selling up to one eight percent of the common stock in the new

leveraged lease of one of its power stations to finance the growth and development of its generation portfolio officials said noia said the two companies will have different dividend policies and more details will be established at the time of the stock offering noia also said that the merchant energy company is expected to grow about two zero percent a year while the delivery company will grow about four percent to five percent it is unclear whether alleghenys spinoff will have to pass reviews by five state regulatory agencies gregory v carmean executive director of the maryland public service commission said you can expect us to follow the same path of examining their regulated utilitys financial strength after the split as we have done with constellations separation plan yesterday utility analysts praised the company for its timing despite the public relations and regulatory pounding some energy producers have received recently as a result of the california energy crisis energy stocks have also suffered recently because of greater supply and lower demand because of cooler weather the unregulated power producers have done quite well in recent years with the exception of this year because of california said craig shere a standard poors analyst these stocks have been so beaten up over the issue of price caps and rebates but theres very little substance behind it all its not the greatest market right now so if allegheny had to do an ipo right now id wait but the market for this sector should not be bad for the fourth quarter at the end of the day these companies will continue to post very strong earnings alleghenys done quite well because everyones been expecting this to happen this is and will continue to be a growth industry shere said in the past couple of years allegheny has carefully completed each step toward making a spinoff possible allegheny began preparing for deregulation by transferring power plants from its regulated utility allegheny power to the unregulated generating business in one nine nine six starting with its plants in pennsylvania allegheny power still owns power plants in west virginia which has only partially deregulated the electric industry but noia said those remaining two zero zero zero megawatts will be transferred to allegheny energy supply before the separation takes place in order to meet the electricity needs of customers in each state noia said the regulated utility has a number of longterm contracts with its unregulated supply affiliate to buy back power the last of which ends in two zero zero eight as part of the plan to split allegheny also launched an aggressive one billion plan to purchase and build power plants across the country allegheny energy supply is building power plants in arizona indiana

sacramento bee published july two four two zero zero one the wrestling match between politicians and enron corp moved into a more intense arena over the weekend when a state senate investigating committee sought contempt penalties because the huge energy company has refused to turn over internal documents although houstonbased enron owns no major power plants in california it has adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high and it has become in turn a whipping boy for california politicians at one point last spring state attorney general bill lockyer said he wanted criminal charges against enron and its chairman kenneth lay i would love to personally escort lay to an eight byone zero cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says hi my name is spike honey lockyer said with less colorful language gov gray davis has often castigated texasbased companies as price gougers even though texas firms have been fairly minor suppliers to california some of it is just buzzword politics lockyer and davis know that californians dislike anything associated with texas and lay has been one of president bushs major political supporters enron meanwhile cites the rhetoric as evidence that lockyer davis and legislative investigators are interested less in finding the truth than in seeking scapegoats enron also filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the senates subpoenas of trading data most other energy companies have complied with the demands creating sacramento repositories of the data under elaborate confidentiality agreements worked out with the special senate committee headed by sen joseph dunn dsanta ana but enron has refused and on saturday dunn submitted a report asking the senate for an appropriate coercive sanction does enron have something to hide or does it sincerely believe that whats happening in california is political scapegoating are the companies fears about the confidentiality of the data sought by the senate justified would data be selectively leaked to show the firms in the worst light would data be used by competitors or could the information find its way into the hands of classaction attorneys dunn a prominent trial attorney himself insists that confidentiality will be protected and that the information being sought is only for legislative purposes but enron and the other companies have some reason to be wary of turning over confidential information to politicians similar information was leaked without penalty in last years investigation of former state insurance commissioner chuck quackenbush and there are indications that private lawyers are working closely with investigators mike aguirre the san diego attorney seeking a smoking gun to prove collusion among energy companies supplied dunns committee with a few dissident duke energy workers who alleged in highly publicized hearings that the firm had manipulated production at its san diego plant to create artificial shortages and drive up spot market power prices duke then refuted the charges by releasing some excerpts from the records of the independent system operator the controller of californias power grid indicating that iso had ordered the plant operational changes aguirre subsequently asked the governors office to pressure the iso now under davis direct control to release all of the dukerelated documents that would show he says that the firm actually manipulated the situation duke and other companies insist that the isoheld documents are proprietary aguirre pleaded with one davis adviser in an email that we need your help in properly getting this information out but aguirre in an interview said he had not yet obtained cooperation from davis aides the political and legal struggle to affix blame for californias energy woes will continue for months perhaps years the crisis will cost ratepayers at least five zero billion and theyll want to know why as they make out their utility bill checks,10:29:00,No

quickhouectect barbara gray teresa g bushmanhouectect subject re summary of tom brown meeting confidential work product attorney client privilege dan our letter was definitely structured to encourage a quick solution as the situation stands now wildhorses possible responses to the letter are as follows one declare unprofitability wrt to the gas covered by the amendment if they do so then they have the obligation to provide alternatives to crescendo one of which is release of the gas you are right there is no time frame in the contract under which they must resolve these alternatives that is a risk i pointed out early however in our letter to wildhorse i proposed a time frame to resolve these issue of two weeks if wildhorse is not working with us in good faith within a commercially reasonable time then we will have to make a choice a go for a declaratory judgment to have the gas released from the contract this will take time depending on court docket loads six months to one year b inform wildhorse that we have been unable to reach an agreement within a commercially reasonable time and they have not negotiated in good faith and we consider the gas released contract breached by wildhorse and that we will build our own system then crescendo would build its own system and risk a suit by wildhorse two not declare unprofitability if wildhorse does not declare unprofitability then they have the obligation under the contract to take the gas in accordance with its terms the only complication is that under the contract wildhorses obligation to take the gas is subject to the downstream carriers ability to receive the aggregate gas stream depending on wildhorses flow dynamics and our plant placement wildhorse could use this as reason to refuse delivery of our gas after your field meeting and our engineering assessment hopefully we will have a better understanding of that situation if wildhorse does not declare unprofitability we would demand evidence and assurances that they will be able to take the gas upon start up of the treating plant if wildhorse does not declare unprofitability but continues to discuss renegotiating of this deal i would very directly ask them under what provision of the contract do they believe they have the right to renegotiate any fees they dont have a right to renegotiate under the contract without unprofitability dan j bumpenron zero eight zero one two zero zero zero zero five two three pm to gerald nemechouectect cc scott joseycorpenronenron brian redmondhouectect joan quickhouectect subject summary of tom brown meeting i wanted to provide a summary of my meeting with tom brown today i met with the business development director bob mustard one tom brown as four five owner of wildhorse is pushing kinder morgan to come up with solutions to the production problems quality pressure et al currently being experienced in the piceance basin two tom brown is also encouraging kmi to develop plans to take crescendo and other producers low btu gas they see these as a new business opportunity for wildhorse three tom brown is focusing their drilling efforts in other regions of the rockies therefore tbi would be interested in discussing entrada development ventures with crescendo bob worked at amoco with ken krisa and is very familiar with the nitrogen treating technology i passed all this info on to kenjim four heres the interesting partbob discussed confidentially that for the past six eight monthstom brown has been trying to negotiate a buyout of kinder morgans interest in wildhorse they have a righttomatch provision in their llc agreement the snag is on the last increment of valuation which is now being negotiated by the very top mgmt kinder evans if they are successful which he thinks tbi will be then tbi will turnaround and look to spin off the nonstrategic systems like the piceance basin assets to third party purchasers this conversation with tom brown led me to a worst case scenario with regard to our negotiations with wildhorsewildhorse has been slowplaying negotiations since i first met with them in late may and four above may be the reason why now that weve sent the letter recently to wildhorse requesting essentially to clarify their understanding status of the contracts so we can get to work my feeling based on the transaction between kmi tbi is that wildhorse may try to continue stalling until their transaction with tbi is complete how much longer will this take of course if the transaction is completed tbi has already made it clear they would like to sell this system so even if ena is interested will tbi negotiate a gathering deal during this transition period or delay until the system is divested the point is thisim anticipating a generic noncommital response to crescendos letter from wildhorse although i realize there are no time deadlines in the contract could you suggest anything we can submit in writing to encourage a quick resolution to our contractual issues in the event my above worst case scenario begins to play itself out im off to grand junction to meet with wildhorse ill keep you informed of any developments thanks dan,07:20:00,"Yes

clarifying our position regarding the monthly direct assignment charges under article one two of the ia please let me know your take best regards teresa brown seven one three six two seven six five nine two weve taken a look at the answer arizona public service company filed on one two two two zero zero in response to our protest there are a number of issues to which dena should consider responding responses must be filed by monday january eight two zero zero one study assumptions aps answer at eight nine aps argues that there is no benefit from disclosing assumptions and that this would give a generator an unfair market advantage over other market participants while aps does not indicate to whom there is no benefit presumably it means aps we should consider challenging this since there is a benefit to disclosure of the study assumptions how else is a generator to determine whether it is being asked to goldplate aps system aps answer to this is to say that the ias willful action provisions prevent aps from conducting activities or making decisions based on motive to serve financial benefit we are at a loss however as to how the provisions accomplish that since what they really do is shield aps from liabilityi agree and agree that aps response doesnt make sense i believe that the commission has required entergy to provide more study data to a generator in one of last years complaints against entergy either dynegy or nrg what about a response on the must run issue p two seven two eight i think aps is trying to back door the arizona proposed requirements that are still being fought and are not accepted this is a big issue and aps response does not address our arguments other than stating that must run should be required in the ia i do not know of any other interconnection agreements that have mustrun provisions transmission credits aps answer at three zero three one aps claims that transmission credits are appropriate only for firm service a proposition the commission just rejected in the comed order issued on one two eight zero zero absolutely agree that it should be for firm and nonfirm monthly direct assignment charges aps answer at three two three three we should consider clarifying our position on this issue which aps appears to misunderstand aps argues that in our protest we addressed the cost of modifications not the cost of operation and maintenance and thus were comparing apples to oranges this is not true rather what we argued is that we should not be responsible for the cost of operating and maintaining any facilities for which we were not responsible for the initial installation cost aps apparently missed the pointi agree willful action aps answer at three three three seven aps essentially argues that the strict liability provisions in the ia are appropriate because it cannot make a profit by entering into an ia unlike with respect to transmission service it recovers only its actual costs aps ignores the fact that by interconnecting a generator aps will ultimately generate transmission revenue aps also ignores the benefits that new generation bring to the table aps has not justified why the liability provisions are consistent with or superior to the pro forma tariff and why a generator should be required to bear the consequences of aps negligence and in many instances intentional misconduct particularly where aps is not provided any incentive to act prudently simply because aps receives no profiti agree aps proposed restrictions are wholly unwarranted and are outrageous there are no other interconnection agreements that i know of containing anything remotely similar please let us know how youd like to proceed if you have any questions let us know thanks gretchen,00:59:00,No

before the state opens its power market next week the costs are aimed at offsetting expenses for building generating plants and related regulatory financing plans prior to deregulation as natural gas prices soared a year ago the puc alleged that txu and other texas utilities had no stranded costs related to generating assets because of the large amount of natural gas fired generation in the state climbing prices made natural gas fired plants almost as costly to operate as nuclear plants if the settlement is approved by the puc txu will return three five zero million to retail electric suppliers over two years by providing credits on transmission and distribution rates txu said it may take a charge of less than five zero million in the four th quarter because of the settlement txu also said it would eliminate any remaining stranded costs related to its comanche peak nuclear station txu also proposes that the puc authorize it to issue five zero zero million in bonds in early two

organization in the midwest is an important decision it will spark the development of a competitive regional power market in the midwest of particular importance to energyintensive midwestern states according to a customer coalition active in the federal arena the coalition of midwest transmission customers and the industrial energy usersohio stated that fercs decision paves the way for actual implementation of plans to get a truly independent entity for the midwest transmission grid that encompasses twenty states and manitoba canada up and running the coordination so critical to system reliability and ohios business and industry can now proceed on a timeline that should allow the midwest to avoid a repetition of problems we saw a couple of summers ago because the midwest economy is so energyintensive the coalition hopes to see the iso continue with development at a challenging pace since an effective regional marketplace will benefit not only residential users but also midwestern businesses in their efforts to thrive in the worldwide marketplace the ferc order also found that creation of the alliance rto does not satisfy scope and configuration requirements spelled out in fercs order two zero zero zero the commission made plain that the alliance companies could continue with the formation of the forprofit transco but under the midwest iso umbrella the significance of this is that the ferc is focusing on the importance of a single organization as opposed to its form from the perspective of market participants both buyers and sellers this and other

the company took one zero one billion in charges and writedowns on illfated investments measures enron executives said credit rating agencies were comfortable with ubs warburg analyst ronald barone said on wednesday he was not thrilled by the announcement during a conference call to discuss thirdquarter earnings and for good reason moodys investors service subsequently issued a statement saying it had placed all of enrons longterm debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade there appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved barone said the writedowns on poorly performing assets and a more detailed breakdown of the companys operations went some way to appeasing wall street after a tumultuous year in which enrons stock lost about twothirds of its value but analysts said they were not about to let enron off the hook just yet bear stearns analyst robert winters said he remained concerned about enrons quality of earnings and cash flow winters said he believed enron would have liked to take even bigger charges and writedowns but was unable to do so without putting its credit ratings at risk which could adversely affect some of the companys financing arrangements problem assets and overvalued assets on the balance sheet remain particularly overseas he said one such asset is enrons

seven reuters energy companies said the future development of new power plants and transmission lines in the us northeast hinges in part on setting up a northeast regional transmission organization rto rtos are predominantly forprofit groups established to bring all of a regions highvoltage transmission lines under central control while ensuring equal access to the lines to all power suppliers seeking to market their goods across the grid the federal energy regulatory commission ferc which oversees the interstate wholesale power market believes rtos will benefit consumers by enhancing competition among power providers in turn improving service and driving down rates if ferc can drive the northeast rto to closure in a reasonable period of time it will accelerate the development of new transmission and generation enron corps managing director of global government affairs rick shapiro told reuters houstonbased enron is the nations top energy marketer how and when the rto gets implemented will radically impact the market its crucial to the development of the market in new england mirant corp spokesman ray long told reuters energy provider mirant of atlanta has one four zero zero megawatts mw of generation in new england the company is currently adding another seven zero zero mw to its canal station in massachusetts once we get the permits for canal we will reassess whether to proceed with the project a big part of that assessment will depend on the rto process long said the northeast rto ferc wants to see four superregional rtos created in the us in the northeast midwest southeast and west several regions have taken long strides toward developing rtos including a notforprofit model proposed in the midwest and rival forprofit plans vying for ferc approval in the west ferc chairman patrick wood seeking to spur the development of rtos favors giving utilities until dec one five to join one or forfeit their right to sell electricity in the wholesale market though the commission has not voted on this plan the northeast rto will include new england new york the pennsylvanianew jerseymaryland pjm region and possibly parts of eastern canada ferc said it wants the northeast rto to be built on the pjm market platform and to include the best practices of the new england and new york markets pjm interconnection which operates the power grid in parts of pennsylvania new jersey maryland delaware virginia and washington dc is the nations only fully functioning rto the process ferc set in place to establish one rto in pjm new york and new england is going to get us where we need to be in terms of having a vibrant wholesale market long said long said mirant determined a single northeast rto would save more than four four zero million annually by eliminating the artificial borders that now exist between new york new england and pjm an administrative law judge acting as a mediator for ferc considered three proposals for creating the northeast rto the three plans were proposed by interested parties including mirant and enron and the regions grid operators the new york independent system operator iso in new york iso new england in new england and pjm last month the judge asked the ferc to decide who will govern the northeast rto and what the timetable is to put the plan in place the judge favored a plan put forward by the new york iso and iso new england if ferc implements the rto plan proposed by pjm in two zero zero three consumers could save one five billion four four zero million a year over the new yorknew england plan which would not be implemented until two zero zero six long said under the pjm plan pjm would overlay its current market model across the entire region while adopting some of the best practices

natural gas storage inventory die a company executive said tuesday because the american gas association has said it will discontinue its weekly gas storage report at the end of the year enron would like to see another organization take over the report said john lavorato president and chief executive of the companys americas wholesale services unit speaking at a meeting with analysts lavorato said the storage report is important for the gas industry to keep track of industry fundamentals without a regular report on storage gas inventory the gas industry can expect less frequent but greater price changes than seen in the past he said the department of energys energy information administration publishes monthly data on gas storage but the information isnt as timely as data the aga reports each wednesday the eia issued its latest gas storage report oct nine it showed the amount of gas in storage at the end of july the data comes from reports filed by operators of gas storage facilities it also showed estimates of the amount of gas in storage at the end of august and september those estimates are generated by a computer model wednesdays weekly storage report from the aga will show estimated inventory as of oct one two the aga estimate is based on reports from gas storage facilities that data is then run through an aga computer model to generate the report lavorato said he would like to see the eia the interstate natural gas association of america or consultants like pira energy group an international energy consulting firm take over reports on storage inventory ingaa is an industry trade group representing gas pipeline companies in the us canada and mexico they manage many of the gas storage facilities lavorato would like to see a new report based on data that could be audited he said he said he thinks the aga has found itself in the middle of something it didnt want to be in originally intended for use within the gas industry the weekly aga report has become highprofile and is even watched by equity markets he said some industry participants have criticized the aga report wondering whether it can be manipulated by companies that supply data to the aga

secretary spencer abraham to fill the open seat on the federal energy regulatory commission the white house said if the senate approves kelliher a former republican counsel for the house energy and commerce committee the commission will have its full five members for the first time since pat wood bushs first ferc appointee became chairman sept one i hope they speed him through the process said commissioner nora brownell a republican who was appointed by bush earlier this year he is a thoughtful person who knows how to work through issues kellihers nomination comes as the commission has pledged to closely monitor and investigate abuses in the electricity and natural gas markets and promote competition in the next month or so it is due to choose which groups will run the electric

western power sales washington oct one seven bloomberg federal regulators are considering changes to wholesale price caps on electricity in california and one zero western states which power producers hope will allow them to charge more when supplies in the region are tight the federal energy regulatory commission plans a public conference oct two nine to discuss altering the pricing formula the commission established caps in april and june after skyrocketing electricity costs led to insolvency for californias largest utilities units of pge corp and edison international we have heard and understand that people do think the solution was very californiacentric and it was ferc chairman pat wood said indicating changes in the formula are likely but californias needs were very urgent at the time while commissioners declined to say what they would be willing to change about the pricing formula they want to fine tune the caps before the winter which is the peak period of demand and may yet cause another jump in prices wood said changes could be made next month the current pricing formula is based on the mostexpensive power generated in california enron corp sierra pacific resources and other sellers of power to california want the formula to consider costs from all generators in the region enron blamed the formula for a july two blackout in nevada when sellers withheld supply because local prices were too low based on the highest cost of supply then being offered in california lower power costs though the cost of wholesale power in california has dropped since the commission ordered the first emergency cap on april two five wood said the western states may face another shortage of power and high prices this winter the pacific northwest depends on hydropower for much of its energy needs and rainfall has been below normal this year part of the shortfall in power last year and early this year was the result of a drought that reduced power available from dams i remain concerned about that part of the country wood said it has not been raining a whole lot out there the average price for a megawatthour at the california oregon border in september was two four nine one down from three one three seven zero in april a megawatthour is enough electricity to power about seven five zero average california homes for an hour on the agenda for this months conference is a proposal to link the formula to the price of natural gas a fuel used in many generating plants im not predisposed for or against specific changes said ferc commissioner nora brownell the oct two nine conference will help the commission determine aspects of the price control that the parties involved agree are working and those that are not she said surcharge in a related matter the commission also may halt the one zero percent surcharge it permits generators to charge in california to cover the costs of collecting bad debt the insolvent california utilities now have plans to pay off their debts for power sellers in the west the current price caps often require utilities to sell their excess power at a loss enron sierra pacific and other marketers said in statements to the commission they said the price they sometimes pay for power is higher than the cost of supply from the mostexpensive producer in california the determination of the proxy price should not be limited to california generators enron said in a government filing it should be determined by the leastefficient generator in the entire west power marketers also should be allowed to recover justifiable costs above the proxy prices enron wrote california officials had demanded the price controls after pges pacific gas electric and edisons southern california edison racked up more than one four billion in powerbuying losses the caps were extended to other western states oregon washington arizona nevada wyoming new mexico colorado montana idaho and utah in june because some said generators in the west could simply get around the cap by selling outside california when prices were higher elsewhere the caps dont expire until sept three zero two zero zero two though they can be changed california said before the price cap was extended to other states that it sometimes had to outbid buyers in neighboring states at prices above the caps to buy enough electricity to avoid blackouts on july two sierra pacific cut supplies to one zero zero zero zero customers for four five minutes when temperatures soared and three power plants were idled it couldnt buy five zero megawatts of power in the spot

number two unless one of the parties to a transaction is a us counterparty or there is a local law requirement i am not sure we need representation five b we obtain essentially the same representation from the counterparty under representation five d noted and agreed i would recommend reinserting the paragraph entitled early termination that you have deleted enron prefers to have loss apply for valuations upon early termination especially in situations where there is not a liquid market or for unusual or longdated trades i think the weather market is one where enron would prefer to use the loss method of calculation see four a and b and inform me if this is sufficient i would also reinsert the designation that enron is the calculation agent unless there is a good reason to not designate a calculation agent see four d and inform me if this is sufficient i assume that the payee tax representations are not applicable because there is no withholding for either residents or nonresidents

the organizations that receives much of its funding from the united way i was surprised to find out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused houston children and the caring adults who will open their homes as foster parents i had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to the center learning about the important programs offered through depelchin and meeting four yearold jessica and ten yearold steven who were temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to have made that pledge enron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to nonprofit organizations hopefully many of you take advantage of this to stretch your charitable giving during the year the united way campaign is the one time each year that enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a difference in the lives of so many in houston each dollar pledged by an employee is matched by enron if you have not yet completed your electronic pledge please consider doing so as soon as possible our united way campaign draws to its conclusion next wednesday august two three i hope that each one of you will consider making a pledge there is no gift that is too small because cumulatively all enron employees can make a significant positive impact for houston log on to httpunitedwayenroncom to complete your pledge card thanks to the many of you who have already completed your electronic pledge,11:10:00,No

just stop beating around the bush and just get down to the bottom line h ere i like everyone else out here have some questions and comments for you i want you to get down to our terms and answer these in laymans terms we u nderstand pistons crankshafts and nuts bolts so please keep all of you acronyms out of it where in the world did you get the questions for the mergerqa someone has messed around with our retirement our livelyhood and our famil ies do you really think we give a flip about what enron field is named do you really think we care if the enron body shop stays open do you really think we care about the united way right now no we have been cheated out of money here have you ever put a pencil to i t probably not since your wages total in the mm figure lets just do that lets

out immediately after your merge r email does the board of directors ever read that document we read it many times a year perhaps you should practice what you all preach have you had a stranger walk up to you on the street and ask what have you done to the stock well that is happening out here what have we done to deserve this treatme nt nothing but cut ourselves down to the meanest leanest teams

shapironaenronenron subject re rto advocacy positions to the discussion i would add the following one our efforts to push hard zonal markets has not been overly successful the opponents of such schemes continue to win converts that the interzonal and intrazonal congestion costs will be large and that it is very difficult to get the right zones moreover in markets like ercot the zonal structure has been coopted by the large incumbents to frustrate the development of the market two one solution discussed throughout the east is the hybrid model lmp in the realtime and flowgates to manage forward transmission congestion if structured properly this allows the power desk to have a a realtime energy market and b managable transmission risk there are disagreements between the policy experts about flowgates see point five three our goal is to work within the rto process and build markets that work for enron key goals one single control area for the rto two real time energy market with no penalties for unbalanced positions three market hubs similar to pjm west for liquidty and four manageable transmission congestion using market solutions four i agree with tim that it is very difficult to come up with one perfect market structure proposal for enron both for technical and timing reasons california is in a different place than spp we are trying to coordinate our statements in each of the markets as much as possible most importantly and we have had some troubles in ercot lately we need to make sure that saying something in one market doesnt damage our other advocacy efforts government affairs is trying to make sure that we push at the right time and place and ensure that our messages have the necessary context five we still hear some open questions about the best form of marketbased congestion managment option vs obligation use it or lose it christi nicolay is having a call on friday to discuss these issues please contact her if anyone from your teams should attend call with any other questions at some point we need to ensure complete agreement of our policys and our advocacy efforts on rtos jim kevin m prestoect zero two two zero two zero zero one zero

hainhouectect subject re rto advocacy positions are you putting words in my mouth tim the east is absolutely adamant about having a liquid realtime energy markets with a real supply curve and a real demand curve such that hourly clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity with respect to the number of hourly price signals within an rto that is necessary that is subject to much debate although i prefer a zonal model for simplicity reasons the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in the east in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time energy market we may have settle for a limited lmp in which nodal pricing is necessary for managing the congestion but proxy buses are created in zones three five per rto for purposes of realtime energy markets our views i believe are still very much aligned however i need to make some progress on the creation of real time energy markets the zonal markets implemented in nepool and contemplated for ercot result in a mispriced commodity with no real price signal sent to the market out of merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion is managed through energy uplift payments congestion price signal is not sent to the market this results in a very inefficient commodity market where the consumer gets screwed and market makers cant price the commodity or transportation on a forward basis i hope this clarifies any misunderstanding steve walton was in portland last week and updated me on the latest vision for rtos that was developed by the east desk this vision seems to differ somewhat from what we are advocating in the west in particular it seems like the east has embraced a nodal system while the west is firmly planted in the zonal flowgate camp i have asked steve to flesh out more details of the nodal approach in particular how do the nodes map to a fairly homogeneous zone and how does this impact pure trading positions ie a transaction with no asset being directly scheduled to support it versus assetbased trades where the meter must settle with the rto while the trade settles with the market it may be that the physical characteristics of the east and west warrant different models for example the west has large longdistance high voltage lines that are very amenable to a zonal approach the east has more local transmission bottlenecks that may not be modeled as easily it also could be that the political reality in the east and west require different positions as things sit now there is no way that a zonal approach could fly in the northwest in contrast pjm seems firmly planted in the nodal finally it could be that the east desk and the west desk have a difference of opinion on what the ideal market structure should be if that is the case then perhaps we need to talk some more given the different advocacy positions in the east and the west i dont think that we can come up with a broad nationwide advocacy position at this time that is i dont think that we should endorse either zonal or nodal as the answer at ferc instead i think that we should focus on the objectives that rtos should try to achieve and be flexible as to what the best market structure should be to achieve these objectives what do you guys think about this regards tim,01:43:00,No

nine eight eight reso enrondoc dan first ive attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the city manager to execute the enfolio agreement more importantly i need to inform you that our senior management has reviewed the referenced contract i have been asked to present additional changes to the agreement for enrons consideration and to raise questions about certain of its terms and conditions let me start from page one top to bottom and proceed to the end of the exhibits one there is the word draft above the title of the enfolio agreement which should be deleted two the introductory paragraph line five should not contain the words one st of january two zero zero one it should be left blank until the parties have signed the contract otherwise the city will be in breach as of the date it signs the contract because article two section two one requires the city to proffer the tobeapprovedbycouncil resolution as of one one zero one three article two section two four line two the city customer wants enron company to confirm every recorded telephonic transaction as defined therefore the city requests the word may should be changed to shall four article three sections three one and three two first sentence buyers requested quantity refers to the dcq or maxdq sellers failure to schedule the buyers requested quantity shall constitute a sellers deficiency default how does a maximum daily delivery point quantity fit into a sellers deficiency default if the buyers requested quantity does not include a maximum daily delivery point quantity what is the reason for the omission five article four section four one lines one five and two three line two three refers to reasonable attorneys fees yet line one five refers to attorneys fees to be internally consistent line one five should say reasonable attorneys fees six section four one right hand column lines three four a statement showing the determination of the termination payment will be prepared its unclear whether the city is entitled to review and challenge the determination before a dispute is referred to arbitration the city should be entitled to receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is obligated to pay the termination payment please clarify or permit the city to exercise these rights seven section four two iv specifies that a triggering event will exist if a bankruptcy petition is undismissed within three zero days is this under bankruptcy laws the minimum period of time within which one may seek dismissal of a bankruptcy petition please refer to the one one usc section that backs up this provision or change to six zero days eight section four two v and vi please change three zero days to five days the city is concerned with the number of days that enron may be permitted to fail to schedule before a triggering event is triggered by enron nine section four two ix this language discusses a default by enron corp enas parent but no mention is made of enas default in this regard please explain one zero section four five line four is a company supposed to refer to the company one one article five the city is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision as drafted it states that the parties must perform even if a fm event earthquake would prevent either or both parties from performing with the six zero day period stated therein there is no such limitation under california law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary one two article seven section seven two could enron translate the last sentence we dont understand it one three appendix one act please explain why section three is referred to one four appendix one claims line four please add reasonable before attorneys fees one five appendix one gaap this should read gaap means generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied with respect to company and governmental generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied with respect to customer one six appendix one interest rate please delete two percent over the city has a aaa bond rating therefore the city believes the two over prime should not apply to it one seven appendix one material adverse change what does enron believe the citys net worth to be the four zero zero million threshold is mentioned also what is enas bond rating is bbb an investment grade rating one eight representations and warranties because we have agreed that the opinion of counsel will not be required the reps and warranties are being deleted but the representations and warranties is nevertheless included in the agreement item i should be deleted because the city has not undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue an opinion we would like to delete and vii it is

thereto andor etc two one arbitration disputes to be arbitrated we do not as a matter of legal policy agree to arbitration but we will mediate disputes is enron amenable to mediation this process is less formal and less costly in my opinion two two authority for transactions staff would like the agreement to include a list of employees for company and customer who are authorized to trade on behalf of their employers could a statement be added to this section to this effect then we could attach the lists as an exhibit c thank you so much for considering these issues there are others which

alternate url httpwwwceracomclientcealtzero eight two two zero zero _one eight ce_alt_zero eight two two zero zero _one eight _abhtml as western markets continue to struggle through high august demand and prices for both power and natural gas september looms as the start of the fall shoulder season the shoulder season historically has brought the possibility of a break in weather and a demand drop in both power and gas prices from summer levels cera expects this shoulder season to differ from years past however with power and gas markets producing strong yearoveryear prices and little relief from summer levels even with normal september weather westwide power loads will decline but will remain similar to those in june a month with high power prices in addition compared with june levels hydroelectric capacity has dropped owing to reduced stream flows leaving more expensive gasfired generation to replace declining hydroelectric output cera expects occasional hot weather and higher gas prices to push onpeak prices in the west to two four four percent over september one nine nine nine levels continued strong use of gasfired generation in the west as well as low us storage inventories and tight supply demand balances will keep the pressure on gas prices topock prices are expected to average four four five per million british thermal units mmbtu in september these high september gas and power prices are driven by declining hydroelectric output the months of september through november represent the low point for hydroelectric output in the west with rainfall historically boosting output in december approximately one six four zero zero average megawatts amw will be available from hydroelectric facilities during the threemonth period this represents a net reduction in capacity of six nine zero zero amw when compared with the recent juneaugust summer months and a reduction of three six zero zero amw when compared with september one nine nine nine levels higher more variable power demand the southwest and southern california still experience hot weather in september and regional utilities typically consider it possible that a years peak load event will occur in september spiking loads however can quickly retreat with a return to cooler weather thus power loads and power prices are expected to experience a high degree of variability during september high levels of gasfired generation load growth and a declining hydroelectric resource base will require gasfired resources to serve approximately the same level of demand as in june two zero zero zero a month with similar average demand and monthly average onpeak power prices in the one five zero one seven eight per megawatthour mwh range depending on the region this strong pull on gasfired plants will push deep into the generation resource base driving prices upward an additional one seven billion cubic feet bcf per day will be required for gasfired generators in the us west compared with september one nine nine nine levels strong north american gas prices natural gas prices are expected to retain most of this summers peak levels as north american supplies remain tight a market anxious about winter demand and price levels will also limit a price retreat this fall as a result average september henry hub prices are expected to trade around three nine five per mmbtu an active storm season could keep henry hub prices near the four five zero mark strong western basis differentials the strong demand for gas to serve gasfired generation and storage concurrently will maintain western basis differentials at high levels especially in the california markets cera expects a topocktohenry hub differential of zero four zero per mmbtu during september extended operational problems associated with el pasos pipeline rupture would raise that outlook regional power market drivers hotterthannormal august weather transmission and generator outages high natural gas prices and declining hydroelectric output all contributed to a rise in power price levels during august southern california average power prices in august have thus far exceeded july levels by an average of nine zero per mwh during the onpeak period and by one four per mwh during the offpeak period midcolumbia power prices bearing the brunt of fireinduced transmission outages experienced a jump from july price levels of one one four per mwh for the onpeak period and two zero per mwh in the offpeak period offpeak prices which have averaged above six zero per mwh during the juneaugust period are clearly defined by the production cost of gasfired resources onpeak prices during this same period at over one zero zero per mwh in all regions in all months have reflected a significant premium at times over the cost of the marginal system generator see table one a return to normal weather should drive westwide loads down by eight three zero zero amw in september from august levels however load growth and a return to normal weather are expected to push loads up by five four zero zero amw when compared with september one nine nine nine levels these greater loads coupled with a reduction in hydroelectric generation of three six zero zero amw from last septembers levels will create supply tightness during september see tables two and three hydroelectric coal and nuclear generation together will be insufficient to serve westwide demand in september even during much of the offpeak periods requiring gasfired resources to meet a significant portion of the load gas demand for power generation is expected to average five two bcf per day in september down from over five nine bcf per day in august but up by a dramatic one seven bcf per day compared with levels in september one nine nine nine september power prices will be defined by a floor set by the incremental cost of gasfired generation approximately five zero per mwh with prices frequently higher as demand increases as this summer has clearly demonstrated prices rise in a nonlinear fashion as supplies grow very tight hot weatherinduced loads should provide additional examples of this relationship cooler or hotterthannormal weather in september coupled with the inherent high variability of september loads will produce a wide range of price outcomes under normal weather onpeak power prices are expected to fall in the one one three one two three per mwh range depending on location representing a two four four percent premium to yearago september prices see figure one the latest revision of the california independent system operators isos imbalance energy market cap down to two five zero per mwh is expected to depress market prices during any weather events in september cera expects the iso price cap to limit prices outside of california as well pacific northwest although demand levels in the pacific northwest are expected to retreat in september by at least one one zero zero amw compared with those in the hotterthannormal month of august the loss in available capacity from hydroelectric resources will amount to one nine zero zero amw over the same period see table four thus the pacific northwest will be in an even more limited position to export power to other regions with transmission interties operating at below rated capacity during this period power prices in the pacific northwest will maintain their tight relationship with those in northern california these price levels will continue to support the operation of the regions limited quantity of gasfired generation midcolumbia onpeak price levels are expected to average one one eight per mwh in september offpeak power price levels in the pacific northwest will also receive a boost from the strong markets to the south the expected september level of five four per mwh represents the opportunity cost of power sales in surrounding markets california the fall months initiate a seasonal shift in price differentials that separates the west into markets that lie north of transmission path one five and those to the south as in years past hydrodepleted northern california should experience demand levels that must be served by generation resources within the region exports from the pacific northwest dwindle and energy from the nuclear and coalrich southwest is constrained from entering northern california by path one five import limitations this condition which is expected to persist from september through november allows northern california to price at a premium the expected monthly average onpeak northern california price of one two three per mwh incorporates this dynamic notably the california iso is completing a process to remap the zones in california in part to capture locational price differences more effectively southern california like the southwest will typically experience hot weather episodes in september during these high demand periods prices will rise to peak levels as experienced this summer in addition california as a whole should see average loads in september that are four six zero zero amw higher than those of september one nine nine nine occasional cooler weather will sharply but temporarily reduce daily prices southern california benefits from the abundant export capacity of the southwest during cooler weather in that region allowing prices to fall well below those in northern california an eight per mwh differential between the north and south portions of the state is expected with southern california onpeak prices averaging one one five per mwh offpeak prices of five three and four seven per mwh for northern and southern california respectively reflect the continued need for gasfired resources to support september offpeak loads rockies and southwest an extended period of hot weather in july and august has boosted demand in the rockies a region with growing saturation of residential air conditioning limited transmission capacity and a dearth of cheaper exports from surrounding regions have allowed the rockies to price temporarily at a premium to all other regions in the west a return to normal weather in september should restore the previously tight relationship of rockies prices to those in the north rockies prices are expected to fall with loads with a september monthly onpeak price average of one one three per mwh and an offpeak price average of four three per mwh cera expects southwest prices to be tightly connected to prices in southern california on a monthly average basis the two regions generally experience the same september weather patterns and a strong seven six zero zero mw transmission link between the two market centers allows them to balance loads with each other strong gas prices and occasional market tightnessinduced price runups will maintain onpeak prices at the one one five per mwh level in september offpeak prices will like those in southern california be buoyed by the high cost of gasfired generation a price level of four seven per mwh is expected for offpeak prices regional gas market drivers the summer competition for gas supply between power and storage continues in north america with gas prices reflecting the intensity of that competition even as the summer power peak subsides in september across the united states the need to continue strong storage injections and the threat of storms in the gulf will keep prices high and volatile the storage deficit now stands at approximately three five zero bcf and us storage inventories look likely to head into winter at historically low levels this critical storage situation will keep prices high despite overall declines in power loads in september cera expects a henry hub price of three nine five per mmbtu during september in the west strong power loads and the potential for power peaks persist through september especially in california overall total demand for gas is expected to decline across the west from one zero one bcf per day during august to nine eight bcf per day during september see table five this load will tend to keep intraregional differentials wide throughout the west during the month the recent price disconnects between the supplyrich rocky mountains and san juan basin and demandcharged california will persist october should bring some change in this dynamic as heating loads in the rockies begin to increase in general winter will bring a dramatic shift in regional pricing differentials throughout the west the summer pressure on rocky mountain supplies caused by high utilization rates on most export pipelines will be relieved somewhat by regional heating loads declines in flows into the san juan basin from the rockies will take some downward pressure off prices in the san juan on the other hand healthy california storage inventories should limit price premiums at topock through the heating season the startup of the new alliance pipeline which will draw gas to the midwest will support prices in the pacific northwest and california california topock continues to be the premium pricing point in north america although differentials between southern california and the henry hub subsided somewhat from peak levels near one zero zero per mmbtu before this weekends pipeline explosion total imports into california reached record levels during july total imports of five eight bcf per day eclipsed the previous high by three zero zero million cubic feet mmcf per day see table six pipeline capacity into the state during the month ran at eight three percent utilization so far in august pipeline capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate running at eight five percent these high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices in southern california and the pressure should continue during september total demand in california is expected to decline somewhat during september but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation will provide support total demand in the state should average six six bcf per day down only slightly from augusts total of six eight bcf per day flows into the state between august and september are not likely to change significantly but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand the topock differential to the henry hub should average approximately zero five zero per mmbtu for september see table seven storage inventories in the west are still healthy relative to levels in the rest of the united states but the storage surplus in the region has eroded in california inventories are running lower than last year and the deficit in the state looks likely to widen during september the end of injection season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of topock differentials to winter price spikes pacific northwest malin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that topock prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the rocky mountains and san juan basins have shown so far this month prices at malin are averaging a zero two five per mmbtu discount to the henry hub pipeline capacity into the region from the rocky mountains is running nearly full flows on pgt out of alberta have averaged nearly two two bcf per day this month export capacity out of the region on pge gt nw is running close to capacity and pipeline constraints to the south combined with strong california demand are driving the wide malintotopock differentials continuing strong demand in the south will likely keep topock prices strong and the wide northsouth differentials within the west will likely hold through september in the pacific northwest demand is expected to climb through september to one five bcf per day from one four bcf per day in august this demand level should keep malin differentials from widening from current levels for september cera expects malin prices to average zero one zero per mmbtu below the henry hub price southwest prices in the san juan basin this summer have been left behind by rising california demand although the westward pull on supplies is strong bottlenecks between california and the san juan have led to disconnects between san juan prices and topock prices pipeline capacity utilization rates on transwestern and the northern leg of el paso reached nine three percent during july with less than two zero zero mmcf per day of excess pipeline capacity increased flows from the rockies on transcolorado and northwest are contributing to downward pressure on san juan basin supply and in general the san juan has followed rocky mountain prices rather than following prices at topock or the permian basin unlike in the past two summers the bottleneck has not allowed power demand on the west coast to support san juan prices relative to permian prices the differential between san juan and permian has averaged zero five zero per mmbtu so far this month and zero three zero per mmbtu since june additional imports from the rockies into the san juan have increased supply by two zero zero mmcf per day relative to last summer but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect without much change in southwestern or rocky mountains local demand the san juan should continue to price at a wide discount during september the san juantohenry hub differential is expected to average zero six zero per mmbtu as in the rockies differentials should narrow substantially in october rocky mountains downward pressures on rocky mountain prices intensified over the past month as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand within the region generation is still largely coalbased and the demand impact on gas of the additional load is minimal cera expects the heavy discountcurrent rocky mountaintohenry hub differentials are around zero nine zero per mmbtuto persist through september local area demand is not expected to change during september substantial gain in local demand comes in october with heating loads october demand should average one four bcf per day up from august and september averages of around one two bcf per day although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the rockies winter differentials are expected to stay in the zero two five to zero four zero per mmbtu range strong storage inventories will limit the connection with broader north american markets this summer next summer pressures on rockies supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer although pipeline expansion projects have been announcedtrailblazer and williams announced expansion plans this summerthe new capacity will not be online to relieve constraints next summer cera expects supplies within the rocky mountains to increase by three zero zero mmcf per day next year western canada after widening to over usone five zero per mmbtu the aecohenry differential has begun to narrow somewhat maintenance that has restricted flows has largely been responsible for the jump from zero eight four per mmbtu in july with current supply able

to be usthree two five per mmbtu cfour five three per gigajoule for september even with the startup of the alliance project the contract nonrenewal on transcanada is likely to continue the twotiered

____________________________________ financial summary powerball international inc the company was formed in july one nine nine seven for the purpose of raising capital to invest in a joint venture to develop certain technology relating to the production of hydrogen to generate hydrogen for sale and to market hydrogen generating equipment and products during two zero zero zero the company acquired the remaining interest in the joint venture powerball technologies llc tech which is now operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company the company through tech is involved in research and development efforts of commercializing the technology powerball expects that initial revenues will be generated primarily by the construction of a commercial sodium plant in green river wyoming additional revenues may be derived from the licensing of the technology andor manufacturing and sale of hydrogen generation systems powerball had no revenues for the three and six months ended june three zero two zero zero one and two zero zero zero respectively and has had no revenues since july nine one nine nine seven for the three and nine months ended september three zero two zero zero one powerball had total operating expenses of one four six four five five and four three three five five zero respectively compared to one two six eight three one and two nine three zero two six for the three and nine month period ended september three zero two zero zero zero the increase in operating expenses is attributable primarily to a substantial increase in research and development costs of three two two zero one and two one five three nine one respectively offset by small decreases in general and administrative expenses eight zero seven zero and eight five zero eight respectively and professional fees one six one three and one zero six one two respectively the increase in research and development costs reflects the companys acquisition of one zero zero ownership of powerball technologies llc tech in the second quarter of fiscal two zero zero zero and consequent responsibility for all the research costs associated with tech as a result of the merger tech is the wholly owned subsidiary of the company and all the expenses of tech are consolidated with those expenses of the company the company expects that it will continue to incur operational losses for the next twelve months primarily as a result of expenditures related to the operation of the pilot sodium plant in west valley city utah and the general overhead thereto the company believes that the pilot plant will demonstrate successful completion of the milestones set for it before the end of two zero zero one once continuous operation and product quality have been verified in the pilot plant and industrial revenue development bond funding obtained construction may begin on the commercial sodium facility in wyoming that will produce initial revenues ____________________________________

technologies at the heart of its technology is the proprietary hydride pellets or powerballstm which dramatically increase the storage density and distribution efficiency for hydrogen through incremental and ondemand production of hydrogen for a wide range of applications from industrial hydrogen to portable fuel cell systems a revolutionary technology for the production of sodium metal from sodium hydroxide using natural gas energy is being demonstrated in a pilot plant facility sodium metal as produced by this recycling plant will be used in the manufacture of sodium hydride which can be pelletized and individually encapsulated with polyethylene plastic for the highly dense yet safe storage and distribution of hydrogen hydrogen gas is produced incrementally and upon demand through the use of a patented portable hydrogen generator system the plastic coated pellets are sliced open one at a time within the generator to provide hydrogen as needed a gallon of sodium hydride is capable of producing one three zero seven gallons of hydrogen gas which is an equivalent hydrogen storage density more than six four times greater by volume than a compressed hydrogen tank storing hydrogen at three zero zero zero psi since the powerball fuel pellets can be delivered and utilized at near room temperature and pressure the usual problems and costs for highly pressurized hydrogen or cryogenically stored hydrogen can be safely eliminated additionally the pellets are considerably more energy dense and can provide hydrogen for an end user at a cost less than through the more traditional means of delivering hydrogen an exciting future potential use for powerball fuel pellets is for the supply of hydrogen to fuel cell vehicles to supply hydrogen fuel as powerball plastic coated hydride pellets is unique more conventional methods for supplying a fuel to a vehicle usually require that a hydrocarbon is pumped from the ground refined and then burned onboard the vehicle to provide energy there are a number of problems with a business as usual approach to fuel supplies for vehicles one more than one two of all transportation fuel for vehicles is currently imported from other countries which makes the usa potentially vulnerable to and dependant upon other foreign countries two as hydrocarbons are burned onboard vehicles either by reformers or by combustion engines the cotwo emissions are exhausted into the atmosphere more than six two zero zero million metric tons of carbon as cotwo waste is exhausted into our air each year the incredibly large amounts of cotwo waste are beginning to have costly environmental impacts on our planet three as hydrocarbon fuels are transferred from refineries into trucks from trucks into tanks at fuel stations and from fuel stations into vehicles a large amount of hydrocarbon emissions are produced which contribute to unhealthy air with negative impacts on health to millions of people living in cities around the world four hydrocarbon fuels are produced by the earth at a rate more than one zero zero zero zero zero zero times slower than we are consuming them which means that hydrocarbons are a nonrenewable resource powerball fuel pellets can be produced using a variety of energy sources powerballs current recycling plant is powered by natural gas when natural gas is used to produce powerballs cotwo is produced conveniently cotwo from a central plant can be stored unlike cotwo produced onboard a vehicle which cannot be stored and must be exhausted into the atmosphere even more exciting is that solar energy wind energy hydroelectric energy or even fusion power if developed could be used to produce powerballs since powerballs are merely an energy storage medium and not an energy source whatever energy source is available can be used to produce the coated fuel pellets powerball technology if used on a large scale nationally would enable the usa to produce its own fuel for vehicles without having to rely on other nations for oil we have large supplies of natural gas in the usa which can be used to produce nah powerballs from waste naoh additionally as powerballs are shipped stored or transferred from tank to tank there would be zero harmful hydrocarbon emissions polyethylene coated pellets cannot evaporate and neither naoh solution or water produces harmful emissions the cost for producing powerballs from waste naoh and recycled polyethylene ball shells is greatly reduced by producing very large volumes of pellets powerball is focused on the production of hydride pellets in large volumes from waste naoh as the technology is improved and as the production volumes increase the powerball pellets will represent an inexpensive alternative source of hydrogen for hydrogen customers who currently receive hydrogen in bulky and expensive compressed hydrogen tube trailers eventually as very large volumes of fuel pellets are produced the pelletized fuel along with ordinary tap water could one day become the infrastructure fuel of choice for fuel cell vehicles web site wwwpowerballnet for more see expanded business description wwwtheinvestoronlinecomresearchprblbusdeschtm ____________________________________ analyst summary the powerball concept allows for cheap easy and safe storage of hydrogen and requires very little in the way of specialized storage there are no special temperature or compression considerations that need to be worried about princeton university chemistry department the concept behind powerball technologies is to tame energy so to speak and to store one powerful element sodium or sodium hydride in order to later get hydrogen on demand powerballtm fuel pellets store and produce hydrogen on demand each gallon of powerball fuel pellets produces hundreds of gallons of hydrogen upon contact with water on an asneeded basis powerball fuel pellets offer a safe compact and inexpensive alternative to the delivery storage and use of compressed or liquid hydrogen for a wide range of applications which require a clean source of hydrogen powerball fuel pellets are not an energy source the company will never drill a hole in the ground and discover a large reserve of hydrogen or hydride pellets instead fuel pellets can be used as an efficient energy carrier the hydride pellets can be produced using energy from diverse energy sources all over the world such as biomass natural gas wind energy hydroelectric power and solar energy because they are safe and energy dense they can be distributed to buses boats houses and hydrogen users by rail sea or highway powerball fuel pellets offer new options for the distribution of energy that do not rely on oil pipelines or electricity transmission lines even a disruption in a natural gas pipeline for instance would not preclude the distribution of powerball fuel pellets via trucks trains or ships to where energy is needed additionally when powerballs are used to provide hydrogen to vehicles or stationary applications there are no pointofuse hydrocarbon emissions or cotwo emissions when powerballs are transferred from one tank into another tank there are also zero emissions therefore powerball fuel pellets are a responsible and environmentally friendly energy carrier powerball is currently in the research and development stage in preparation for commercializing

increased volume one five four of average suggesting a continuation higher on the next bar short term opinion hold on a shortterm technical basis the trend is bullish up and the stock is above its five zero day moving average at three four two which also confirms its bullish up trend the stock is extremely overbought according to the stochastic indicator eight four one zero so look for a possible pullback long term opinion hold on a longterm technical basis the stock prbl is trading below its two zero zero day moving average which implies it is in a negative trend the stock has broken down through support at five five six so look for new support at four three four the stock has support at four three four and four zero nine if the stock breaks down through support at four three four then it will probably continue lower to four zero nine the stock has resistance at five one zero and at five five six if the stock breaks up through resistance at five one zero then it will probably continue higher to five five six the two zero zero day moving average is at five one zero this will also act as resistance please go to httptiobuysellorholdcomisapidelstockgifdllsymprbledate one one

royjshankerworldnetattnet writes to the nyiso_tech_exchange discussion list i agree with mark further in setting the baseline the lolp study obviously assumed an annual structure for maintenance scheduling and a lack of diversity in terms of outage rates for summer versus winter these assumptions no longer are valid if the time step for planning becomes a capability period each reliability period would have to stand on its own and you would have to entirely redo the assumptions about scheduled outages and come up with seasonal availabilities my guess is that given the incentive to be around in the summer for the higher energy payments these values should be highly skewed finally lets also just cut to the chase even if this study were correct in its current form what obviously is going on is an attempt to evade five zero of the deficiency charge applying this type of argument on seasonal installed requirement to deficiency payments just doesnt fly if you believe that the current values for the deficiency payments are correct to begin with it would make sense to me to at minimum allocate the deficiency charges by the lolp incurrence eg if nine zero of the annual lolp is in the summer period then nine zero of the deficiency should probably follow this allocation remember the incentive is to force people to build the cost of being short ever really should stay the same or you diminish the incentive and thus undercut the entire reliability structure roy j shanker nine zero zero nine burning tree road bethesda md two zero eight one seven three zero one three six

the summer and winter icap requirements are based upon the summer peak load basing the winter icap requirement on the winter peak load would be a substantial change in the icap market if we are going to consider a change in this direction then we also have to apply most of the annual deficiency rate to the summer period original message from ownernyiso_tech_exchangelistsone thebiznet

nypa studywinter locational icap requirements file nypa_lr_wintpdf file tran_sys_zero zero one one two nine pdf at nypas request iso staff conducted a limited analysis of the winter locational icap requirements for long island and new york city areas while such icap requirements have historically been set as a single number for the entire year it is nypas belief that this holdover from the old way of doing business must be reexamined it is nypas belief that most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the summer months as such some reduction in winter icap requirements should be possible with no impact on the loss of load criterion of one day in ten years nypa requested that the iso start with the database that resulted in the locational requirements of eight zero and nine eight for new york city and long island respectively at nypas request the iso modeled winter ratings on the transmission interfaces into nyc and li and determined how much the eight zero and nine eight could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the statewide loss of load occurred the report indicates that winter requirements of seven five and nine two of the summer peak load resulted for nyc and li respectively while this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter locational requirements the results from this study suggest that some reduction in the winter requirement may be warranted and a consideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future icap requirement studies nypa believes that having an icap requirement for summer and winter seasons based on the lses peak load for the respective season would send the proper icap price signal nypa is sharing the study results in the attached report in an effort to begin a dialog which we
