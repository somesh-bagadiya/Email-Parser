company believes it can repay about three three billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities known as the marlin water trust ii the marlin water capital corp ii the osprey trust and osprey i inc the notes are coming due during the next two zero months mr glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes also enron is selling other assets proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes which ultimately are guaranteed by enron he said it appears that asset sales will raise at least two two billion by the end of next year this amount includes cash proceeds of one five five billion from the previously announced sale of enrons portland general electric utility unit enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of two zero zero two there are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds to repay the notes mr glisan said but if we are wrong we will issue equity mr glisan said a worstcase scenario would involve issuing as much as one billion in stock enron said it

composite trading enron shares were down eight six cents to one nine seven nine the stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about two seven million shares changing hands early this year enron stock was more than eight zero a share during the past week shares of the energytrading giant have dropped more than four zero early last week enron reported a six one eight million thirdquarter loss resulting from one zero one billion in writeoffs the company also disclosed a one two billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by enron chief financial officer andrew s fastow in july mr fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors on monday enron disclosed that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the transactions related to mr fastow enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper the turmoil of the past several days prompted enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with wall street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors enron chairman and chief executive kenneth lay said while we are extremely disappointed with our stock price our businesses are performing very well mr lay and other executives said enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs mr fastow the chief financial officer took part in the conference call but neither he nor mr lay would answer any questions concerning the fastowrelated partnership which was known as ljmtwo coinvestment lp mr lay said the sec was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement which has raised conflictofinterest questions among analysts and others mr lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions mr lay said he was very concerned about the way andys character has been loosely tossed about he added we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy internal ljmtwo documents indicate that mr fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership billions of dollars of enron assets and stock were involved in ljmtwo related transactions according to enron sec filings during the conference call analysts even some who have been longtime enron fans challenged executives about the fastow partnership arrangement and the companys often opaque financial reports theres the appearance you are hiding something said goldman sachs analyst david fleischer you need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board mr lay responded

one zero two four two zero zero one the new york times page one column five c two zero zero one new york times company enron has ample access to cash the companys chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional writeoffs stemming from unusual financing activities in a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after enrons stock plunged on monday the chief executive kenneth w lay strongly defended the companys chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the securities and exchange commission was looking into but he refused to go into detail on the transaction that enron made with partnerships run by andrew s fastow the chief financial officer in addition mr fastow while declaring that enron expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations declined to answer any questions about it the conference call which began just as trading opened on the new york stock exchange at first seemed to be reassuring investors within minutes of the beginning of the call the share price rallied to two three two five but it soon began falling and ended the day down eight six cents at one nine seven nine the days low of one nine six two was the lowest since jan one two one nine nine eight and was down seven eight percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of two zero zero zero until recently most investors focused on the companys reported operating earnings which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets but the focus has shifted to a series of transactions some involving offbalancesheet financing one involving partnerships controlled by mr fastow led to a one two billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to sec inquiries that the company disclosed on monday one of the companys strongest supporters has been david fleischer an analyst at goldman sachs but he told mr lay on the call yesterday that enron had to be more forthcoming with information there is an appearance that you are hiding something he said after the call mr fleischer expressed disappointment theyve engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about and that are hard to understand he said in an interview they have not been as forthcoming in explaining them as is needed he said but he said he was still recommending the stock i dont think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans he said in the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company there is tremendous value here mr lay cited the sec inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by mr fastow but he emphasized that both he and the companys board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy mr lay said that auditors from arthur andersen had carefully reviewed enrons reporting in conjunction with another offbalancesheet vehicle called marlin that company owns onethird of azurix an enron subsidiary that owns wessex a british water utility the auditors have determined there is no writedown required he said under questioning by richard grubman of highfields capital management a money management firm mr grubman said that marlin owed almost one billion on debt that was guaranteed by enron but had no assets other than the azurix stake noting that enron had paid about three zero zero million to buy a third of azurix from public shareholders and had since taken writedowns on its investment in azurix mr grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of enron shares mr lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details eventually he cut off mr grubman i know youre trying to drive the stock price down and youve done a pretty good job of it mr lay said but lets move on to the next question mr fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had one eight five billion in such debt outstanding he said it was backed by three three five billion in bank lines of credit of which one seven five billion will expire next may if it is not renewed mr lay said he was sorry about the misunderstanding that resulted when his brief mention of the one two billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts that reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report but it did not he said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future but made no promises the large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings and so was not in the earnings release but it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement the sec is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct after one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as marlin mr lay said the company will look into providing such statements copyright two zero zero zero dow jones company inc all rights reserved options report surge in optimism prompts straddles in enron and cisco by kopin tan dow jones newswires one zero

mailtochristimcrowedunlevycom sent tuesday october one six two zero zero one one zero zero two am to hartrickalumniriceedu timwestdvncom jlarmourearthlinknet hollimosstrasburgercom cc phmartilsuedu david winn subject re membership reportfriday meeting in preparation for our meeting this friday i wanted to describe my concerns with regard to one particular aspect of the membership committee report the issue that i am the most concerned about is the idea of forced rotation and limited terms on the advisory board to state up front the conclusion i try to explain below in what is admittedly too long of an explanation that probably tries to anticipate too many of the likely counterconcerns i would favor keeping in place the part of our current advisory board structure that enables key industry leaders as well as the same representative from a duespaying organization to remain in place on the board for as long as both one they wish to serve and two they are providing sufficient personal time or financial support or both to provide value to the center i do not oppose the removal of advisory board members who are providing neither service to the center nor financial supportunless the staff of the center advise that the appearance on our advisory board list of the names of certain key industry leaders has been of material value to the center in recruiting involvement of others without regard for whether the former actually work on or financially support projects of the center the underlying bias and beliefs from which my concerns arise are as follows while others may have reached the opposite conclusion i think the longtime participation in the swlfs leadership by some of the top leaders in the oil and gas industry without forced rotation has been a key asset and has greatly benefitted the center while the list of key leaders runs much longer than this i would note just by way of example that sheila hollis jim hardwick and stuart hollimon from the private practice sector pat martin and john lowe from the academic sector and ted frois ken dickerson and jim derrick from the general counsel sector are some of the individuals who have occupied leadership roles in the foundation for about as long as i have followed its activities closely one of the attributes which caused me to want to become actively involved in this group was the observation that the swlf had a group of key leaders in the industry who seemed to have embraced this organization as one in which they would make a longer term commitment and investment if we had a large group of new and effective leaders who were out there wanting to be involved in the leadership of the center and if the continued participation by those who have been active for a number of years was somehow blocking these newer people out of leadership roles we might have a situation that needs to be addressed however the staff of the foundationcenter have taken the lead in making sure that we have the opposite situation during the past five or so years i have seen david ellwanger david winn and mark smith provide as much encouragement and as much of an open door as anyone could provide and they have indeed made a point to aggressively recruit active participation by those who show any inkling at all of maybe being slightly inclined to become active in this group any new players who have wanted to become active are both encouraged to do so and are given leadership opportunities very quicklyand much more quickly than any other organization in which i have been involved our current system is one which eagerly welcomes new participant leaders and the staff of the center and a number of the centers leaders have been making efforts for years to encourage participation by new leaders if we have a shortage of new leaders in the center it is not due to a system or organization that discourages such participation because there are too many of us who have joined the leadership in the past five years who can attest that this group welcomed early leadership participation as quickly as any group in which we have ever been involved rather any shortage of new leader participants is due to other factors such as the declining number of oil and gas attorneys and the need to develop program content and a broader range of activities that will attract broader participation among other sectors of the energy industry that are growing instead of shrinking i have been involved in organizations that have had a forced rotation and up and out system and it has not worked well where there is not a continuing supply of new people who want to work hardnot just take on the name of the office and do nothing but actually work hardin carrying forward the initiatives of the organization while in theory the former hardworking and talented leaders are still welcome to remain active in a nonleadership capacity after they complete their cycle the general experience is that these leaders move on and choose to spend their energy with other organizations that still offer them leadership roles the aba section of environment energy and resources has an up and out system john lowe used to be the head of that section john has not been active in that group since he completed his tenure as section chair and i think the section is worse off for it i expect that sheila hollis the current chair will be likely to greatly reduce the portion of her energies that the aba receives when she completes her tenure as chair and the aba will be worse off for that as well and the aba with this system has often had great difficulty finding energy lawyers who are willing to take on leadership roles and really work for the organization i think the aba would be better off at least in the energy area if whenever they find an energy law leader who will work hard they hold on to that person as long as she or he will serve while still finding room for service in other leadership capacities for any new energy leaders who come along from time to time the up and out system may work in a satisfactory way for the state bar of texas because the oil gas and mineral law section council is relatively small in size and the state of texas uniquely will always have enough new oil and gas attorneys who want to have those positions on their resume that there will always be a supply of new hardworking people to fill the positions of the outgoing officers of that council however i am concerned that the center has a much more limited supply of ongoing new hardworking leaders to take over under an up and out system i am betting that we would continue to do better with the current system that keeps the type of individuals named above around in leadership roles as long as they are willing to actively serve while quickly making room on the board and other committees for new attorneys who show an interest in becoming leaders in the center that is the approach that has been followed in recent years and it sure looks to me to be the better approach for this organization than any of the alternatives that have been discussed,08:35:49,"Yes

reporter of the wall street journal zero nine two zero two zero zero zero the wall street journal texas journal tone copyright c two zero zero zero dow jones company inc volatile prices for natural gas and electricity are creating highvoltage earnings growth at some companies with large energytrading units but investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road shares of these companies have been on a tear lately and some of the biggest players are in houston the center of the energytrading industry dynegy incs stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at five three four three eight and now trades for four one times what analysts project the companys two zero zero zero earnings will be according to first callthomson financial shares of enron corp the largest trader of gas and electricity in north america have nearly doubled this year to eight four eight seven five or six zero times earnings meanwhile el paso energy corps stock has jumped six one this year to six two three seven five or two four times earnings traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional markets naturalgas prices have more than doubled in the past year while supplies have tightened and the rapid price fluctuations for electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or fixedprice contracts generating large premiums for traders but what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies recent profits constitute unrealized noncash gains frequently these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors the details of which the companies do not provide and which time may prove wrong and because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases its difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions and force earnings revisions there could be a qualityofearnings issue says tom linsmeier an associate professor of accounting at michigan state university who coauthored the us securities and exchange commissions rules on marketrisk disclosures for financial instruments there certainly might be great volatility that could cause what now looks like a winning lockedin gain to not arise sometime in the future the companies reject any suggestion that there may be quality problems with their earnings but at the heart of the situation is an accounting technique that allows companies to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize from energyrelated contracts and other derivative instruments in future periods sometimes stretching over more than two zero years socalled marktomarket accounting is mandated by accountingrule makers when companies have outstanding energyrelated contracts on their books at the end of a quarter such as agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over a period of time at certain prices under those rules companies estimate the fair market values of those contracts on their balance sheets each quarter as assets or liabilities changes in the value of a contract from quarter to quarter then are either added to or subtracted from net earnings if for instance the market price for natural gas rises above the price specified in a companys contract to buy gas generally the company will record an unrealized gain that gain is recognized as income and recorded as an asset on the companys balance sheet at the end of each quarter the contract is revalued the value of the previously recorded asset is increased and any increase in unrealized gain is recorded as additional income conversely if the market value for gas falls and the value of the contract has declined any change in the contracts value is recorded on the companys balance sheet and a loss is recorded on its income statement e yet in their financial reports the companies only vaguely describe the methods they use to come up with fairvalue estimates on the contracts increasingly quoted market prices offering independent guidance are becoming readily available for several years into the future however with some longterm derivative instruments particularly electricity contracts future market prices dont extend far enough to cover the full life of those contracts and in those cases companies are allowed to base valuations on their own undisclosed estimates assumptions and pricing models ultimately theyre telling you what they think the answer is but theyre not telling you how they got to that answer says stephen campbell an analyst at business valuation services in dallas that is essentially saying trust me accountingrule makers at the financial accounting standards board have debated the subject of how to value energyrelated contracts extensively in recent months two companies in similar circumstances might apply different methods to estimate the fair value of their energyrelated contracts and may arrive at widely different values an fasb task force studying the issue wrote in a june report those differences lead to the question of whether some of the methods in practice yield estimated amounts that are not representative of fair value despite this concern fasb isnt inclined to offer any explicit guidance for how such contracts should be valued there are just too many models and too many different types of instruments for us to have a onesizefitsall type of model explains timothy lucas fasbs director of research in norwalk conn one way to determine the size of a companys unrealized gains is to compare the change in the values of net assets from riskmanagement activities from quarter to quarter some companies also disclose how much theyre adjusting their cashflow statements to reflect unrealized gains that have been booked as earnings thats how one can determine the size of the unrealized gains at dynegy and enron for example the two companies confirm a reporters examination of dynegys financial filings shows the companys earnings are highly dependent on unrealized gains from riskmanagement activities for its most recent quarter ended june three zero dynegy reported earnings of three eight cents a diluted share seven one of which came from unrealized gains the company confirms the companys pershare earnings would have been two zero cents higher if not for a onetime stock dividend for all of one nine nine nine dynegy recorded one one five million in unrealized gains accounting for five one of its earnings enron confirms it booked seven four seven million in unrealized gains from riskmanagement activities during the second quarter more than the companys total six zero nine million in earnings before interest and taxes absent unrealized gains the company would have reported a quarterly loss for the quarter the company reported earnings of three four cents a diluted share up two six from a year earlier but not all companies disclose enough information for investors to calculate how large their unrealized gains are el paso says thats the case with its own quarterly reports which disclose shortterm assets and liabilities from riskmanagement activities but not longterm riskmanagement assets and liabilities for the second quarter el paso reported that its energy marketing and trading unit earned one five two million before interest and taxes two four times what it earned a year earlier in an interview el pasos chief financial officer brent austin says unrealized gains represented about a third of that total he says most of the cash from those gains will materialize within a year in its financial reports dynegy highlights the uncertainties with some contract valuations it explains that with some longterm contracts for which marketprice quotes arent available the lack of longterm pricing liquidity requires the use of mathematical models to value these commitments using historical market data to forecast future elongated pricing curves dynegy cautions that actual cash returns may vary either positively or negatively from the results estimated but like enron el paso and others dynegy provides scant details about its mathematical models such as the assumptions they use for market volatility and longterm price forecasts for natural gas and electricity nor is the company required to disclose more the disclosure mentions risks says john cassidy an analyst who tracks dynegy for moodys investors service in new york but i dont know that the disclosure offers enough detail for you to be able to quantify how much risk there is el pasos filings warn that because the valuation of these financial instruments can involve estimates changes in the assumptions underlying these estimates can occur changing our valuation and potentially resulting in financial losses enron cautions that the values it assigns to various transactions are based on managements best estimate the companies are required to disclose what they think their maximum potential singleday riskmanagement losses might be figures that also are based on various undisclosed market assumptions but energy traders cite competitive reasons for not disclosing more you dont necessarily want to tip off everyone to what youre doing says john harrison chief financial officer for el pasos merchantenergy unit echoing remarks by executives at other energy traders enrons executive vice president and chief accounting officer richard causey says enron runs a relatively balanced portfolio and that the estimates factored into his companys valuations are conservative in large part he says those estimates are based on quoted market prices where available where theyre not available mr causey says enron bases its estimates in part on longterm pricing trends as well as the companys own trading experience which dates to one nine nine zero further mr causey says enrons unrealized gains dont depend heavily on gains from longterm contracts that extend beyond the periods for which market quotes are available reducing the potential for significant earnings revisions the average length of enrons riskmanagement contracts is just two years he says to be sure though some of enrons electricity contracts extend for two five years were getting the cash in quicker than you might think mr causey says they dont stay unrealized very long el paso says its contracts have an average life of six years with some running as long as two zero years dynegy says the longest riskmanagement contracts for which it uses marktomarket accounting are one zero years though it doesnt disclose an average length dynegys chief financial officer robert doty says nine six of the companys gas contracts close out by two zero zero two while seven five of its power contracts expire by two zero zero three the cash will come in he says as for why the company doesnt disclose the extent of any bias bullish or bearish it has in the market dynegy executives say that information like the estimates behind its mathematical models is proprietary such disclosures may be outdated anyway by the time they could be included in public financial filings says michael mott a dynegy vice president mr mott further explains that dynegy could be realizing more cash earnings now if it wanted to but we dont see that would be in the best interests of shareholders mr mott says because the company figures it can earn more later by leaving much of its gains unrealized for now mr linsmeier of michigan state compares the current situation for energy traders with the accounting controversies that engulfed subprime automobile and residential lenders during the late one nine nine zero s though he emphasizes its too far early to tell whether the consequences will be similar using socalled gainonsale accounting a form of marktomarket accounting those lenders booked earnings from loans as soon as they were made rather than having to wait for them to be paid off as banks typically do but as interest rates fell in one nine nine eight many customers paid off their loans earlier than expected slashing lenders profit margins compounding matters the market for mortgagebacked securities dried up in the wake of financial chaos in russia and other foreign markets leaving lenders to bear the higher risks of many new loans many investors complained they were blindsided in part because these lenders generally hadnt disclosed their assumptions about prepayment rates and other variables after the crash subprime lenders routinely began disclosing the key assumptions used to value their mortgage portfolios at new york university accounting professor baruch lev says investors would be better served if energy traders financial filings explained the effects of hypothetical commodityprice movements on the values of their riskmanagement assets and disclosed the basic assumptions about future commodityprice movements ingrained in their mathematical models says mr lev i would like to see much more disclosure particularly given that this is now becoming a significant component of their earnings copyright two zero zero zero dow jones company inc all rights reserved,03:08:00,No

worth remembering that given a choice we would not be entering into this posting agreement the historical agreement with mg dictates many of the variances we will see from your other posting agreements given the short time frame here justin is in the process of trying to set up a call with travis and you for later today i have tried to address a couple of the points you raise below regards bruce andy zipperenron one one two seven two zero zero zero zero nine four nine pm to justin boydlonectect bruce garnerlonectect cc subject emetra posting agreement i have read and reviewed the posting agreement let me preface my comments by saying that im sure there is stuff in the posting agreement that i am missing and i really want travis mccullough to review it im also curious as to why in certain sections it is faithful to the agreement i sent and in other places seems to stray or omits things anyway here are my comments one whereas a how many emetra platforms are there what does collectively the platforms mean the agreement should be specific as to which platforms emetra can display prices on there are two platforms one physical and one financial the primary focus of this agreement is on financial platform two regulatory event this language should really mirror the posting agreements in place the language should cover the situation that if any of the events mentioned subject enron or any of its affiliates to regulation it is a regulatory event even if it does not impact upon the way emetra conducts its business as contemplated by the agreement three term two two there is no time limit on the date that emetra commences lme trading given that the language is worded as the later of this leaves them with all the leverage it should be the earlier of this is a big one as they could sit around forever trying to make it work and we are still bound by an agreement that runs one eight months from forever i agree with you on this one starting the clock now does not work but we should be able to set the clock at one eight months from ap three zero two zero zero one four establishment and maintenance of interfaces four one we need to agree on who is responsible for what interfaces in this agreement upfront these were detailed in the agreement i sent to you they are to responsible for maintaining the interfaces so we do not want to build them in general we are responsible for specifying the interfaces and they are responsible for building and operating them once again please refer to the posting agreement that was sent for the exhibits detailing this five execution of transactions five one all parties agree to be bound by enrons general terms and conditions we can discuss on the phone call six execution of transactions five two three please use the exact language from the posting agreement sent this wording is unclear there is no time of transacting as there is no transaction unless price and volume are available at time of receipt of proposed transaction seven execution of transactions general comment there is no language referring to emetra taking responsibility for mapping errors this is a big issue we will not be responsible if they incorrectly display our prices ie three mo aluminium displayed as six mo aluminium please refer to posting agreement for language i agree eight cooperation seven two and seven three i would like to see both of these deleted we have not given this to anyone else and it seems to be indirect conflict with one three this section pretty much rules out that we market enrononline to our customers and i dont see how we can live with it i think we would be willing to substitute some form of nondisparagement language in its place we are balancing a couple of issues here some of this is specific for emetra john sherriff has been involved in the business issues that have been agreed to not withstanding the support of emetra we believe we have the freedom to market eol and are released from the noncompete nine default and termination nine one one how is the release from the noncompete tied to breach of this agreement there is no link between breach under this agreement and noncompete one zero default and termination nine one one strike the term material from sentence all parts of this agreement are material or they wouldnt be in it fine one one default and termination nine one four and enron operational failure this is too broad only the failure of an aspect of the enron platform that affects participants ability to conduct business with enron through emetra is relevant fine one two cost and expenses emetra bears all costs relating to connectivity ie tone s between emetra to the enron platform fine one three assignment should read emetras right to display enrons prices fine as i said earlier im sure there are things i ve left out and strongly suggest that travis review it before signing thanks andy,03:32:00,No

article on UBS acquisition,wsjone one four ubs emerges as top bidder for enron trading unit zero one one four two zero zero two dow jones news services copyright two zero zero two dow jones company inc by mitchell pacelle and rebecca smith staff reporters of the wall street journal ubs ag the giant swiss financial firm emerged the apparent victor to acquire enron corps north american energytrading operation enron hopes the deal will breathe new life into its dormant trading business once the generator of nine zero of the houston companys profit but obstacles to resurrecting the business remain formidable as indicated by the fact there were only two serious bidders ubs and citigroup inc enron wouldnt see any serious money from the ubs deal for at least a year indicating how difficult it will be for the energy companys creditors to recover what they are owed enron filed for chapter one one bankruptcycourt protection on dec two the largest such filing ever shielding the company from creditors as it seeks to reorganize under the terms of the deal which is subject to bankruptcycourt approval enron would transfer to ubs warburg the investment banking arm of ubs its wholesale energytrading operation including a staff of roughly eight zero zero people and computer systems and hardware that comprised its oncemighty enrononline internetbased trading platform ubs wouldnt be acquiring any of enrons huge book of trading positions which gradually would be unwound it also wouldnt provide any cash upfront to enron instead ubs would pay royalties to enron amounting to onethird of the energytrading enterprises pretax profit for a one zero year period according to enron ubs would have an option to eliminate the royalty payments through the payment to enron of money in years three four and five ubs would pay enron five seven five times enrons prioryear payment for each onethird share of royalty eliminated as such it could completely eliminate enrons royalty payments by the end of the fifth year as incentive to buy out enron ubss royalty payments otherwise would increase by one zero from years five through one zero up to a maximum of four four share of pretax profit enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said yesterday that he felt it was a grandslam great deal for creditors since new life is being breathed into a perishable commodity enrons staff had been kept together largely on the basis of retention bonuses that expire at the end of february the trading operation effectively suspended operations prior to enrons chapter one one filing last month enron had hoped to bring in a creditworthy partner to take a five one stake in a new trading joint venture leaving the energy company with a four nine stake but mr mcmahon said no bidder was interested in that deal there also were no bids for the trading operation from rival energy or energytrading companies one possible reason was that resuscitating enrons vast trading business would require a top credit rating lots of capital to back trading operations and an expert creditrisk department to keep track of what traders are doing and to constantly revalue the trading book since the enron debacle other energytrading firms have taken pains to show they are deemphasizing commoditylike trading of electricity which enron pioneered and are instead concentrating on selling their own output of energy products and entering into contracts to protect themselves against price volatility mr mcmahon said he feels that by virtue of a aaplus bank purchasing this business it changes the landscape of the energymerchant business forever by putting more clout in the hands of institutions with top credit ratings ubs apparently hasnt committed to provide any set level of capital there is no determination yet for how royalty payments would be divided among enrons thousands of creditors the largest question though is whether the trading business can truly be revived although enrons global wholesale division which included as its biggest component the north american energytrading operations generated about three billion in pretax profit during the first nine months of two zero zero one it has been dormant now for more than a month martin bienenstock enrons lead bankruptcy lawyer characterized the deal as the sale of something that was dead that we are trying to bring back to life competitors say they think a certain amount of enrons trades were conducted at very thin margins in order to build volume and that such trading practice likely will disappear youll see the churn going away says michael mcnally chief financial officer of txu corp now the biggest electricity trader in texas he thinks enrononline has significant value but theres only a limited number of people who would know how to use it scaled to transact trades on hundreds of types of contracts the platform is oversized for most uses ubs warburg which bought painewebber in two zero zero zero has looked to expand its us market share and the enron deal would provide entry into energy trading john costas chief executive of ubs warburg said friday the enron unit would be a valuable extension of our worldwide trading activities the winner of the auction held under the bankruptcy courts supervision was announced shortly after noon friday in a packed manhattan courtroom less than an hour after the two bidders had submitted final offers enrons advisers and its creditors committee which endorsed the ubs deal had negotiated nonstop for more than two four hours in addition to citigroup which mr mcmahon said competed neck and neck with ubs bp plc the british oil company had submitted a two five million bid for the computer settlement support system of the enron unit the proposed ubs transaction is subject to approval by judge arthur j gonzalez of the us bankruptcy court of the southern district of new york who officially closed the auction to new bidders friday a hearing is set for thursday at which creditors will have an opportunity to voice objections separately friday judge gonzalez declined to transfer the bankruptcy case to houston denying motions from several creditors

scottetsenron on one one two seven two zero zero zero zero six two seven pm susan scott one one two seven two zero zero zero zero six two eight pm to drew fossumenron maria pavlouetsenronenron cc subject recourse rate dilemma the sequel maria and drew this is a longwinded email but please bear with me the problem as you probably remember several months ago several of us met to discuss the following language in the rofr portion of transwesterns tariff if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate and the additional frustrating language all available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures at our last meeting we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that tw could capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate to index prices however since this usually involves an unacceptable amount of risk to both the shipper and tw the marketers havent done any indexbased rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals i have been asked by the commercial group to revisit this issue and to think of other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum rate ideally they would like to eliminate the language ive quoted above however my research has indicated that absent our one bringing about radical change in the way ferc thinks about recourse rates or two showing that tw lacks market power we are probably stuck with this language why the problem exists you may already know steve stojic and i did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in the first place in the alternative rates policy statement rmnine five six zero zero zero the commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for negotiated rates but only where customers retain the ability to choose a costofservice based tariff rates the availability of a recourse service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that the customer can fall back to costbased traditional service if the pipeline unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service thus the recourse rate mitigates market power the commission went on to confirmed that under rofr provisions the highest rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate this policy is clearly not limited to rofr situations when capacity is constrained a shipper willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate when there are more requests for capacity than there is capacity available then the pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate for example on a pro rata basis if required by its tariff the example cited by the commission if a pipeline has one zero zero dthd available and two shippers request that capacity one who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of five and another a negotiated rate of six then each would be allocated five zero dthd on a pro rata basis assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some other allocation method such as lottery when tw filed for authority to charge negotiated rates it voluntarily added the statement that if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate presumably we had concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order to receive negotiated rate authority solutions i would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language outright is probably out of the question i feel as if ive really been chasing my tail here i have owed lindy an answer for some time now but i keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power which drew is where i believe you were headed when we talked about this in midoctober steve harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system i think we would still have to show lack of market power in order to do this do you agree stojic warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive proposition might be worth it to us though another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more than max rate after all we do have authority to charge negotiated rates weve seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more than max rates for it space based on good customer relations alone however despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers its unlikely we can pull this off with any consistency we wondered whether we might be able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure but i just am not convinced we could get around the commissions requirement that recourse rates be available that requirement has not changed have either of you seen anything to the contrary i would like to meet with you two plus several others i have in mind to discuss this preferably early this week tues or wed but would like to discuss briefly with you first please call me so we can talk for a few minutes thanks,10:34:00,"Yes

fear the companys bond rating might fall to th e junk level what happened it will take months if not years to untangle the details but it is clear that the main culprit was greed closely followed by hubris two zero not too many years ago enron was a small struggling gas pipeline company in houston as deregulation spread to more and more states enron began acq uiring pipelines gas producers and utilitiestwo zero it also acquired friends in high places especially the bush family and the ir key political advisers and it discovered it could make money faster by selling and trading energy than

consumers of tens of billions of dollars enron was one of the fir st power barons to take advantage of californias flawed deregulation law virtually written by instate and outof state utility companiestwo zero the california fiasco soured probably most americans on utility deregulat ion but enron was not singled out for calumny and management saw no reaso n to examine its business

diversification is enough some risk is inherent in even the broadest por tfolio this is called market or systematic risk over the past seven five year s market risk as measured in standard deviation has been about two zero percen t in other words in twothirds of the years the annual return of the sp has fallen into a band ranging from two zero points lower to two zero points higher tha n its average return of one one percent that is between a loss of nine percent an d a gain of three one percent thats still volatile but if you invest in stocks you have to live with ittwo zero what you dont have to live with is anything more volatile so your objecti ve in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avo id what is called idiosyncratic or extra risk a portfolio with just a few stocks or one like mccalls that is overloaded in a single sector ha s lots of idiosyncratic risk in one nine seven seven an influential study found that inve stors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just two zero stocks in a wide variety of sectors in fact owning eight or one zero stocks depressed risk sharplytwo zero recently however the market has appeared to be far more volatile and a n ew study by a group of economists headed by john campbell of harvard found that many more stocks were needed around five zero to bring a portfolio down to the same level of riskiness as the broad market what campbells group found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become more volatile in the one nine nine zero s but that stocks within those sectors had so yo u need to own more of themtwo zero but owning five zero stocks is a pain in the neck and it brings up the buffett lynch admonitions about too much diversification it is hard just to

mention enronstyle accounting sh enanigans signs that its time to selltwo zero one good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual fun ds and stocks for example you might want to put five zero percent of the money y ou have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the sp itself like va nguard index five zero zero which charges rockbottom expenses and guarantees that ri sk wont exceed systematic levels you could also consider a broad fund tha ts managed by human beings such as meridian value or baron growth which are recommended by sheldon jacobs editor of the noload

two one only nine per cent of global fund managers believe equities will be lower in one two months accord ing to a merrill lynch survey published this week but the legacy of the late one nine nine

four five bn of writedowns but curiously made no provisions against the skyhigh one three one bn it paid for thirdgeneration mobile phone licences in two zero zero zero two zero such payments argued sir christopher gent vodafones chief executive we re merely what the market demanded at the time it is interesting to note too that paul klemperer the oxford professor who is an expert in auction theory and advised the british government has defended the disastrous ou tcome by arguing that the prices reflected the capital markets view of three g s prospects the common theme here is that it is nobodys fault if crazy pr ices are paid because they are legitimised by the stock markettwo zero marconi which is financially in a much worse state than the mobile phone g iant has written off most of the four one bn paid for us internet hardware comp anies in one nine nine nine there has also been a great deal of controversy in the us du ring the past few weeks over the nearcollapse of enron the power group be ing rescued by a takeover bid from its smaller rival dynegy there was an o bvious failure by investors and by stock market analysts to assess the true risks at enrontwo zero smart businessmen will sellat mad prices but why on earth should they buy the trouble is too many academics have developed theories of value based on rational expectations the real world is unfortunately very different two zero some of the distortions had obvious technical origins the vodafone bubble of one nine nine nine reflected the crossborder takeover of mannesmann and the artificia l weighting shortages that developed from that transaction as vodafone ball ooned in market capitalisation to reach at one stage one six per cent of the f tse one zero zero index the market price was driven not by normal corporate fundamen tals but by the desire of most fund managers to reach a market weighting at which point they were safe in terms of risk against the index benchmar ktwo zero that was the period when investment banks exploited the idea of low freefl oat new issues internet companies especially were floated off with only one five per cent of the stock made available although anything up to one zero zero per ce nt went into the indices creating serious shortages and bubble valuations changes now being made to the main stock market indices have reduced the p roblem but there remains a basic irrationality in the concept that investm ent risk resides in an index rather than in the underlying stockstwo zero takeovers have always been plagued by irrationality and indeed this is an area where academics recognise the problem over many years they have point ed out that all the benefits of deals and often more than all accrue to t he shareholders of the companies taken over while investors in the bidding companies suffer dilution investors know this and in normal market condi tions news of a takeover will depress the bidders share price but in a bu bble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria as well as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities of new equitytwo zero also it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market is high than when it is low two years ago companies such as marconi were engaged in buying sprees at daft prices now when prices are much lower h ardly any acquisitions are being made and investment banks are dismissing thousands of employees an exception to the deal famine is gold mining wh ich just happens to have been one of the stock markets strongest sectors t his yeartwo zero another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks over recent years their earningspershare forecasts for the next calendar year have been on average eight per cent too high this has not just been a mistake they have been paid to be overoptimistic admittedly attempts are being made to restructure the incentives here as the embarrassed investment ban ks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors of judgment during the bull market but it remains to be seen whether much will really changetwo zero the mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts and indeed many professional investors do not that merrill survey incidentally sho ws that fund managers on average expect no more than four per cent earnings pe r share growth over the next year while the stockbrokers analysts are sti ll clinging to the hope that it will be one five per centtwo zero a final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their ex ecutives the wrong sort of incentives the ruin of marconi may appear irrat ional when multibillionpound acquisitions are being declared worthless a fter only two years but executives with lucrative stock option plans whic h pay off if their gambles go right combined with golden goodbye and pensi on packages that are triggered if things go wrong may well consider it per fectly rational from their viewpoint to take much bigger risks than other shareholders or employees would consider acceptabletwo zero moreover sir christopher gent shareholders of vodafone will remember rec eived a controversial one zero m personal bonus last year for clinching the manne smann takeover a deal that requires one zero bn of writeoffstwo zero in normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rati onal but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window many i nvestors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly that is why many people subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of

consumers of tens of billions of dollars enron was one of the fir st power barons to take advantage of californias flawed deregulation law virtually written by instate and outof state utility

diversification is enough some risk is inherent in even the broadest por tfolio this is called market or systematic risk over the past seven five year s market risk as measured in standard deviation has been about two zero percen t in other words in twothirds of the years the annual return of the sp has fallen into a band ranging from two zero points lower to two zero points higher tha n its average return of one one percent that is between a loss of nine percent an d a gain of three one percent thats still volatile but if you invest in stocks you have to live with ittwo zero what you dont have to live with is anything more volatile so your objecti ve in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avo id what is called idiosyncratic or extra risk a portfolio with just a few stocks or one like mccalls that is overloaded in a single sector ha s lots of idiosyncratic risk in one nine seven seven an influential study found that inve stors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just two zero stocks in a wide variety of sectors in fact owning eight or one zero stocks depressed risk sharplytwo zero recently however the market has appeared to be far more volatile and a n ew study by a group of economists headed by john campbell of harvard found that many more stocks were needed around five zero to bring a portfolio down to the same level of riskiness as the broad market what campbells group found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become more volatile in the one nine nine zero s but that stocks within those sectors had so yo u need to own more of themtwo zero but owning five zero stocks is a pain in the neck and it brings up the buffett lynch admonitions about too much diversification it is hard just to

mention enronstyle accounting sh enanigans signs that its time to selltwo zero one good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual fun ds and stocks for example you might want to put five zero percent of the money y ou have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the sp itself like va nguard index five zero zero which charges rockbottom expenses and guarantees that ri sk wont exceed systematic levels you could also consider a broad fund tha ts managed by human beings such as meridian value or baron growth which are recommended by sheldon jacobs editor of the noload

two one only nine per cent of global fund managers believe equities will be lower in one two months accord ing to a merrill lynch survey published this week but the legacy of the late one nine nine

four five bn of writedowns but curiously made no provisions against the skyhigh one three one bn it paid for thirdgeneration mobile phone licences in two zero zero zero two zero such payments argued sir christopher gent vodafones chief executive we re merely what the market demanded at the time it is interesting to note too that paul klemperer the oxford professor who is an expert in auction theory and advised the british government has defended the disastrous ou tcome by arguing that the prices reflected the capital markets view of three g s prospects the common theme here is that it is nobodys fault if crazy pr ices are paid because they are legitimised by the stock markettwo zero marconi which is financially in a much worse state than the mobile phone g iant has written off most of the four one bn paid for us internet hardware comp anies in one nine nine nine there has also been a great deal of controversy in the us du ring the past few weeks over the nearcollapse of enron the power group be ing rescued by a takeover bid from its smaller rival dynegy there was an o bvious failure by investors and by stock market analysts to assess the true risks at enrontwo zero smart businessmen will sellat mad prices but why on earth should they buy the trouble is too many academics have developed theories of value based on rational expectations the real world is unfortunately very different two zero some of the distortions had obvious technical origins the vodafone bubble of one nine nine nine reflected the crossborder takeover of mannesmann and the artificia l weighting shortages that developed from that transaction as vodafone ball ooned in market capitalisation to reach at one stage one six per cent of the f tse one zero zero index the market price was driven not by normal corporate fundamen tals but by the desire of most fund managers to reach a market weighting at which point they were safe in terms of risk against the index benchmar ktwo zero that was the period when investment banks exploited the idea of low freefl oat new issues internet companies especially were floated off with only one five per cent of the stock made available although anything up to one zero zero per ce nt went into the indices creating serious shortages and bubble valuations changes now being made to the main stock market indices have reduced the p roblem but there remains a basic irrationality in the concept that investm ent risk resides in an index rather than in the underlying stockstwo zero takeovers have always been plagued by irrationality and indeed this is an area where academics recognise the problem over many years they have point ed out that all the benefits of deals and often more than all accrue to t he shareholders of the companies taken over while investors in the bidding companies suffer dilution investors know this and in normal market condi tions news of a takeover will depress the bidders share price but in a bu bble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria as well as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities of new equitytwo zero also it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market is high than when it is low two years ago companies such as marconi were engaged in buying sprees at daft prices now when prices are much lower h ardly any acquisitions are being made and investment banks are dismissing thousands of employees an exception to the deal famine is gold mining wh ich just happens to have been one of the stock markets strongest sectors t his yeartwo zero another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks over recent years their earningspershare forecasts for the next calendar year have been on average eight per cent too high this has not just been a mistake they have been paid to be overoptimistic admittedly attempts are being made to restructure the incentives here as the embarrassed investment ban ks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors of judgment during the bull market but it remains to be seen whether much will really changetwo zero the mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts and indeed many professional investors do not that merrill survey incidentally sho ws that fund managers on average expect no more than four per cent earnings pe r share growth over the next year while the stockbrokers analysts are sti ll clinging to the hope that it will be one five per centtwo zero a final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their ex ecutives the wrong sort of incentives the ruin of marconi may appear irrat ional when multibillionpound acquisitions are being declared worthless a fter only two years but executives with lucrative stock option plans whic h pay off if their gambles go right combined with golden goodbye and pensi on packages that are triggered if things go wrong may well consider it per fectly rational from their viewpoint to take much bigger risks than other shareholders or employees would consider acceptabletwo zero moreover sir christopher gent shareholders of vodafone will remember rec eived a controversial one zero m personal bonus last year for clinching the manne smann takeover a deal that requires one zero bn of writeoffstwo zero in normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rati onal but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window many i nvestors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly that is why many people subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of

be placed against a single parent static product bar prices when you change a price in the product bar and hit the or button the price stays it does not reset to the amount in product properties until you logout sorting you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on the title of the field for multiple sorts hold down your shift key parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified eg the product bar might before have said basis link parent and now would say stand alone parent detailed feature descriptions multiple children the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together in a long chain for example child product a can be linked to parent product b which is in turn linked to parent product c warning although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain system performance is degraded by large chains this is because when a customer attempts a transaction the database must lock each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request the database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks vertical chains multiple parents and children in one long link are much slower to process than flat chains one parent with many children large vertical chains should be avoided related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent for example child product a can have a basis link to parent product b at the same time child product c can have a syncopated basis link to the same parent product b parent b is the parent for both a syncopated basis link and a regular basis link static product bar prices the new version of enrononline provides for sticky product bar price and volume changes when you change a number on the product bar it does not reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you have logged out this makes it easier to update prices volumes spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the or buttons one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements with the old version of stack manager if the price delta was too small traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth this makes it harder for customers to transact with us each time they try a new price update moves the price resulting in an increased transaction failure rate entering an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer but larger price movements are necessary improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices a new field for offset to last trade this allows you to update the offset for products which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu sortingselecting the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old you can now choose any field heading type location reference period etc and sort by that item you can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key example if you select type and then location while holding the shift key you will see your products sorted first by product type and then within each product type by location in alphabetical order if you right click on the product menu you can choose from the same sort criteria plus you can select sort by web order which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website note however that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing when you select products you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always but now you can also hold down the ctrl key while making your selections this allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another parent products and fx products one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed the old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the product bar to the left of the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs the new version does not show the type of link this is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product some traders may notice that their products which have fx links are now identified with a stylised fx in the product list this is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the parent rather than managed individually assistance as always if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality please contact the two four hour help desk houston seven

the potential liabilities lurking in the companys financial structure enroll has used a web of offbalance sheet financing vehicles to fund its growing business and preserve its credit rating thereby

shell would want to make an acquisition while a securities and exchange commission investigation is pending as for enrons core franchise its energy marketing and trading business it could be easily argued that the most valuable asset there is enrons staff as a result it would help if deal were friendly because such a transaction could protect against the attrition sometimes associated with

thought that the directors would be somewhat typical of the professional board members that predominate at large companies busy people who wouldnt know a derivative if it walked into them and hit them along side the head with a twobyfour its just the opposite let me rip down some of these folks bios and you can be as puzzled as i am lets take them alphabetically robert belfer ran belco petroleum and comes from a sophisticated family of oil operatives he should be able to spot anything that even smacked of chicanery in the oil business from just his oldboy ties i know this family they are very smart and very wise to the ways of wall street main street and the oil patch norman blake is a gent i met years ago at usfg before he sold it at a huge profit this man has recently served as ceo of comdisco a leasing company that is not only comfortable with debt and financing it is wallowing in it blake has general electric training this man can smell things that are not so right from miles away where was he in all of this stuck in comdisco hell ronnie chan is a longtime kingpin in hong kong a place where financial originality is always on display chan certainly would have understood how unseemly all of these one seven partnerships would have appeared hes seen everything over in kong john duncan is an energy investment guy a director of eott energy and a seasoned pro who knows oil and gas financing and accounting again very sophisticated wendy gramm regulated derivatives she was the chairman of the cftc and a director of the chicago mercantile exchange how could she not have spotted this obvious conflict and probed what these partnerships entailed that was part of her old job robert jaedicke was a professor of accounting at stanford business school where he was also dean this guy wrote the book on this stuff and really should have seen it coming i am skipping ken lay the ceo charles lemaistre and john mendelsohn two execs from the university of texas md anderson cancer center cant be expected to catch this stuff and therefore gets a pass from me paulo ferraz pereira is a former president and chief executive officer of the state bank of rio de janeiro thats probably put him in more than his fair share of difficult financial situations how could he not raise a word about it frank savage serves as chairman of alliance capital management international perhaps the most sophisticated company in the world of money management i am sure savage never saw a situation as bad as enrons looking through his own companys portfolio of investments jeffrey skilling the man who resigned as ceo needs to be heard from we know that he is a director of the houston branch of the federal reserve bank of dallas a sinecure that slouches and undervigilant execs dont get hold what did he know and when did he know it john wakeham lord wakeham to everybody is perhaps the most financially sophisticated brit to serve in parliament he managed a large private practice as a chartered accountant hes big and powerful and smart herbert winokur is a longtime financial hand who also has run investment partnerships and used to serve as a director of penn central a place that saw more than its share of ups and downs and tricky financial situations in short this is the most sophisticated handson group of folks i have come across i cant believe they checked off on this stuff i have to believe they didnt know or if they knew of the partnerships i believe they had no idea what they were doing i want so badly to presume that these partnerships were simply set up to take down a lot of debt and not hurt enrons credit rating with the agencies not that thats such an ethical setup but at least it makes me think that the board might have been confused or not focused because it would have seemed unimportant as they might not have known how big and how extended the partnerships were still lets not fool ourselves this was a powerhouse fantastic upright board

vu circa one nine nine one thats what i keep thinking about i recall that time vividly bank of boston chase chemical citibank they all started rallying we bears would call each other and joke about it we would say that it was a ridiculous move that it should be shorted and shorted aggressively because there was no way that any of these banks would make it heck bank of boston was teetering on insolvency citibank was technically bankrupt already the jim grants of the world more powerful now than they were then because he didnt have as many years of being dead wrong but erudite under his belt would be alerting everyone to the absurdity of the common stocks of the banks rallying i would call the analysts and they wouldnt know anything either the ones who liked the banks all the way down who still liked them and who had no credibility at all the ones who hated them didnt want to get off the winning horses they didnt know that the race was over and that a new one had begun or to put it the brutal way that i now know was right no one with a brain was long any of these turns out of course that brains were one of those commodities that was wildly overvalued at the bottom what you had to do was check your skepticism and embrace optimism because at certain points in history optimists get it right thats how i feel about this market i think the time to be skeptical was before all of the damage occurred i think we will look back at this period and say the following the great bear market started in march two zero zero zero and was continuing to run rampant until sept one one the crisis that triggered a massive influx of liquidity and lower interest rates that turned things around most of the brains at the time were thinking that nothing really could change and that we were going to slide into a japanese recession or that no turn would ever come they were wrong just like they were in one nine nine one we get so caught up in the is cisco bottoming or is intel breaking out minutiae that we forget that the market has been pretty good for some time now pretty good since that crescendo selloff two months ago you would think that wed have converted more bears to bulls by now but like in one nine nine one it didnt happen until well into the turn dont confuse my optimism with some cold hard realities i think that for example xo communications is going to fail and when it does there will be the requisite selloff and setbacks to tech i think that mcleod is going to fail and we will see the same there are a ton of companies that wont get through this period just like there were a ton of banks and savings and loans that failed long after the turn came in one nine nine one and i reserve the right to hate individual stocks i cant get my arms around how ford comes back i dont understand the enron fiasco at all i am not even sure that qwest can staunch the bleeding but that doesnt make me bearish understand that i am strictly a pavlovian creature had i not lived through the giant financial short squeezes of late one nine nine zero and early one nine nine one had i not personally been bought in on a halfdozen banks i was shorting and had i not later on seen those banks get big bids from superregionals not long after i too would be suspicious and want to bet against the market i cant though because my capacity for loss remembrance is so much greater than my ability to remember my wins that the pattern stays in my head like a hot stove that i dont want to get burned by again believe me i am a coldblooded individual about these things if i thought the short side was the right side here i would be all over it we have had a huge bounce off the bottom there would be nothing unpatriotic about saying get out now but i dont think thats right i think this markets going to keep working here if it doesnt people will email me and harangue me and make fun of me and i will say cest la vie i took a stand it was wrong taking stands however is

of negotiated rate deals the orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that tennessee anr and columbia had done these provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates but ferc has decided that there is significant potential for undue discrimination and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative thus anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly raterelated will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny ferc adds another layer to policy on negotiatedrate authority acting on a series of contractspecific cases ferc last week sharpened its policy on what is and is not allowed under negotiated rates in further defining its policy the commission continued to lean heavily on the linchpin of negotiatedrate authority that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under costbased recourse rates during discussion of the orders chairman pat wood iii said it was important to keep in mind as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side that all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines last weeks proclamation should be considered a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend he asserted in representative language the commission said it wants to ensure that parties are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk of such unequal treatment ferc declared that a key factor in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an appropriate material deviation from a pipelines filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide adequate alternatives to other shippers in cases involving rates negotiated by anr pipeline co gtzero one two five rpnine nine three zero one tennessee gas pipeline co rpnine six three one two et al and columbia gas transmission corp cpzero one seven zero the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines generally available tariffs the provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals while the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiatedrate package we have reconsidered that holding because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates it said in the tennessee order where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity recourse service provides an adequate alternative the commission observed however if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute since recourse service would not include any such provision a shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk giving it an advantage over recourserate shippers the commission pointed out a shippers right to reduce or terminate its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges ferc said adding that such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated in a fair manner ferc reasoned once approved the tariff language will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers commissioner linda breathitt applauded the policy shift characterizing it as a muchneeded shot in the arm for a program that had become muddled through a tortured line of cases fercs definitions of allowable contracting practices were obscured breathitt said in welcoming the new commonsense approach the tug of war that parties have engaged in over the past few years really hasnt served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service are available to all shippers she said,09:16:21,No

information please treat with discretion executive summary ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives politically bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis from an economic perspective he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan most notably its exclusion of outofstate generators june one st kill clause for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade expected two zero billion power bill this summereconomic crisis would force deeper administration involvement qf bid for advance payments from pge likely to fail in bankruptcy court new generation delays probable because of stateqf squabbling consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal one ferc fallout the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action but is not rather it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame once they are politically inoculated the administration can begin to look at regional solutions moreover the administration has already made explicit and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan two something less than effective price caps from daviss point of view the ferc plan has four major flaws the order applies only to california not to the rest of the west noncalifornia generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california as the order is written it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage two emergency and does not require any collusion even when the price caps kick in they are based on the costplus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap the generators can also charge above the cap provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc three proposal kill clause adds to the political dilemma for davis the ferc proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be withdrawn unless californias iso agrees by june one st to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control if davis doesnt sign on to the regional grid by june one st then he will have to live with june two nd headlines blaming him for letting the bush price caps plan collapse four growing fiscal risk in california sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as two zero billion on power this summer this is more than the combined enterprise value of pge and sce these sources believe that because of the severity of the situation the ferc andor the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about nine zero days one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for longterm power deals the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture the countrys largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months five qfs to seek advance payment from pge meanwhile on the bankruptcy front the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pges accounts since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas it appears very unlikely that the qfs request will be granted if the qfs do not receive advance payment it is likely that most of the four zero zero zero mw of gasfired qf capacity will remain offline six delays likely in new qf generation the qf deals made with the state for longterm contracts are being continually renegotiated which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated seven consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan the analysis was done by a utilities analyst rather than a lawyer though it appears to raise a number of good legal points for example one of the elements of the mou is a nonbypassable charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid this is effectively a tax since there is no exchange of value for money which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds rather than revenue bonds according to the constitution the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company for this and other reasons even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout which remains unlikely the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge eight governor hurt by continued failure to disclose longterm power contracts the issue of the governors failure to disclose the details of the longterm power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged creating an even further delay,09:25:00,"Yes,

units in the original production schedules given the timely authority to proceed in that new direction if the units are built according to the new redesigned parameters abb would have to make the necessary material and performance changes to get to enrons desired characteristics especially for the impedance change and the necessity to perform in a higher ambient temperature overall this redesign will require a price adder to each of the two transformers of four nine five zero zero zero zero each key factors in this cost adder would be the engineering redesign effort the additional radiators required and the use of high delivery fans the overall footprint dimensions and guaranteed performance of the transformer also must be adjusted to meet the new parameters requested as

of negotiated rate deals the orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that tennessee anr and columbia had done these provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates but ferc has decided that there is significant potential for undue discrimination and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative thus anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly raterelated will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny ferc adds another layer to policy on negotiatedrate authority acting on a series of contractspecific cases ferc last week sharpened its policy on what is and is not allowed under negotiated rates in further defining its policy the commission continued to lean heavily on the linchpin of negotiatedrate authority that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under costbased recourse rates during discussion of the orders chairman pat wood iii said it was important to keep in mind as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side that all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines last weeks proclamation should be considered a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend he asserted in representative language the commission said it wants to ensure that parties are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk of such unequal treatment ferc declared that a key factor in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an appropriate material deviation from a pipelines filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide adequate alternatives to other shippers in cases involving rates negotiated by anr pipeline co gtzero one two five rpnine nine three zero one tennessee gas pipeline co rpnine six three one two et al and columbia gas transmission corp cpzero one seven zero the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines generally available tariffs the provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals while the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiatedrate package we have reconsidered that holding because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates it said in the tennessee order where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity recourse service provides an adequate alternative the commission observed however if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute since recourse service would not include any such provision a shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk giving it an advantage over recourserate shippers the commission pointed out a shippers right to reduce or terminate its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges ferc said adding that such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated in a fair manner ferc reasoned once approved the tariff language will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers commissioner linda breathitt applauded the policy shift characterizing it as a muchneeded shot in the arm for a program that had become muddled through a tortured line of cases fercs definitions of allowable contracting practices were obscured breathitt said in welcoming the new commonsense approach the tug of war that parties have engaged in over the past few years really hasnt served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service are available to all shippers she said,09:16:21,No

diego uniontribune one two one two zero zero colombias medellin utility appeals isagen ruling paper says bloomberg one two one two zero zero energy costs rocket handing consumers biggest shock yet by craig d rose uniontribune staff writer december one two two zero zero zero power prices in california keep hitting new heights with prices in the states main electricity market rising today to nearly nine zero zero per megawatt hour the rise continues a stunning ascent from a price of about five zero per megawatt hour as recently as last spring in retail terms todays prices if sustained for a month would result in an average residential power bill of more than four five zero san diego ratepayers are temporarily shielded from such high bills by a ratedeferral plan in effect at least until two zero zero two the latest prices represent a more than tripling in posted prices on the california power exchange since friday when the operator of the state power grid removed a statemandated price cap of two five zero the latest escalation which comes despite improvements yesterday in state power supplies is deepening the sense of crisis among state officials consumer advocates and utility companies nonetheless a spokesman for gov gray davis who met yesterday with top energy advisers in los angeles said it was unlikely there would be action to address the crisis at the state level until after federal regulators release their plan for california the federal energy regulatory commission is scheduled to issue a final order regarding californias market at its meeting tomorrow but yesterday the commission made plans for a second meeting friday to deal with the states problems and did not clarify at which session it would issue the california order davis and others in the state have been critical of fercs refusal to halt what they describe as a devastating rise in power prices here or to order refunds for payments made by consumers over the past summer the governor also has been severely critical of the california independent system operators decision to lift the state price cap last week the iso manages most of the states power supply privately most at the state level remain skeptical that federal action will ease the crisis saying it will be up to california to fix the problem last friday ferc quickly approved the isos plan to end the price cap increasingly state officials and consumer activists are talking about stateowned power systems utility takeovers and a likely initiative seeking to overturn deregulation sdge and others also emphasize the need for a price cap for the western region of the united states in order to prevent suppliers from migrating to the highest prices and driving prices upward everywhere the new highs in electricity prices came even as the iso said the states supplies had improved with the startup of production from a formerly closed nuclear power plant unit the apparent contradiction between the increase in available power and the continued price escalation was blamed on a number of factors high prices for natural gas which fuels power plants continued to drive up the cost of generating electricity cold conditions in the midwest helped push natural gas prices to record highs yesterday allegations also persist that energy companies have manipulated the market consumers union and other advocacy groups say deregulating electricity prices has proven to be a costly error for california consumers at the same time the controversial removal of price caps in california is allowing prices to rise to levels approaching those in other western states weve now had three days of the hebert experiment said state sen steve peace del cajon peace was referring to curt hebert a ferc commissioner who opposes price caps for wholesale electricity peace who played a prime role in californias deregulation legislation likened the runup in electricity prices to the oil embargo of the one nine seven zero s and warned that it could devastate the economy someone from former gov pete wilsons administration told me somebody in the energy business decided its time for a depression said peace who has also been critical of fercs failure to rein in prices this is not about electricity its about the economy in a letter to ferc yesterday peace repeated earlier calls for a federal order returning the state to regulated power prices based on the cost of production market watchers said little could help the state over the next few days except mother nature the prices will remain at these levels unless you get a warming trend said alex galatic of strategic energy a pittsburghbased energy company with offices in carlsbad market speculators appear to be betting against a break in price any time soon for example electricity is selling for eight zero zero per megawatt hour in the pacific northwest for delivery in january galatic said i see no break in the pricing agreed arthur odonnell editor of california energy markets a publication based in san francisco a spokesman for enron corp the largest electricity trader in the united states said the raising of prices in california had improved supplies available to the state and he added that there was another positive aspect to the higher commodity prices you are starting to see some demand response said mark palmer the enron spokesman referring to cutbacks in power use as prices soar some companies are shutting down because it makes more sense to sell their gas rather than using it as fuel to continue their manufacturing operations thats not an option for the states utility companies which continue to report growing losses from buying electricity at higher costs than they can collect from their customers they have covered the shortfall by borrowing money dow jones newswires reported that pacific gas electric was only weeks away from being unable to cover its power costs if prices continue at recent levels a spokesman for the bay area utilitys parent company declined to comment directly on the report its up to the decision of creditors to make that call said greg pruett vice president of communications for pge we have already borrowed two six billion to cover undercollections that have totaled four six billion it cant continue forever colombias medellin utility appeals isagen ruling paper says one two one two zero

Probe Eliminated from Barton CA Bill,ngis daily gas price index published april two five two zero zero one ferc price probe eliminated from barton ca bill a proposal calling on ferc to conduct a formal investigation into wholesale power rates in western markets has been stripped out of the latest discussion draft of emergency legislation that was released tuesday by chairman joe barton rtx of the house energy and air quality subcommittee instead of proposing that the commission undertake a section two zero six probe to determine if prices are just and reasonable which could lead eventually to price controls bartons latest draft provides a mix of demandmanagement incentives environmental waivers proposals to eliminate or reduce transmission constraints energy conservation measures and emergency preparedness initiatives to mitigate ballooning wholesale electricity and natural gas prices in ailing markets in california and other western states the decision to peel out the provision on the ferc price investigation did not come as a major surprise given the republicans unyielding opposition to any federal intervention in wholesale power prices however this move could make it all the more difficult to report a bill out of the subcommittee and the full house energy and commerce committee in light of democratic members support for price caps andor costbased rates bartons emergency legislation which seeks to provide supply and price relief in the west by this summer isnt expected to be formally introduced in the house until later this week were shooting for sometime before the subcommittee hearing on the bill which is scheduled for next tuesday said barton spokeswoman samantha jordan barton is expected to hold only one hearing on his legislation to be named the electricity emergency act and then quickly proceed to markup significantly the draft measure also stripped out a section that would have amended the federal power act fpa to give ferc limited authority over the siting of transmission facilities barton and subcommittee members were considering this move in an earlier discussion draft believing that such authority would help to hasten the construction of muchneeded transmission capacity several members of the commission also supported a move in this direction in what was seen a big blow for natural gas a section that would have required utilities to interconnect to distributed generation facilities has been taken out too im not jumping for joy im not upset to tell you the truth theres not much to comment on gas with distributed generation removed said a gas industry lobbyist i think that distributed generation will come back in a larger energy bill he noted but im still unsure how far it the barton bill will get in congress tuesdays discussion draft added a couple of new provisions foremost it orders ferc to establish a program for consumers within the one three state western systems coordinating council wscc to resell at market prices the electricity that they dont consume but otherwise are entitled to use under contract or applicable regulation this provision is designed to give consumers a financial incentive to conserve power during peak demand the consumer could resell the unused electricity to either their utility or to a thirdparty purchaser in cases of thirdparty sales the local utility would credit the third party for the amount of power purchased either way the local utility would receive the same amount of revenue that it would have received if the consumer had not opted to reduce consumption the consumer would benefit from conserving electricity and the resulting demand reduction would have a cooling effect on prices by bringing demand back into balance with supply according to a summary of the discussion draft the program would expire in october two zero zero three another new provision directs the energy secretary to establish electric power transmission corridors across federal lands after conducting a study of the need for transmission expansion and determining that siting of transmission facilities on federal land is necessary and appropriate the summary said barton also has added a section addressing the sale of transmission assets to the state of california in the event california acquires the transmission lines of a public utility such as southern california edison the draft proposes that the state be made subject to the same jurisdiction at ferc as had the public utility it further calls on the energy secretary to conduct an energy conservation educational campaign through the media to promote conservation in certain geographic regions where demand for electricity is expected to exceed available supplies in the near term other provisions in the discussion draft which were in the earlier draft would give state governors the opportunity to ask the environmental protection agency epa for temporary waivers of certain nox emission requirements for newly constructed power plants for a period of two years create a limited emergency provision for governors to submit plans to the epa to allow natural gasfired power plants and onsite generators to exceed certain nox limitations during power emergencies equivalent to the stage iii alerts in california and when blackouts are imminent allow the energy secretary if requested by a governor to authorize any federal facility to generate electricity for selfconsumption or for sales to the state so long as compensation is assured by the purchasers or by the state authorize the administrator of the bonneville power administration to require hydroelectric facilities that provide power to the bpa to step up their electric generation output if asked to do so by the governors of the pacific northwest states washington oregon idaho and montana the bill also would give hydroelectric licensees greater latitude to modify the terms andor conditions in their fercapproved licenses to respond to power emergencies when declared by a state governor authorize the administrator of the western area power administration system wapa to expand its transmission system to eliminate the constraint on path one five the bill would set aside up to two two zero million for this project all expansion costs would be recovered by wapa through transmission fees or from the sale of ownership interests in transmission facilities direct the energy secretary in coordination with the federal emergency management agency fema to initiate emergency planning in states that are likely to face electricity shortages direct ferc to establish a clearinghouse system for those who would want to auction electric energy to which they have contractual rights allow qualifying facility qf generators to sell power to third parties when a utility is unable to pay under a purchase power agreement prohibit the energy secretary ferc any other officer or agency of the federal government and the courts from ordering sellers to provide electricity or natural gas unless there is a guarantee that as determined by the commission is sufficient to ensure that the seller will be paid the full purchase price when due allow california nevada oregon and washington to adjust their standard time if they find it can help to alleviate an electricity crisis direct the energy secretary and ferc to do a joint study of transmission congestion and develop a plan to relieve constraints and report to congress within six months of the legislations enactment and direct a state governor to request an emergency reduction in energy consumption within that state lastly barton is considering including in the bill a provision that would require full participation in a westernwide regional transmission organization rto if agreed to by at least one zero of one three governors within the wscc all federal facilities would be directed to participate in the rto as would municipallyowned utilities and cooperatives owning or operating transmission facilities within the region the requirement to participate would sunset three years after the rto is

in response to pge decision to file for bankruptcy attorney general bill lockyer issues statement in response to pge decision to file for bankruptcy sacramento attorney general bill locker today released the following statement regarding pacific gas electrics decision to file for bankruptcy the uncontrolled increase in electricity prices by generators and marketers has claimed another victim with the bankruptcy of one of californias oldest businesses while this is a significant and unwelcome development our team of bankruptcy litigators has been preparing for several months to defend california taxpayers in the event of a utility bankruptcy this morning i spoke with a pge executive and he personally assured me that the utility will honor its legal obligation to pay the state for its purchase of energy and to repay its renewable energy suppliercreditors qualified facilities i am prepared to enforce those assurances in the courts to the extent necessary over the last several months our state attorneys have fought hard in the courts to ensure that outofstate generators continue to deliver adequate electricity and natural gas supplies to californians in spite of the precarious financial condition of the states two major utilities the health and safety of californians and the future of our economy require that our state not be left holding the bag for greedy business decisions of generators marketers and utilities justice requires that those who have reaped unconscionable profits at the expense of californians must pay back what they owe i will use all the considerable resources of the law to help our policymakers keep the lights on and the bills affordable for every california home and business to recover california tax and ratepayer dollars that have been illegally or unfairly taken and to punish wrongdoers award to informants it is possible that one or more members of the public can help with information and if so the financial reward to such a person or persons could be enormous my office is conducting an aggressive investigation into whether energy providers have violated any laws over the last four years state and local government agencies have spent billions of dollars in state and local taxpayer money to purchase electricity and natural gas under california false claims law any person or corporation who obtains state taxpayer money by fraud or illegal acts is liable for financial penalties that can be as high as three times the actual losses and anyone who provides information leading to the successful prosecution of a false claim action may be entitled to a percentage share in that award since billions of state dollars may be recovered the award to an informant could potentially range from five zero million to the hundreds of millions of dollars i am asking any member of the public with personal knowledge of any wrongful act which may have resulted in reduction in the california supplies or increase in the price of natural gas or electricity to contact my office immediately by calling one eight zero zero nine five two five two two five win ca or nine one six three two two three three six zero local or

denver qb brian griese made my downgrade list in the upgrades downgrade article according to john clayton of espn grieses shoulder injury is a separation of the ac joint in his right clavicle he took a pain killing shot and finished the game unfortunately his status for this weeks game against san diego is in doubt at this point coach mike shanahan is saying it will be a couple of days before they decide what theyre doing ive copied the entire story below if youd like more details sounds like this victory could be one of those career turning point games for him griese describing how he knew he was about to get slammed in the pocket because he could hear the crowd hold its breath is classic ill keep an eye on it for you as this shakes out joe from the article httpespngocomnflnewstwo zero zero zero one one one four eight seven six eight nine eight html denver brian griese had a secret mike shanahan knew because he was the head coach griese knew because he had the pain piercing in the middle of his right shoulder his teammates didnt know what went on behind closed doors in mondays dramatic two seven two four broncos victory over the raiders at mile high stadium all his teammates knew was that he had injured his right shoulder on an illadvised run out of bounds minutes into the first quarter griese retreated to the locker room with a trainer but wasnt missed the raiders had an one one play fieldgoal drive that lasted six minutes teammates saw griese trot back to the field warm up and miss only five plays they didnt hear that griese had separated his right clavicle and ac joint and needed a paindeadening shot to finish the final three quarters this is not a game i wanted to miss and i was going to do anything possible to get in the game and help my team win griese said i was going to do it it was just the will to play and the will to win and i wasnt going to come out an hour after the game broncos players were surprised that the man who ran their huddle had a busted wing his performance was john elwaylike for courage but it also leaves the broncos uncertain if they will have griese available as a starting quarterback for sundays game against the san diego chargers we wont know for a couple of days the exact extent of the injury but hes such a competitor shanahan said hes been like that since hes been here he wants to play and sometimes you have to be cautious to make sure he doesnt further hurt himself thats the kind of guy he is rod smith is among the many broncos who have grown to love this guy last year was different in the preseason it was supposed to be bubby bristers team but shanahan named griese the starter veterans didnt feel totally comfortable with him griese didnt feel comfortable bossing around a group of players who didnt take to him brians the one to lead us smith said i think it would have hurt him more just sitting there and watching rather than being out there playing with the shoulder the way it was whatever he does he doesnt surprise me hes the best quarterback in the nfl i know the raiders think rich gannon is we think brian is griese told his offensive players that he didnt have too much zip on the ball they accepted it as just humility i wasnt throwing the ball as well i have been griese said some of the balls just died at that point it was just your will to play your will to win i wasnt coming out of the game griese was two two ofthree two for two two one yards with a separated shoulder hed throw passes and hear as well as feel his shoulder popping in and out i knew there was something wrong with it but they assured me that i couldnt do any further damage griese said it was just whether i could handle the pain being injured didnt make griese shy away from contact several times he took shots from raiders defenders that bounced him to the frozen mile high stadium grass once cornerback eric allen charged untouched from the blindside griese ducked as allen hit him shoulder high believe it or not the reason i kind of ducked when he came in is that i heard the crowd and the crowd held their breath and i could hear that griese said i said to myself well somebody must be ready to hit me talk about homefield advantage griese has never had an injury like this he has played two seasons with a torn labrum problem in his shoulder that requires surgery but this was much more painful griese remembered a pass to rod smith along the sideline that was a big play he had to make just an armthrough pass it was agonizing he threw a skinny post to ed mccaffrey that left mccaffrey vulnerable to a hit on the chin i apologized to him for that because the ball kind of floated on me and i didnt have any zip on the ball griese said griese said the feeling of his shoulder popping in and out was different we knew it was something that was hurting him we knew he was banged up fullback howard griffith said thats how it is when youve got a job to do still the story told after the game amazed

announced that they have launched an electronic business transaction ebt hub that will provide centralized electronic data management and transaction services to local distribution companies ldcs and energy retailers in ontario called ebt express the exchange will become operational when ontarios new competitive electricity market opens next spring excelergy exactzero one v developed by energy software solutions company excelergy corporation will provide the technology infrastructure for ebt express analysis this is a significant development as ebt express represents the first hub in canada for retail energy transactions the site will serve as the central clearinghouse for immediate communication of customer data among hundreds of ldcs and energy retailers in ontario and possiblytwo zero throughout canada i spoke yesterday afternoon with george caraghiaur exelergys vice president canada about ebt express caraghiaur believes that the site will provide the essential technology for opening ontarios electrici ty market in an efficient manner that is no small undertaking as there are an expected three zero zero players that will need to communicate with each other in ontario once competition begins deregulation is happening in canada on a provincebyprovince basis much like it is happening statebystate in the us thus far only ontario and alberta have set dates when electric customers will be able to select a new energy supplier ontario is scheduled to become competitive next spring and presently is the only region in which ebt express will betwo zero operational alberta uses a pointtopoint transaction process which represents a very complex model caraghiaur believes that the value of ebt express will be clearly seen and there will be many opportunities for the hub in alberta and elsewhere the ontario energy board oeb which is the equivalent of a state puc mandated the use of electronic business transactions ebts the ebts work as follows once a customer selects a new energy supplier the energy suppl ier and the local distribution company ldc must continue to share information about that customer this proprietary data shared strictly on a onetoone basis between the energy supplier and the ldc only will include billing usage and payment information essentially an ldc will read the meter and send usage information to the energy supplier who will calculate its portion of a customers bill and in turn send this data back to the ldc which will submit the customer bill this represents a common way for billi ng in ontario although there are other options including consolidated billing that originates from the energy supplier and split billing coming from both the ldc and energy supplier no customer information will be exchanged until competition officially begins in ontario which now appears to be in the spring of two zero zero one although the technology infrastructure supplied by excelergy is already in place in response to the oebs mandate toronto hydro corp and ontario power generationzero one the largest players in electricity distribution and generatio n in ontariozero one became equity partners in the seven seven million joint venture to create ebt express all customer data will be contained within ebt express which is supported by the exact technology excelergy exact is a software solution that translates validates manages and delivers data exchanged among users the functionality of exact has been used in several us state s including pennsylvania and new jersey in fact exact was introduced to gas and electricity retailers in the united states in one nine nine nine as a component of excelergy abpzero one v a billing and customer information solution alleghen y energy supply a subsidiary of allegheny energy was one us utility that i know of that used the excelergy technology caraghiaur contends that ebt express will play an important role in enhanci ng the competitive market in ontario there are presently three seven licensed retaile rs in ontario one five pending retailers and two four six ldcs caraghiaur told me you can imagine the cloud of communication pathways that would occur between all these players without a centralized hub such as ebt express the numbe r of ldcs seemed awfully high to me but caraghiaur explained that in ontario many ldcs serve only a small number of customers often one zero zero customers or less this should change as consolidation reduces the number of ldcs in ontario but when compared to the united states ontario still will have a comparatively high number of distribution companies caraghiaur cited pennsylvania as an example of a market that has tried to assimilate communication among many market participants pennsylvania along with most other us states still uses electronic data interchange edi as its standard wherein every ldc has a slightly differenttwo zero interpretation of data that is shared through the edi this can often cause communication inconsistencies and retailers may have a difficult time in getting ready for deregulation ebt express will be in the position to enforce standards says caraghiaur the use of xml in particular will enhance communication between market participants in fact xml extensible market language is the cornerstone of exact as it constructs a standardized language so that data can be exchanged but still understood by different applications caraghiaur claims that excelerg y is on the forefront of xml technology which was expressly stipulated in the ebt standards developed by the advisory committee to the ontario energy board xml is a common language used on the internet that makes it easier and more costeffective for buyers and sellers to exchange data between applications and data sources that otherwise might have been incompatible in addition excelergys exact software is objectoriented allowing for easy and rapid change from one program to another clearinghouse exchanges are definitely a trend in the energy industry whereas states that previously deregulated such as california andtwo zero pennsylvania did not use a centralized clearinghouse for customer information states and provinces now formulating their restructuring plans often mandate them for instance excelergys competitor logica has a market data clearinghouse built for the midwest market also the ercotiso has teamed with andersen consulting on a similar market data clearinghouse for the texas unbundling scheduled for pilot in the summer of two zero zero one and full market opening in januar y two zero zero two one concern that market participants may have is the sharing of customer data through ebt express especially when it is backed by potentialtwo zero competitors in the ontario market such as toronto hydro and ontario power caraghiaur responded to this by saying that the oeb mandated the exchange of customer information through an ebt structure however market participants are not mandated to participate in ebt express they could opt to still exchang e information on a pointtopoint basis although caraghiaur believes that ebt express offers a much more efficient forum for the transfer of customer data in addition caraghiaur reiterated that no proprietary or competitive information would be accessible between any parties other than the ldc and energy supplier involved in the exchange interestingly toronto hydro and ontario power may be competitors when the ontario market opens next year toronto hydro corp owns torontotwo zero hydroelectric system limited a regulated electricity distribution system and toronto hydro energy services a competitive energy service company ontario power generation is an electricity generating company so toronto hydro and ontar io power will be competing on the retail level to acquire energy supply contra cts with lucrative customers and rumor has it that venerable retail giant sears is also taking a look into becoming an energy retailer in canada next year as canada continues to deregulate and attract energy suppliers excelergy anticipates that the ebt express could serve a national market three dthree dthree dthree dthree dthree dthree

be recieving bids for the trading arm of enron i have heard that is the strongest part of the company i guess you know which is best to raise capital for the company selling the trading business or holding on to it a money making arm to gain a stronger future position good luck and may god be with your choices dear ken i am very sad to see what has happened to such a big icon in houston i am very sorry to see you struggle through this and try to remain at a high level i am very pleased to see you chose to stay with the company and work at what i hope is its new birth and positive rise in society and business community i had a chance to meet with you a little over a year ago at a charity function while i am no expert in the energy business and im but a college student at the present time i would like to share a view from the other side of the inner loop youre used to before i met you everyone i spoke with had nothing but wonderful things to say about you and what a genius you are after the news came out about the misfortune of enron some of those same people started bad mouthing some of the same people they praised it made me sick and made me think very little of those individuals i was concerned because i could not believe that you would intentionally and knowingly do something that would jeopardize the very company you helped build the day i saw you make the decision to not leave or step down as ceo i knew then that you must not have been directly involved in the coverup done by your previous coo and a couple of other top executives you had entrusted those few peo ple one of which you had recently hired all quit just before the news came out about enron bookkeeping i feel safe in saying you must have been misadvised by those few people or you did not know what they were doing behind your back it is obvious they were not working for enron like you but rather at enron to try to steal as much money and benefits they could and then head for the hills which is what they did the mere act of having several top executives quit working at enron after a short stay at the company and then cashing out on their holdings tells me it was intentional and i consider them thieves it would be a different story had they stayed like you and really cared about the company and what it represents and does for society as a whole i feel very sorry for those investors and employees who have been devastated by what has happened but it makes me very angry to hear people and writers casting stones on you and a company that has done so much over the past several years for so many enron has funded more charity events and backed more functions and elections than most now when the tide has turned and due to a few greedy top executive decisions enron is in the position of needing help everyone is out for blood and looking to end a company that still represent the same work it did before but whose value has decreased because of word of mouth and the stupid greed of your previous employees some people i have talked with say enron is finished and is only a matter of time before it is gone that makes me angry too from what i see you have not given up on the company nor have you abandoned ship that tells me you may be trying to rebuild the company and its reputation that would be the greatest thing to do and show those who are out for enrons demise and who can do nothing but bad mouth just what youre really made of and put them in their place i have been reading nothing but negative articles about the company i feel like it is not the company because that would mean every single employee would be to blame rather the writers should focus on the few individuals who cashed out and split i would hope you could remember back four or five years ago when the company was really thriving and doing well i hope you can remember the good things about the company and the fact that it can still and does make money from its businesses it can turn around if you want it to i would hope you can make the trading business and other companies held by enron what it once was without having to sell off too many of the future profitable ones and make use of the two beautiful buildings now towering over houstons skyline i call those houstons twin towers other large companies in the past have turned around after similar set backs as horrible as this with enron your turn around would be record setting i heard about others like the teachers retirement fund making noise about wanting to take enron to court because they invested millions that is stupid because it is their choice to invest and their risk to take especially making it after the news broke about the company sure they trusted that dynegy would merge so perhaps their frustration should be aimed at dynegy or perhaps use their collective educated minds together to help find a way to turn enron around and make their investment purposeful rather than throwing stones i think dynegy is a wonderful company as well but it was mean for them to come out and say yes they would merge and then not i realize its all business and people like to make money but its another thing to flat steal and lie like your executives you trusted did rather than profit from hard work and honesty i personally know of many large corporations and politicians who have things to hide that would cause problems like yours your company is not alone which is why i am so angry with others throwing stones at you and enron this would not happen if there werent executives in corporate industries like the ones you entrusted your company to who try to take rather than give and earn from it perhaps many should learn from colleen barrett coo of southwest airlines do you know that they are the only airlines to refuse federal aid recently and they are doing better then most airlines good luck and thank you for hanging in there and making me believe there are still some good

employee was expressing her distorted views to the press on why generating companies should not abide by annex v she was not speaking on behalf of asmae however she was probably reflecting asmae view i did not mean to shoot the messenger but i could not refrain myself from expressing an opposite opinion there are two problems in patricias view one she is not supposed to express any views on contracts mae should only settle contracts but never attempt to arbitrate or solve bilateral contract disputes the lack of clarity on this point is the sole responsible for maes frustrated attempt to solve the angra ii furnas conflict in the last six months informativo regulatrio four explores the issue in more detail two she was dead wrong quite nave arguments a few arguments why gs should indeed abide by annex v we may use externally as you see fit one gs were forced to sign initial contracts so what it is a regulated contract by nature as so many others such as cust cusd cct ccd does it mean that parties signing those other agreements should not abide by their clauses two gs and ds did not have chance to negotiate terms and conditions so what i asked patricia why should any agent sign the market agreement without any chance to negotiate its terms it is by definition an adhesion contract does it mean that agents should not abide by the mae agreement provisions guess what the answer was none three some gs did not sign annex v eg furnas which apparently disobeyed annels instructions as per law nine six four eight nine eight this is serious that means that in addition to not be bound by contract those gs do not want to abide by law no response four some companies do not have annex v so what discussion is about annex v those companies should follow specific provisions on their supply contracts six ttariff energy price was not subject to negotiation as part of the initial contracts therefore they were not able to price the risk represented by annex v so what many contracts have regulated prices all use of system contracts have regulated prices furthermore the privatized generators had chance to price the annex v risk why giving them a windfall now since it is a zero sum game a windfall for generators is tantamount to a loss to distributors seven annex v was not designed to deal with rationing it was designed to mitigate hydrological risks due to central dispatch wrong erm mecanismo de realocao de energia was the mechanism put in place to deal with risks deriving from a central dispatch in a hyper tight pool operation annex v was indeed designed to deal with rationing it is called dry period relief clause it was proposed by the generators and approved by annel the spot price is a proxy for the depth of rationing one should not evoke rationing i think it is advisable to have a strong legal opinion on how annex v is bullet proof in the meantime let me share my views there is very limited room for negotiation whatsoever on annex v and on the ridiculous proposal made by generators that merchant plants should collect part in cash and part of their sales in junk bonds we should make this clear at the outset we should make minister patente realize that mario arces proposal is nonsense changing established contracts or setting caps on spot prices is a bad precedent no bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known risks a cap on spot is equivalent to what the central bank did for makra and fontecindam and became a public scandal if we do want to create a market we need to have responsible contracting irresponsible contracting should not be forgiven if we do it we will create a bad precedent and a poor environment for contracting we have to show minister parente that irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates no caps on spot irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity breaching contracts will create an uncertain environment for new ppas crisis will get worse and worse generators should have the burden of proof in the meantime annex v is effective and should be enforceable regarding california case as mentioned by mario arce it is a totally different situation in california dcs were not allowed to contract in brazil they were strongly encouraged generators who signed annex v could also have hedged their residual risks on annex vthey did not they acted irresponsibly they secondguessed regulations they did not help in expanding capacity they knew goverment will bail them out and revoke annex v the argument no one should lose no one should gain during rationing is inconsistent with market signals some one has to lose some one has to gain by definition and hopefully someone has to go bankrupt this will be a great lesson people will start taking market signals more seriously otherwise there will never be expansion and there will never be a market we have to be as transparent as possible finally i suggest enron to write a position paper on our own view on annex v and caps on spot and deliver it to minister parente early this week i volunteer to prepare a first draft if you guys agree it is a good idea lm,01:16:00,"Yes
