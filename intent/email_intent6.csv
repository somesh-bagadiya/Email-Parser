pstwo and ppd we did not get to show pi they all bought in that this was a sophisticated sourcing tool that it followed their processes and would help streamline their operation only negatives we heard was that the one m price tag was a show stopper and that they were trying to minimize rfqs and focus on release against agreements with two zero zero zero revs at over one zero zero b and a spend to match that their roi would be tremendous shirley jo said that her primary use of this system would be for any purchase over five zero k which requires three bids she does not feel that she has enough of these events to justify implementation in her ets group their current processes are basically pen paper phone and fax they do use rfq templates and excel spreadsheets they also model total cost of ownership evaluating the total lifecycle of materials they are using their homegrown auction platform dealbench and were trying to compare this against our system their transaction fees for using the dealbench system are minor so our pricing looks high but that would be comparing apples against oranges i will address this in the cover letter on the pilot proposal we will send questions that came up included what is the difference between maverick spend in procurement vs sourcing ian responded perfect reduces maverick spend during the sourcing cycle by standardizing company best practices and providing visibilityaccountability of vendor selection criteria how does the optimization calculation work ian gave basic explanation of input variables and rankingscoring dont feel we need to elaborate on this at this point possibly in future can we utilize a handson demo to play with the system we suggested a pilot but also said that it might be possible to work something out over webex just to test drive a little more before moving into a pilot we agreed that the next step is for us to send a pilot proposal and they will get together either friday or sometime next week to review the proposal discuss their opinions and determine the next step i sent the pilot proposal and cover letter out today by email after final approval by ian i will followup on monday to find out

blast of arctic air and now they are saying we will get some cooler air but not of the arctic variety said one northwest utility trader the revised forecasts also helped to lower balanceofthemonth contract costs at all of the major western hubs i was shocked that the dailies and the balance traded lower today we were expecting at least a little upside after yesterdays session said one surprised

many on tuesday regional forecasts were revised to reflect the anticipated arrival of arctic air which pushed the dailies higher wednesday brought about another forecast revision this time in the opposite direction while longerterm forecasts continued to call for belownormal temperatures for much of the region the extent of the cooling was not expected to be as severe as previously anticipated flow forecasts for chief joseph were revised slightly lower on wednesday coming in at seven five kcfs through friday six five kcfs saturday five five kcfs sunday nine zero kcfs monday and eight five kcfs next tuesday and wednesday the lower flows partly reflected the return of cooler temperatures which have curtailed recent snowmelt reducing side flows in turn on the topic of water the northwest

leads one to believe the problems are solely the result of restructuring efforts however some areas that have deregulated dont regret the decision last week pennsylvania gov tom ridge said that electric competition will save consumers in his state three billion by two zero zero one and increase productivity employment and personal income by two zero zero four his comments came as a response to a report recently issued by the state government the report prepared by the state department of revenue to measure the impact of restructuring on state finances said that forecast reductions in retail electricity prices will improve the states economy in several ways by two zero zero four as a direct result of electric competition the report says the real gross state product will be one nine

manufacturing jobs nearly seven zero zero zero retailsector jobs more than five zero zero zero construction jobs nearly two seven zero zero transportation and public utility jobs and more than one two

four zero zero persons or zero four as workers move to the state pennsylvanias national leadership in electric competition continues to bring dramatic savings and economic benefits to pennsylvanians ridge said and according to this new report those savings and benefits will continue for some time to come we expect electric competition will help create more than three six zero zero zero jobs between one nine nine eight and two zero zero four and have a major positive impact on our states economy and millions of pennsylvania families and employers continue to save money on their electric bills without even lifting a finger savings from electric restructuring allow consumers more money to spend and invest creating positive multiplier effects on the state economy secretary of revenue robert judge said our research confirms that while consumers of electricity will realize rate reductions there are many other benefits to pennsylvania through electric competition judge said the public utility commission estimates that consumers will save nearly three billion by january two zero zero one due to electric competition the report includes an analysis of the effects of restructuring on sales tax and personal income tax revenue the one nine nine six restructuring law required that deregulation bring no net effect on immediate state tax collections the report says under the law the revenue department must report to governor and the general assembly providing information on tax revenues to enable lawmakers to judge the laws impact on the economy and to decide whether new laws are necessary to maintain tax revenue neutrality during the transition period the revenue neutral reconciliation the adjustment mechanism used to compare tax revenues collected before restructuring and after restructuring is working as intended the report says as required by the law the revenue department will produce two more reports for the general assembly and the governor one in august two zero zero one and one in august two zero zero two like pennsylvania some in ontario say the movement toward a competitive market for electricity has saved customers upwards of five zero zero million through rate reductions even though the ontario energy board oeb is currently considering scaling back or stopping the move to competitive markets one of the provinces largest utilities toronto hydroelectric says local regulators should recognize the savings from restructuring toronto hydro says the restructured market is successful because of the utilitys commitment to fair prices and safe reliable service in the new competitive electricity market since one nine nine three rates have fallen for all customer classes the utility claims we agree wholeheartedly with the need to protect consumers in the new electricity market toronto hydro vice president blair peberdy said as a municipal electric utility weve protected consumers to the tune of more than five zero zero million through rate reduction strategies for the past seven years our rates are one two five below the consumer price index and we have reduced rates since one nine nine three thats why were keen for the province to stay focused on introducing commercial reforms in the electricity distribution sector weve invested millions in preparing for the opening of the new energy marketplace already and were ready to go the utility warned against further forced rate reductions in light of the savings they have produced toronto hydro also called for regulators not to lower prices at the expense of more reliable service considering the rate freezes and reductions that toronto hydro has implemented since one nine nine three price minimization should not outweigh other objectives in the oeb act the testimony says protect consumers not just in terms of rates but also in terms of the quality of electric distribution services the company is also pushing for regulatory action to move along with competitive reform not to delay the developing market already in a transition phase because it might scare away new participants the government has put a solid foundation in place for the new electricity market peberdy said now is the time to look forward not back were excited about the potential for new investment new energy technologies and new business opportunities for toronto hydro

utilities fortnightly page one eight copyright c two zero zero one proquest information and learning all rights reserved copyright public utilities reports incorporated summer two zero zero one online ease and access are an empty promise in a flawed market clamor over the recent market exit of utilitycom billed as the worlds first internet utility was a wakeup call for the energy industry that failure along with the energy debacle in california raises questions about the viability of the internet as a vehicle for retail energy sales enrollments and fulfillment in particular and of electric and natural gas deregulation in general in the united states though nearly four zero million customers nine zero percent of them residential are eligible to choose their electric andor gas supplier more than eight five percent have remained with their incumbent utility distribution companies udcs of those who have switched just five percent were residential customers and fewer than one five percent used the internet for any part of the transaction another one zero million customers are expected to have choice by jan one odds are however that switching will remain limited despite widespread access to the internet and online signups that can make choice a simple matter of point and click the question is why the problem goes beyond the internet to the very foundations of energy deregulation at the root its a question of customer value independent power producers energy service providers esps and the utilities themselves sold energy restructuring on its promise of lower costs for consumers however the track record of other deregulated industries reveals that the reverse is often trueparticularly for mass market customers making retail choice meaningful for customers depends on amending the ground rules of deregulation though many needed initiatives lie in the hands of regulators it may be that the players that can be most influential in spurring action are the utilities and esps whose brands and fortunes are at stake during this transition why customers arent biting as i see it five fundamental problems are hindering the successful transition to competitive retail energy markets one risky business during regulation when energy prices were cost based and fixed udcs generated supply to meet demand up to capacity now many of the udcs willingly have sold their generating assets and agreed to share the risk of price fluctuations the result is an outofcontrol wholesale market in which generators maximize profits by manipulating supply to drive up prices udcs and esps forced to buy on the wholesale spot market get killed when their retail price is fixed by contract the result is that few esps are willing to risk taking title to wholesale energy for resale furthermore the california independent system operator has evidence that the states energy crisis actually arose not from increased demand but from reduced supply the reason says the iso is that generating facilities have cut capacity from last years levels for no apparent reason amidst such speculation mass market customers are reluctant to switch from the safe haven of their incumbent utilities two wheres the choice industries such as airlines and telecom demonstrate that deregulation leads to price discrimination with different customers being offered different prices as a result esps compete hotly for large customers with large loads that allow them to be creative strategically and still be profitable on the other hand residential and small commercial customers present such thin margins especially with mandated pricetobeat offers and rate reductions from the utility that esps cannot serve them profitably without automated enrollment and customer selfservice processes few esps have focused on automating these processes however during the regulated era utilities subsidized the cost of serving these small customers with the revenues earned from large accounts now it seems no one wants them for example enron completely abandoned the california residential market just three months after it opened in pennsylvania esps are dumping residential customers back to their incumbent utilities esps in ohio were forced to delay service to enrolled customers when their market support generation agreements with the incumbent utilities were not in place as expected all of this heightens fears among customers that their chosen esp will not be able to serve them or will vacate the market because they havent been educated to the contrary they fear they would be left without service or with some cost for switching to a new esp or back to their utility three online liquidity lacking the muchtouted retail auction exchanges are also struggling one reason is that when customers compare bids in todays pricey market to last years contract prices they dont perceive any savings second many commercial and industrial customers perceive no real price competition among retail suppliers for their contracts on an energy auction exchange they believe they will get more competitive bids by preparing requests for proposal and soliciting bids directly from suppliers four patchwork regulation because regulation varies by state and transactions vary by utility it is expensive and complex for esps to expand into different markets for example an esp willing to offer a franchise deal to a national chain say mcdonalds restaurants may find it virtually impossible to navigate the regulations and transactional requirements for working with the many utilities in all the states where the chain operates five but is that rate better a customer who visits a popular retail energy website such as essentialcom or energycom may be presented with a standard offer price from one esp is that a good price how does it compare to what he pays now most massmarket energy customers dont know add the fact that six five percent of all internet shoppers do not complete their purchase transactions and the problem is clear price discovery must be enhanced and the shopping and enrollment processes need to be simplified to attract novice energy buyers a todo list for building real choice the challenges i describe are formidable no one solution will address them all here are some important actions necessary to help break the logjam utilities and esps in particular can play a critical role in encouraging regulators at the state and federal levels to make needed changes cap wholesale prices energy companies are at the mercy of federal regulators to dampen wholesale market volatility they and state regulators should continue pressuring the federal energy regulatory commission to consider shortterm regional price caps on wholesale electricity to mitigate gaming of the markets the ferc also should require generators to publish their annual plans for scheduled downtime and force them to explain unplanned downtime form a megaexchange to promote liquidity in retail energy exchanges the operators of the various exchanges should consider pooling their resources to develop a universal exchange portalor at least a virtual exchangethat most or all of the largest customers could use that way customers and suppliers could go to one site and see all deals even if the deals were posted regionally behind the scenes such an exchange would offer various procurement vehicles including auction bidask and standard offer suppliers also would welcome a single site where they could see all qualified deals educate the public consumer education in deregulating markets clearly needs to go further regulators in these states could follow a strategy thats been moderately successful in several states collecting money from all participating utilities and esps to launch a campaign to increase the publics understanding of retail choice radio tv and print ads would explain the merits of deregulation demystifying the enrollment process and calming the fears of apprehensive customers through this type of program for example pennsylvania regulators saw mass market awareness of retail electric choice soar to nine four percent in just over a year utilities and esps can enhance these public awareness efforts by coordinating their own educational materials with the statewide campaign redouble marketing in line with the objectives to increase consumer awareness energy service providers need to do a better job of branding their service communicating their value proposition facilitating price discovery and targeting the actual buyer within commercial organizations this is a job for the professionals esps should hire and consult with madison avenue talent to develop branding and advertising campaigns esp websites should allow a prospective customer to enter basic information from their utility bill and calculate both the commodity charge and the distribution charge demonstrating the clear impact of switching on one months bill accuracy is critical often the esps have difficulty getting this calculation right themselves standardize transactions utilities and esps backed by a ferc directive should take the lead in developing national standards for electronic transactions including switching that would ease apprehension among customers make national contracting easier and reduce the investment required by energy suppliers to enter new markets phase out standard offers state regulators should consider speeding the elimination of udc price to beat and standard offers this price rigging creates a false economy with the customer adds undue price pressure to commodity prices and puts severe earnings pressure on utilities the crisis situation in california has made such potential consequences crystal dear aggregate the apathetic some municipalities have begun aggregating their residents to form residential aggregation pools that are attractive to esps and wholesale suppliers if the municipality successfully addresses customer apprehension and allows disinterested customers to opt out these aggregations can be an effective way to force choice in a community at least until the next general election energy companies and state regulators may be able to encourage aggregations by educating local officials on the benefits of such buying pools and providing materials for marketing to residents force choice state regulators can force all customers to choose an esp andor bar the incumbent utility from acting as an esp in texas for example utilities cannot prospect for new energy supply customers outside their territory until at least four zero percent of their franchise customers have chosen an alternative esp for gas deregulation in georgia all customers were assigned an esp in proportion to the market share each esp garnered in a pilot period energy companies may influence legislators in deregulating states as well as federal legislators to pursue this approach consider reregulation the ferc should consider guidelines to encourage states with volatile supply networks to reregulate or defer deregulation until the wholesale markets stabilize and the bugs have been ironed out of the deregulation process simplify rates state regulators should encourage utilities to simplify their rates for residential and small commercial customers that would allow retail suppliers and customers to more easily understand the rates and potential savings of switching to an esp deregulation will succeed only when all stakeholders put the success of the program before partisan interests without the undivided support of all parties there can be little improvement on the pseudocompetitive mire we see today it just doesnt work jeff felton is a consultant based in naples fla he has two two years

-- Reason Fdn work on electricity and Ken Lay,price caps will not solve the problem by adrian moore and lynn kiesling april one nine two zero zero one the drumbeat is again sounding for a return to wholesale price caps in californias electricity market while well intentioned such a move would be a grave mistake price controls have a history of distorting markets where competitive prices are possible leading to shortages of supply inadequate investment overconsumption and a myriad of other problems in the case of californias electricity crunch a return to price caps would only increase the threat of blackouts as the supply of electricity would not keep pace with californias appetite for power unfortunately state leaders pushing for price caps ignore historys lessons and seem destined to repeat past mistakes california already experimented with price caps and it was a dismal failure as californias wholesale power prices rose rapidly in the spring of two zero zero zero the state independent system operator iso quickly imposed a price cap as a result the amount of power supplied to the state decreased as suppliers pursued more lucrative opportunities elsewhere selling their power in states without price caps in fact imported electricity declined three three percent in two zero zero zero from the previous year consumer prices in twothirds of the state were not affected and consumers did not reduce demand scarcity turned into outright shortages iso staffers spent much of their time rounding up power to keep the lights on hour by hour rather than tending to the needs of the grid as supplies continued to fall the iso eventually lifted the caps to avert blackouts when a similar situation occurred across the midwest in one nine nine eight policymakers pursued a dramatically different course which resulted in a dramatically different outcome policymakers let market prices rise to attract both power and investment to the region and now new power plants are being built so if price caps are not the solution what is california must choose between two directions for its electricity market to move out of its current dysfunctional state a state takeover of the market which is the direction gov gray davis policies are leading or a transition to a deregulated market with real choices for customers given the success of deregulating electricity generation in states like pennsylvania and texas california should pursue the latter course but the transition will not be easy first and foremost california must articulate a vision of moving toward competition that will encourage new suppliers to enter the market too many state leaders are offering isolated policy ideas and conflicting proposals that do not inform the market in what direction policy is moving and what end state is sought in other cases the state is hanging a business not welcome sign on the door by scaring off wouldbe suppliers with highpitched rhetoric and threats of state takeovers once a clear vision is laid out california will need to move toward a system where consumers pay market prices for electricity as this is the only way to ensure that demand does not outpace supply but this move will inevitably cause some transition pains laying out a clear plan for this transition will make it easier for the public to deal with the state also can encourage utilities to implement realtime pricing and metering so consumers can adjust their use of electricity as prices change again by providing more information customers are better able to manage this transition but the state should ensure that utilities do not simply pass all of their previous losses onto consumers through increased prices the utilities helped contribute to the problem and must shoulder some of the costs finally if the state is going to move to a truly competitive market utilities must be free to purchase power competitively rather than trying to oversee every transaction through a central pool the state should encourage a voluntary independent competitive exchange and develop bidding rules that attract both buyers and sellers and enable utilities to purchase longterm contracts at lower prices granted the electricity crisis is no simple problem that the state can solve with the stroke of a pen or public speech about the need for conservation without a doubt it is going to cause some pain but beyond the shortterm difficulties california can still emerge with a robust reliable power supply that encourages new investment empowers consumers to choose providers of their choice and lowers the cost of the fuel our states hightech economy runs on a return to price caps would all but eliminate that prospect and shatter californias track record as a forwardlooking

imperils states financial health controller says updated march two one two zero zero one three one one pm californias powerbuying on behalf of two strapped utilities is gutting its budget surplus and putting the state at financial risk the state controller said wednesday the surplus dropped from eight five billion in january when the state began buying electricity for pacific gas and electric co and southern california edison to three two billion now kathleen connell estimates connell ordered an audit of the states powerbuying saying gov gray davis is withholding key financial information from her office and the legislature wednesday marked the first time in three days the state avoided rolling blackouts power grid officials credited cooling temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants connell said the energy crunch now imperils the states budget as well as its electric grid california has been spending about four five million a day four two billion so far to buy power for edison and pge both denied credit by electricity wholesalers the two utilities californias largest say they are nearly one four billion in debt due to soaring wholesale power costs the states deregulation law blocks them from recovering from customers meanwhile the state has faced high natural gas costs and a tight power supply driven in part by power plant repairs in california and scarce hydroelectric power in the pacific northwest standard poors has put the state on a credit watch due to its power purchases and chastised davis the legislature and state regulators for not taking more aggressive steps to assure the utilities can pay their bills on wednesday connell said she is refusing a request by davis and the legislature to transfer five six billion into a rainy day fund she said was set up to impress wall street as the state prepares to issue one zero billion in revenue bonds to cover its powerbuying transferring the money would leave the state general fund two four billion in debt connell said sandy harrison spokesman for the state department of finance and keely bosler of the legislative analysts office said such transfers are routine and required by law they put the states budget surplus at five six billion the law says she has to do it the law does not give her the power to demand that kind of audit information harrison said he said the states budget isnt in danger because it will be repaid with the one zero billion in longterm debt connell said the scope of the proposed transfer is unprecedented and amounts to a shell game that disguises the power purchases impact on the state budget wells fargo co chief economist sung won sohn said he sees little progress in efforts to fix the states power problems and end state electricity purchases if were going to pour money into a bottomless pit i would worry about the states finances he said at some point were going to run out of money the controllers criticism of fellow democrat davis won support from assembly republicans and secretary of state bill jones a republican considering challenging davis next year jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the states energy woes but cant unless davis releases more financial details he said his plan may involve giving the utilities lowinterest loans with their transmission lines held as collateral davis spokesman steve maviglio dismissed the criticism political grandstanding doesnt generate one more kilowatt of energy for california in this time of emergency he said maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it can without jeopardizing negotiations for longterm power contracts with wholesalers associated press,08:20:00,No

the money enron transparency not transparent enough in the money enron transparency not transparent enough by michael rapoport one one zero eight two zero zero one dow jones news service copyright c two zero zero one dow jones company inc a dow jones newswires column new york dow jones so enron corp ene says it wants to be more transparent to make its impenetrable financial results and corporate structure easier for investors and analysts to understand based on its announcements thursday however it still has a heck of a long way to go with enrons restatement thursday of nearly five years worth of earnings and additional information about the maze of offbalancesheet deals related to it we now have a lot more information about the mess at enron than we had two four hours ago but were not much closer to understanding just what happened to leave enron in such a mess and thats because the companys explanations of all this continue to be dense confusing and next to impossible to grasp try this tidbit from the form eight k enron filed about the restatements thursday with the securities and exchange commission in addition enrons net income is reduced for specific jedi revenues previously allocated to chewco relating to the appreciation in value of enron stock which eliminate upon consolidation this in effect reduces enrons share of jedis earnings huh and no it doesnt help you to know that chewco is an entity that wasnt included in enrons financial results but which enron now admits should have been or that jedi isnt a star wars reference but a limited partnership in which both enron and chewco had invested its still impenetrable then there are the times when enron just plain doesnt give enough information the company says its decision that chewco should be included in its results after all is based on current information that chewco did not meet the accounting criteria to qualify as unconsolidated uh okay why didnt it meet the criteria and why did enron previously believe that it did enron doesnt say finally enron makes some assertions that just make you scratch your head the company says part of the restatement of its earnings stems from unspecified prioryear proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications which were determined to be immaterial in the year originally proposed hmmm beyond the fact that enron doesnt elaborate on the nature of these audit adjustments and reclassifications or why they were originally considered immaterial consider that according to enrons own figures in the eight k they add up to a negative earnings impact of eight seven million since one nine nine seven that amount doesnt sound like any definition of immaterial ive ever heard an enron spokesman couldnt immediately be reached for comment in fairness this lack of clarity may be all but inevitable given enrons byzantine structure which involves dealings with outside but related entities that also have third parties involved which in one case have a subsidiary that allowed enron to hedge the risks of an investment and in another case is selling assets purchased from enron to other entities in order to finish paying enron for the original transaction and you get the idea its next to impossible to make clear because enrons structure is just too baroque to understand in the first place the market is plenty puzzled by all this even in the wake of enrons attempt to clarify things take a look at the companys drunkensailor stock chart from thursday after news of the restatements hit enron stock first jumped higher going as high as one zero a share then soon dropped back to as low as eight four zero as investors started to digest the details of the news then up again to about nine two five then down again to its current level of around eight five zero theres no reason investors should be confused like this there is absolutely no reason that a reasonably intelligent layman with an elementary working knowledge of corporate finance should be unable to understand the regulatory filings structure earnings and balance sheet of any public company if thats happens its the companys fault not the investors either because the company hasnt explained things well enough or because its structure is needlessly complicated to begin with if enron wants to get back the markets confidence fixing that problem one way or the other

evanslonectect fernley dysonlonectect subject status update on the issues surrounding continental power volatilities and correlations as you know for some time we have been trying to get the continental power traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option portfolio and for use in calculating their var as it has been obvious that the market has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in their mark in looking at the impacts of this various other issues came to light firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the var model as this was way out of date we have worked with jitendra and have now put in a matrix that both the traders risk and rac are happy with secondly as you may be aware in portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the deal ticket and not off any volatility curve the current portfolio is nine zero swaptions and so this represents a serious issue for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change we cannot use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options we also have not found any way in portcalc of valuing asian options so we are having to force in the few we have we have had the houston based portcalc it team work on a new piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of worrying bugs these are primarily that the proposed code does not take the correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of approximating the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the underlying they are currently being hampered in that they do not have any it personnel who have sufficient option knowledge i understand that the two most experienced coders resigned to go to another houston based energy company this is extremely worrying and i find it hard to believe that the whole of enrons power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the volatility at the deal ticket level this will almost certainly mean that different volatilities are being used in the var as are being used to value the swaption portfolio globally as well as these issues we have concerns over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in portcalc worryingly it does not seem that you can switch this off briefly it seems that portcalc calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the forward price of the underlying itself we have engaged london based it and are looking at the code we have used in power nine nine to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book asian options once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or gamma risk from portcalc in its current state as the information is just no there so we are told by it the system seems we cannot be one zero zero sure given all the other errors to produce a vega and gamma pl number but what the risk is remains a mystery again this is very worrying in that we have power option traders all over the world who cant get their underlying vega or gamma risk position from the global valuation system we are trying to work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but i would really like to know how the american based traders cope as they have this problem knowingly or not for years what sign offs were gained for the implementation of enpower because it seems to us that using the current system it is not possible to comply with the global risk policy how do we validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their var however as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily remark as jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their model vol curve generator i have today asked for a full explanation details of any testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle the swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility i would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been covered in houston some time ago

staff writer responding to calls for action from gov gray davis the california public utilities commission approved a limited rate freeze yesterday for electricity users in san diego where power bills have skyrocketed in recent months however the measure was harshly criticized by san diego officials and consumer activists as being an insufficient remedy for surging rates resulting from deregulation of the states electricity market they are now looking for relief from legislators in sacramento who are expected to vote today on a bill that would allow them to sidestep state energy regulators and impose more extensive restrictions on how much san diegans can be charged for power im extremely extremely disappointed said san diego county supervisor dianne jacob who flew up for yesterdays puc meeting in san francisco with other local officials former san diego mayor maureen oconnor urged california legislators to scrap the states electricity deregulation altogether to continue the farce so that the whole state is under this terrorist economic endeavor is just ridiculous she said oconnor added that bay area ratepayers should be concerned about what will happen when pacific gas and electric co lifts a freeze on its own electricity rates perhaps as soon as next summer we already have the train wreck in san diego she said its coming your way next the puc voted three to two to approve an immediate bill stabilization plan ensuring that most residential customers using five zero zero kilowatt hours or less in electricity would pay no more than six eight per month through jan three one two zero zero one their bills would be capped at seven five a month for the remainder of next year business customers using no more than one five zero zero kilowatt hours would have their monthly bills capped at two two zero until the end of january subsequently rising to two four zero a month michael shames executive director of san diegos utility consumers action network acknowledged that the average residence uses five zero zero kilowatt hours a month in juice but said this figure is skewed by inclusion of vacation homes apartments condominiums and other relatively low power users many san diego gas electric customers use double the amount of power stipulated in the pucs rate cap he said the pucs measure shames said does precious little for government schools hospitals and businesses who are currently being hit hard by the energy debacle restaurants bill soars one san diego business owner susan bauman said her restaurant used three zero zero zero zero kilowatt hours last month and that her monthly power bill doubled to more than one zero zero zero zero for the entire year she said her electricity bills will total more than one zero zero zero zero zero the commission just doesnt get it said mike florio an attorney for the utility reform network a san francisco consumer group the commissions vote was along party lines with the three republican appointees henry duque richard bilas and josiah neeper voting in favor and democratic appointees loretta lynch and carl wood dissenting lynch and wood had favored an alternative measure that would have applied the rate freeze to a greater number of customers in speeches prior to the vote san diego officials were unanimous in also supporting the more extensive proposal we did take some action today lynch the puc president said in an interview afterward but clearly this commission is not used to acting on an emergency basis a special puc meeting was scheduled after the governor taking heat for the states surging power costs called on the commission to provide relief for ratepayers in san diego the first california city to feel the full effects of deregulation davis said yesterday that he would have preferred passage of the more sweeping puc alternative but hailed the approved measure as clearly a step forward he reiterated his belief that electricity generators are gouging consumers average san diego power bills have more than doubled over the past four months as the local utility passes along rising wholesale costs to customers electricity generators are now being investigated by the puc the attorney generals office and other authorities to determine if they are manipulating prices as demand for juice far outstrips available supply lobbying begins after yesterdays puc vote the san diego officials who attended the meeting including four of five county supervisors and mayor susan golding piled into cars and headed for sacramento they said they will lobby legislators for passage of more farreaching rate relief this is affecting the health safety and welfare of everyone in our service area golding said we need relief and we need it now earlier this month the state senate voted two eight to zero to approve a plan to roll back san diego power rates to prederegulation levels passage of the bill in the assembly is now seen as more likely following the outcome of the puc meeting sen dede alpert dsan diego said yesterday that without additional measures local schools will be forced to pay about four five million in additional electricity costs using funds otherwise earmarked

the initial severance process completed it seemed an appropriate time to e ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future before i turn to the organizational changes i would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t he company as a result of the initial severance youll know who they are b y their absence on the organizational chart leading and being a part of t his group has been a privilegei am thankful for every day that i have had that responsibility and thankful for however long i continue to have the re sponsibility this sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat ed group of professionals and support staff and who to a person are also very decent and good people to say goodbye to some of our colleagues is not easy i want to on behalf of all of us thank them for their hard wor k their integrity their decency and the good times and laughter that we shared i trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done as to the organizational structure it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization with a mix of groups organized along fun ctional and regional lines particularly within the us has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times the nee d to rationalize the organizational structure in order to consolidate all us energy functions is a strong need from my perspective as a result jim steffes will lead the us energy group along with sue nord who will j ointly report to jim and myself sue will assist jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h elp jim shoulder a significant burden also reporting to jim will be a lea dership group for us energy that will be as follows wholesale electrici ty will be led by christi nicolay retail electricity and natural gas will be led by harry kingerski wholesale gas will be led by leslie lawner la st but not least jeff dasovich and sue mara who will continue to focus o n california energy issues will report to jim sue mara will also be part of the wholesale electricity team steve montovano who will continue to report to me will lead a commercial development effort along with dan allegretti with the elimination of the regional groups i also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our politicalleg islative needs across the us paul kaufman will lead a small group that w ill address that need and that will focus on state political support paul will also take the lead for government affairs in support of corporate dev elopment efforts across the us much of the rest of the group remains the same linda robertson will conti nue to lead the washington group with sarah novosel who reports to linda taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at ferc amr ibrahi m will continue to lead the support of the global assets group and also con tinue to manage the risk analytics function maggy huson will take over su pport of the nonenergy business units which are as follows global market s industrial markets networks and broadband rob hemstock will continue to lead the support of enron canada paul dawson who heads up government affairs for europe sergio assad who heads up government affairs for sout h america and mike grimes and mark crowther who head up our asian efforts will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself i am also forming a north american leadership group for government affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company that comm ittee will consist of rob hemstock maggy huson amr ibrahim paul kaufman harry kingerski leslie lawner steve montovano christi nicolay sue nord sarah novosel linda robertson jim steffes and myself we will also con tinue to have an rcr committee that will consist of maggy huson harry king erski sue nord linda robertson jim steffes myself

one six one nine pm thursday morning sessionmeeting with state commissioners this session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at ferc taking action without including them in the decision making process although the panel notice showed that five state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that two seven state commissioners were there and ready to claim their one five minutes of fame it was a long morning i will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts approximately three five to four zero of the commenters were supportive of ferc and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts most of these comments came from the midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support everyone else was fairly verbal against ferc primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that ferc was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens in particular the commissioners from maryland and north carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric while many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend sarah novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis heres some individual comments catherine rileymarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the maryland commission and immediately implied that ferc was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department she then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you ferc backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record it went on like this for about one five minutes the good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her sam ervinnorth carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an rto that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an rto and i bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of ferc his comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor arnetta mcraedelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are she also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order rory mcminnnew mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the ferc commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were carl woodcaliforniatried to portray himself and california as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the washington commission echoeing his comments he delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverferc should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc glen thomaspennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc he was very supportive of pjm makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any rto to be effective it must have independent governance judy jonesohiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed don svandas comments from earlier in the week that one rto for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the ferc to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed ed garveyminnesotahe got the gold star for the day after very very lengthly comments from about one five commissioners he took about one minute and said fercjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward other commissioners who talked were arthurconnecticut hadleyindiana huelsmankentucky nugent maine all on the positive side other negative commentors were two guys from dc and jim irvin from arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do from the ferc commissioner standpoint the gold star went to massey after hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that ferc had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been seven years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for seven years and never could agree call me if i

securities and exchange commission is looking into the fastowrelated transactions in my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo said chief executive kenneth lay in a statement enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships ljm cayman lp and ljmtwo coinvestment lp which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company mcmahon who had been serving as chairman and ceo of enrons industrial markets group had quit his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about fastows role in running the two partnerships according to the wall street journal this morning salomon smith barney analyst raymond niles downgraded enron to buy speculative from buyhigh risk to reflect his concerns that lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair enrons commercial operations this is the least likely outcome in our view but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked he

enron dealings two zero zero one one zero two five one four one three new york by mark golden kristen mcnamara jon kamp and john edmiston of dow jones newswires new york dow jonesenergy trading companies have concerns about the credit quality of troubled enron corp ene but they have made almost no changes in policies concerning the top trader of north american power and gas the companies said thursday the concerns have arisen because enron which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the countrys power and gas markets has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure moodys has put enrons credit on watch for possible downgrade and some of the companys debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week we have made no changes to our credit policy concerning enron said john sousa chief spokesmann for dynegy inc dyn its business as usual williams cos wmb spokesman jim gipson said that his company too has made no changes and has no concerns about enrons credit another top one zero power and gas trading company aquila ila has also left enron credit unchanged other companies expressed concern though theyve taken little if any action like everyone else in the marketplace were proceeding with caution said lora kinner director of credit for tractebel energy marketing the north american subsidiary of the belgian company tractebel sa kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesnt expect to make any drastic changes calif guarantees allow williams to book power revenues by andrew dowell of dow jones newswires one zero two five two zero zero one dow jones energy service copyright c two zero zero one dow jones company inc new york dow jones clarifications by california as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled williams cos wmb to book one eight zero million in power sales from the previous period as thirdquarter revenues the company said thursday the revenues came from power williams sold through the california independent system operator which runs the states wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions the state of california has paid more than one one billion for power bought directly from suppliers but has yet to pay for any iso power since it took over the job of buying power for the states ailing utilities in midjanuary two weeks ago however the state made clear for the first time which iso transactions it would back its that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the california iso williams chief operating officer steven malcolm said on a conference call wednesday williams reported thirdquarter net income of two two one three million on revenues of two eight one billion up from one two one one million on revenues of two three three billion in the same period the year before williams is now in talks with california to secure payment for its iso sales the process is complicated by the states role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities which arent creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves the iso didnt envision thirdparty guarantors when it set up its settlement process and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the iso each month state power officials have said the state says it has set aside one two billion to cover iso transactions as reported suppliers including williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free willing to renegotiate separately williams officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its longterm contracts with california provided the result benefited both parties california gov gray davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as two zero years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of powersupply obligations perhaps freeing up supply that williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market malcolm said were always willing to sit down with a customer malcolm said williams hasnt been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts malcolm said any attempt by california to force through onesided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants he said to the extent contracts are changed financing is going to go away he said downplaying enron opportunities williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of marketleader enron corp ene saying it focuses on large longterm structured deals not the highvolume physicalmarket transactions that enron dominates malcolm said also tradespark the internetbased energy exchange in which williams is a partner is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from enrons proprietary system enrononline because of the horrific losses operator cantor fitzgerald xcfz suffered in the attacks on the world trade center thats interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing williams chief executive keith bailey said on the call enron which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the countrys power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on enrononline has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure those concerns have raised questions about the business model of enrononline a platform on which enron is the counterparty in all trades those concerns could eventually boost volume on

weve got to shift gears into this enron situation which has just beenyouve been talking about it quite a bit davidhow could you not talk about it seventysix million shares yesterday down fifty percent in the last two weeks this is a company withwhata hundred million in revenues james cramer guest market commentator maybe kernen yeah right anyone who does any trading in energy apparently you know uses enron online so anything that destabilizes enron to a great extent could destabilize the whole energy trading arena and cramer go ahead say it say what youre thinking no one has said it yet we know the truth we believe that enron caused a national short squeeze they knew every single number in this gas situation they wrecked the california utility system and profited from it thats my bet my bet that thisthey hadlook they were the market maker imagine if instinet knew what you were going to be buying and took it ahead of you i think they cornered the market for electricity for about four months made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and when someonewhen the justice department gets in there were going to discover this kernen lets see what happened haines now wait a second david faber coanchor whoa whoa whoa the justice department jim now is that new is that something cramer no that would be if i were a prosecutor something faber ok so they are not being investigated cramer well no im actually being a little forward thinking kernen the sec wants documents about the limited partnership transactions of mr faber which is very different from what jim is talking about cramer no im saying that this is what if i were an enterprising prosecutor i would say did we have a nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly what was happening with the electricity market which then wrecked the california utility system cost the consumer billions of dollars and is now being hushed up kernen well lets talk about the actual news heres yesterdays trading haines wait a minute kernen well i just want to say that the guy is gone now thats the new news here did you readdid you know that fastow after four faber late yesterday kernen yeah after four oclock fastow is gone whats interesting faber hes the cfo kernen but hes a new cfo faber who benefitted personally from some of these off balance sheet partnerships cramer mark you know im not on thin ice here im not on thin ice haines i just want to make sure we understand that this is your theory cramer this is my theory haines ok cramer it is just a theory it is my opinion but i think weve got to find out more about that short squeeze that occurred haines ok cramer we need to find out whether it was orchestrated kernen the new cfo might help regain some credibility for the company because he was the old treasurer who left that position a year or so ago because of some disagreements with how mr fastow was doing business apparently so now hes back as cfo and well whether that calms the market down faber well what they need to do joe they need to come clean i mean that is what all the investors in enron and those whove left the company as investors over this last week have wanted lets see everything be as transparent as you possibly can be tell us exactly what we need to know and as much as they need to come clean with their investors they need to come clean with their trading counterparties because that is really what people are concerned about kernen why is the credit worthiness issue such a big deal anyone who does trading with them if their credit worthiness were to goif their credit rating were to go down how would that affect energy trading faber well you want to know that theyre going to be there on the other side and make good on the trades kernen i guess you would wouldnt you faber right not that they arent but why would youif you can trade with seven other guysseven other companies maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there kernen now why would faber and that would hurt their core business kernen why are people expecting some type of action from the credit agencies not because of the stock price right because of something that could unravel faber because of something related to these liabilities they may have kernen that they dont know about at this point faber that they may have with regard to funding some of these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at the off balance sheet partnership will it be a liability they dont know but thats one of the reasons kernen were talking hundreds of millions or billions faber they dont know kernen but there were billions of dollars in limited partners faber yes about three billion in financing i think is what some analysts estimated kernen this is a pretty big number faber yeah they can get to most of that with the assets that they have in the partnerships themselves kernen i use a six month chart to show whats happened over the last two weeks you got to look at here but if we went back a year youd see eighty as far as the high for enron now were at sixteen faber everybody else took a hit yesterday dynegy got hurt kernen well i got dynegy next dont here we go faber im sorry im getting a little excited kernen you are faber enthusiastic about your charts kernen theres a weekly chart of dynegy and you know whats coming next dont you now im worried about the utility average ive worried about the transportation average a lot in my career mark now the utilities have replaced my worries im angstridden did you see this chart were breaking below the cramer thats a positive not a negative joe kernen whats wrong with cramer today what happened cramer im all fired up faber he really is my god hes got the doj getting all crazy the fbi the cia you going down to enyou going down to houston yourself cramer i may just have to i may have to clean up that whole city kernen jim why would thethats thenow getting down to the lows i mean the other averages have come back quite a bit from the postattack lows the utilities are retesting those thats not something to worry about cramer no because i think theres a lot of money going into more cyclical issues i think the economy is showing signs of getting better the consumer is certainly much stronger than we thought the base book didnt say the corporate was strong but the consumer is strong much stronger than before kernen all right in the past people have worried about the utility averages being a leading indicator though i dontwere talking about four hundred to twoninety at this point thats a long way cramer this average has got a lot of problems to it but i still think that kernen its no longer the cramer you sell this as safety we dont want safety as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality,11:22:21,No

showed saturday they are ready for prime time too chris simms connected with senior brandon healy for a six three yard passandrun play to open the scoring but then the freshmen took over major applewhite found johnson just breaking past cb quentin jammer for a seven five yard passandrun touchdown against the firstteam defense it was the first touchdown the secondteam has scored against the defensive starters in their two scrimmages johnson made a great catch in traffic then turned on the speed to complete the long scoring play vasher however had the longest scoring jaunt of the day bolting seven nine yards on a punt return he made a couple of great moves to get started then used his speed to outrun the pursuit beau trahan who was moved from safety to quarterback last week threw a beautiful pass to thomas for a one five yard scoring play simms again took all the snaps for the first team and applewhite last years cobig one two offensive player of the year again worked with the second team brown said no decision has been made on which qb will be the starter in the season opener but he did say no significance should be given to the fact the simms has worked with the first team throughout the first two scrimmages he said the coaches know what applewhite can do with the first team and they want to see what simms can do with the first team simms leading the starters against the secondteam defense had only slightly better statistics than applewhite who went against the defensive starters all day simms completed seven of one seven passes for one four two yards with the six three yard touchdown pass to healy he also gave up an interception by backup linebacker o j mcclintock applewhite completed six of one eight passes for one one nine yards including the td pass to johnson he also allowed a pick by walkon defensive back chad davis backup tbs victor ike and ivan williams led the rushers with three four and two five yards respectively ike had seven carries and williams had five the firstteam defense which was no six in the nation last year in yardage allowed has been very stingy against the run throughout the fall drills healy led the receivers with four catches for one zero two yards but johnson was close behind with two grabs for nine four yards coach mack brown thanked the approximately two zero zero zero longhorn fans who attended the nine three zero am scrimmage and he said the players were tired but still gave a great effort he said williams hurt his shoulder but it was not serious and did not prevent him from going back in the game he also said vasher showed great quickness on his scoring punt return and said he will probably be used on some punt returns this year the firstteam offense scored on its first possession against the secondteam defense when simms found healy open all alone down the middle but the secondteam defenders held the starters without another score the secondteam defense is much more talented this year

commission meeting held yesterday and additional intelligence gathered from ferc staffers after the meeting we are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues generally the order is expected to expand the scope of the commissions april two six order and this report will highlight the differences geographical scope mitigation is extended to cover all one one western states term the term of the order will be extended to cover two summers we expect the order to issue today if so the order will take effect at midnight tonight and continue in effect until nine three zero zero two spot market defined as sales of two four hours or less transacted on the day of delivery or the day prior to delivery must sell to prevent physical withholding the plan will require all sellers to offer all their available power in real time all california generators even those not subject to ferc price regulation will be required to sell into the isos real time market sellers in the rest of the wscc are similarly required to sell except that they are not required to sell into california and can choose their spot market they will be required to post available power on the western systems power pool board hydroelectric facilities will continue to be exempted price mitigation expanded to be in place two four hours per day seven days per week applies to all sellers including marketers and nonpublic utilities the plan retains a single market clearing price auction for the spot market based on marginal cost bids the proxy price formula is changed in several respects one gas price will be the average of the midpoint of the monthly bid week prices as reported in gas daily for malin socal gas large packages and pge city gate two om increases from two to six three fuel startup and emissions costs are eliminated from the formula and uplifted from the iso ie these costs will be recovered from the iso but will not go into setting the proxy price four similarly a credit adder of one zero will apply only in ca a reserve deficiency in ca seven or less also triggers mitigation for the rest of the wscc the applicable price during reserve deficiency periods is the proxy price outlined above during times when no reserve deficiency exists the mitigated price will be eight five of the highest price calculated in the last stage one emergency this price will be in effect until the next stage one emergency sellers can bid higher than the proxy with justification during periods of reserve deficiency or when no reserve deficiency exists provided that marketers may not bid above the proxy price ferc will consider the entire portfolio of a seller who seeks to justify a higher price than the proxy generators may seek cost based rates for their entire portfolio in ca if they so choose ie no cherry picking demand side management the plan originally set forth in the april two six order is expected be removed in this order iso reporting iso will need to report on a quarterly basis as to the status of building supply in ca comments comments will be sought on the issue of whether the price mitigation formula should be adjusted in response to expected varying load conditions due to seasonal changes settlement conference the settlement judge will convene a settlement conference on the refund issue no later than june two five next monday and the parties will have one five days to settle a report from the judge to the commission is due seven days thereafter for a total of two two days issues that are not expected to be addressed in the order include confidentiality iso board issues iso scheduling penalty application and market based rate authorization the order is not finally issued as of yet and the status of the foregoing items could change

elaine korry reporting since january california energy regulators have been slashing red tape to speed new power plants online their tracking one eight zero separate projects bob thurkelsen who overseas permitting at the california energy commission says the governors emergency directive has already paid off mr bob thurkelsen california energy commission and that has allowed us to so far permit four five zero megawatts of new generation in a two one day period korry in a few cases even quicker than that jim michael is the president of alliance power based in denver which sprinted through its permit process in under three weeks mr jim michael alliance power well were pouring concrete were on schedule so were gonna have power plants operating this summer korry alliance is building two small generators in southern california michael says permitting projects that used to take months were instead completed in a day or two allowing the company to meet critical deadlines mr michael it was essential without that streamlining these projects would have gone away the turbines would have been sold to other projects outside of california and so we would have essentially failed korry yet theres still a major hitch despite the speedup in permitting california will still fall far short of the governors initial goal he wanted five zero zero zero new megawatts of electricity enough to power five million homes to come online by july one st in a worstcase scenario thats how much additional supply the state would need to keep the lights on this summer yet only half that amount two five zero zero megawatts will be up and running by july jan smutnyjones heads the industry lobbying group the independent energy producers association hes not surprised by the shortfall mr jan smutnyjones independent energy producers association we said at the time that was a very ambitious goal and well see how it plays out korry smutnyjones says blackouts are a near certainty this summer their severity will depend on a number of unknowns how hot will it get this summer how much more can californians skimp on electricity and how much wattage will the power wholesalers themselves take off line power producers have been charged with deliberately shutting down plants to keep prices high smutnyjones has a different explanation for the down time mr smutnyjones californias electric power system is rapidly aging we have not built a power plant of an appreciable amount in over a decade and therewhile theres power plants being built now the average age of these power plants is in excess of three six years old thats the average age which means that a significant amount of the fleet is older than that they break down korry the industry itself is partly to blame for the aging fleet the energy commission did license small generators during the one nine nine zero s and if bigger ones werent built its largely because the energy producers themselves balked at building them chris seiple with rdi consulting says construction slowed everywhere that is until last year since two zero zero zero he says nine zero zero zero zero new megawatts of energy have come online nationwide thats more capacity in two years than was built during all of the one nine nine zero s and now comes the bush national energy policy urging even greater production according to seiple we could wind up with too much of a good thing mr chris seiple rdi consulting so we really expect that inwhatfive zero markets we will go from a situation of having shortages to having too much supply korry in yesterdays speech president bush repeated the administrations claim that the nation will need at least one three zero zero additional power plants over the next two decades seiple says an

detailed hearing the commission president tells a senate panel that maintenance records show no valid reason for generators to cut power production byline robert j lopez rich connell times staff writers body the head of the california public utilities commission friday provided fresh details showing that power generators scaled back electricity production and then benefited from the resulting high prices in sworn testimony before a state senate committee puc president loretta lynch said the companies behavior helped drain so much electricity from the states grid that officials were forced to declare emergency alerts lynchs testimony followed her comments thursday to the times that state investigators have found evidence of power plants being shut down unnecessarily to create artificial shortages often when the state was most desperate for electricity during her testimony friday lynch went beyond her assertions about unnecessary plant shutdowns and accused generators of also needlessly throttling back generation the puc and state atty gen bill lockyer are jointly investigating the exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost california billions and brought major utilities to financial ruin generators have said they never engaged in any conduct intended to manipulate wholesale electricity prices including unnecessarily shutting down their plants or reducing supply the facilities they say are aging and have run so hard during the states crisis that they often require extensive maintenance but the details released by friday by lynch added to the questions surrounding the generators activities lynch displayed charts that track electricity prices and power generation at three plants on a single day last november after the plants reduced production during the middle of the day the graphs show the state was forced to declare two separate power emergencies because electricity reserves had fallen seriously low the shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices with that the companies operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity production to almost full capacity allowing them to capitalize on the much higher rates we certainly see a pattern lynch told the committee which is investigating alleged manipulation of the states wholesale power market by energy suppliers many generators are playing on their experience and playing to an extent california maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no valid reasons for the plants to cut back production lynch said she declined to identify the power plants involved saying only that they are owned by at least two companies sen joseph dunn dsanta ana who heads the special committee investigating alleged market manipulation said lynchs information on its face is very damning he said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence showing that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar behavior we are looking at data that is suspicious dunn said during a break in fridays hearing a spokeswoman for a trade group of major power suppliers said there have been no coordinated efforts to shrink supplies to increase profits there has been no collusion said jean munoz of the independent energy producers assn she said many of the plants bought by outofstate generators under californias flawed deregulation plan are more than three zero years old the plants have been running at high levels to help the state with its energy crunch she said munoz told reporters that the plants owned by outofstate companies last year produced six zero more electricity than the previous year although no firm has been singled out by the puc or the attorney generals office atlantabased mirant corp said inspectors have visited company plants more than one zero zero times this year and have found no wrongdoing mirant has run its plants voluntarily and continually throughout the crisis the company said in a statement friday but lynch said friday that visits to more than eight zero plants by puc investigators since december show that generators are not always producing all the power they can it appears that there have been numerous instances within the past halfyear where generation units were not producing the amount of electricity that they were capable of producing lynch said loaddate may one nine two zero zero one copyright

houstonbased reliant energyand tie them to the president from texas its why he keeps repeating mr president you didnt create this problem but you are the only one who can solve it davis also thinks its conceivable a pressured president will reverse himself and support temporary price caps if not that some creative price relief one option he says is for ferc to acknowledge the massive gouging and order huge refunds until lately davis had been deferential toward the new president initially the governor felt he could reason with the bush administration says garry south his political advisor but

power demands set stage for boom in backup systems byline by jon van body electricity deregulation is just one trend thats putting a big smile on the faces of folks at schneider electrics north american division in palatine these days theres also the rapid growth of electronic gear that requires electric current that flows without interruption or variation and the concern over reliability of the public power grid the new complexity is pushing electrical power from commodity status into a new category as a resource that requires a lot of expertise and schneider executives are devising strategies to take advantage of the new situation schneider parent to the square d brand of electrical control products is telling customers that its shortsighted of them to buy transducers circuit breakers and the like from the lowest bidder instead goes this argument they need to turn over their electrical needs to schneider to provide an end solution instead of a lot of piecemeal products were saying you have to spend money to save money said amelia huntington schneiders strategic accounts vice president californias electrical outages and the problems of chicagos commonwealth edison a few years ago have convinced many business managers of the wisdom of having a backup supply of electrical power for when the grid goes dead she said schneider hopes to enter some agreements with customers to own and maintain electrical infrastructure on their premises in a feeforservice arrangement that goes beyond the traditional deal where schneider sells equipment that a customer then owns operates and maintains so far the firm hasnt sealed such a deal but it has had talks with customers along those lines huntington said it does have several customers that have moved away from traditional open bidding relationships with multiple vendors an example is an ibm plant that uses one three zero kilovolts to fabricate computer chips around the clock seven days a week any loss of power even for a fraction of a second could cost the plant millions of dollars huntington said electrical power used to be something that was a given and manufacturers didnt think about it much

aggressive implementation in recent memory fiber provides so much informationcarrying capacity that a single strand of glass can carry tv programs highspeed internet and napster music downloads with excess capacity to spare but it may not get much beyond the experimental stage suggests a local consultant scott bender a chicagobased vice president of bain co said that despite the technology lure of bringing fiber to residences the economic feasibility of fiber to the home remains elusive the problem bender said is the cost of the equipment that converts the photons of light that travel on optical fiber into electrons that make computers televisions and phones work why spend hundreds of dollars for electronics at every home bender asked instead you can bring fiber into a neighborhood and have one set of electronics handle many customers using copper wire to make the connection for the last few hundred feet the fact is that copper can provide all the bandwidth that any homebased application requires even though bender is skeptical that the market is ready for fiber to the home just yet he doesnt criticize sbc management for trying it every major carrier probably should do

customers byline by karen gaudette associated press writer dateline san francisco body a little calculation on electric bills is fast becoming a big concern for millions of residential customers of californias two largest utilities sitting near the top of southern california edison electric bills and near the bottom of the last page of pacific gas and electric bills is a number called baseline which guarantees a certain amount of electricity at the lowest price utilities charge this number which differs from customer to customer based on a host of factors is the benchmark for determining how much more residents will pay for electricity come june when the largest rate hikes in california history start showing up on bills now with deregulation and prices being so much higher its going to require that people educate themselves about their bills the same way they had to do when long distance telephone service was deregulated said commissioner carl wood of the public utilities commission under a ratehike allocation plan approved tuesday by the puc everyone who exceeds baseline by more than three zero percent will pay progressively more for that additional electricity with the heaviest residential users facing a three seven percent average hike on their overall bill translating to an increase of roughly eight five a month state law ensures that residential customers who dont use more than three zero percent above baseline will not face the rate hikes the puc figures around half of pge and edison customers now fall into that category but consumer rights groups and even the utilities think the puc is underestimating residential electric use given the recent proliferation of home computers cell phone chargers and the like they think baseline is set too low for many customers and say families and people who work at home will pay more than their fair share of the rate hikes its an antifamily action people with kids have a hard time staying within baseline said mike florio senior attorney with the utility reform network a rate hike of three zero to four zero percent could be one zero zero percent for people with large households since one nine eight two when lawmakers created baseline given in cents per kilowatt hour per month to ensure a minimum amount of affordable power and encourage conservation the puc has determined baseline by dividing the state into climatic and geographic regions pge has one zero such regions within its service territory in northern and central california edison has six in central and southern california the puc then finds the average amount of electricity use for customers within each region the baseline quantity is five zero percent to six zero percent of that amount and up to seven zero percent of that amount during the winter months if a customer uses only one type of energy electricity or natural gas customers who depend on electronic medical equipment such as suction breathing and dialysis machines can apply for a slightly higher baseline a family living in the scorching hot coachella valley would have a larger allotment of lowerpriced electricity than a family living in breezy monterey given that air conditioning for the former is necessary to survival since baseline is based on averages a single apartment dweller and a family of four who live in the same region could have the same baseline that makes it more likely for the family to get hit with rate hikes and less likely economists fear that the apartment dweller has a financial incentive to conserve where it is imperfect is that it has no ability to make any adjustments for the size of the family said john nelson a pge spokesman focusing baseline on household size gets complicated florio said does pge come by and do bed checks along with raising five seven billion to replenish the states general fund for power buys since january the rate hikes approved march two seven by the puc and allocated on tuesday were also meant to trigger conservation that could help avoid rolling blackouts this summer baseline has not been reassessed since the early one nine nine zero s puc president loretta lynch and fellow commissioner wood say they may hold hearings as early as this coming week on possible inequities and ways to update the system there was plenty of testimony at public hearings that people suspect that baselines are not appropriate or are not calculated right wood said wood said when baseline first was created nearly two zero years ago houses were smaller and many lacked central air conditioning though the puc has updated baseline amounts through the years living standards have changed housing standards have changed and it may be that average usage is different from what it was wood said florio said giving baselines a second look could go either way for consumers there are typically more electronic gadgets in homes these days but many of those gadgets and appliances are more energy efficient than their ancestors add that to increased conservation statewide florio said and theres a slim chance baselines could actually go down and expose more customers to rate hikes its a percentage of average use historically and people have used energy more efficiently through the years florio said on the net california public utilities commission httpwwwcpuccagov pacific gas and electric co httpwwwpgecom

detailing how such a plan would work the idea is to provide a lot of information so people can make choices to live with blackouts on a temporary basis this summer keeley said peter navarro a university of california irvine economics professor released a report last month with a consumer group that recommends the state set a price limit on what theyll pay for power and if generators dont lower the price the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption he said the report by navarro and the utility consumers action network says the states current method of highly disruptive random rolling blackouts needs to be revamped ucan suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and for a certain duration scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas keeley acknowledged and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off that is a genuine problem and genuine concern keeley said i think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell their unused electricity to other states or trim back production

of time when they would have their power cut we owe the people of this state some kind of schedule briggs said if businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be shut off or blacked out they could plan for that blackout accordingly the central valley republican said the ability to plan for outages would be especially benefit farmers who need power to irrigate their crops assembly speaker robert hertzberg who convened a special subcommittee on blackouts has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily blackouts to cut the states power use and drive down prices democratic assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan sen debra bowen dmarina del rey has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular period so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends and by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort the state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices bowen said california power consumers would in essence form a reverse cartel to stop the market manipulation and the price gouging she said the planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer even beyond the extraordinary levels

exclusive responsibility to ensure that energy prices are reasonable bush so far has tried to stay above the fray letting his aides respond to criticisms its time to leave behind rancorous old arguments and build a positive new consensus the president said saturday in his weekly radio address but the rancor is certain to continue the democratic congressional campaign committee on saturday announced the launch of a monthlong radio and television advertising campaign targeting republican lawmakers whom they blame for not doing enough to ease the energy crunch the campaign specifically criticizes rep stephen horn rlong beach for opposing a temporary cap on electricity prices it is scheduled to start monday with a three zero second spot that ends with a message urging viewers to call horns offices for immediate action californias energy crisis is deepening with summer blackouts predicted and rate hikes of up to eight zero the ad states yet president bush has offered no relief to hardpressed ratepayers our representative steve horn has joined with bush in opposing a temporary cap on electricity prices call horn and tell him we need action now mark nevins a committee spokesman said the ad campaign is part of an effort to hold horn and fellow republicans accountable for lack of leadership on the energy issue horns party controls the house the senate and the white houseand they have yet to do a thing to provide some immediate relief to californias families nevins said house minority leader richard a gephardt dmo called on bush on saturday to endorse temporary price caps to stop what he termed one zero and even two zero fold increases in californians energy bills appearing on cnns evans novak hunt shields gephardt also said bush should have included his tax incentives for energy conservation in the giant tax cut bill that is moving through congress the good parts of his plan are not in his budget and not in his tax bill which really makes a mockery of what hes really suggesting gephardt said were putting through this week supposedly a one three trillion tax cutprobably the biggest tax cut in our history and theres not a penny in it for the energy stuff that he suggested this week the presidents energy plan calls for greater production of power and fuel tax breaks for conservation and construction of new nuclear plants two of its most controversial elements are opening alaskas arctic national wildlife refuge for drilling and giving federal agencies power to force landowners to sell property needed for new electricity transmission lines responding to growing complaints from environmentalists bush insisted that new technologies would enable the nation to boost energy production without hurting the environment too often americans are asked to take sides between energy production and environmental protection bush said the truth is energy production and environmental protection are not competing times staff writer robert marosi in

line that conservation alone will not solve the problem that more energy sources must be generated and on the oped pages of fridays wall street journal he sought to counter complaints that the plan is antienvironment and would only help big business americans love and want an unlimited supply of affordable energy but they dont like virtually each of the sources that provide it abraham said in a recent interview coal is too dirty nuclear isnt safe hydropower kills fish windmills threaten birds his mission is to persuade the people otherwise it is a job that comes with little power and lots of room for blame the department of energy which thensen abraham sought to abolish in one nine nine nine shares splintered authority with several other agencies what it does command is often controversial the nuclear weapon labs that came under scrutiny after security breaches at its los alamos nm facility and oversight of the nations aging nuclear arsenal but his greatest challenge is likely to come this summer in california when anticipated electricity shortages will cause the lights to go out air conditioners to shut down and whopping utility bills to arrive in the mail then abraham is poised to become californias pinata the federal official who gets the stick because bush administration critics will argue the federal government has failed to deliver the caps on wholesale

congressional agenda he loyally opposed abortion rights and favored free trade his environmental record earned him the sierra clubs lowest rating but he made his mark by successfully challenging party leaders when they sought to reduce legal immigration to the united states he spent more time working in the back rooms of congress than in its limelight he likes to tell the story of one early turn presiding over the senate when he forgot about the live microphone and was caught on cspan humming the childrens song do you know the muffin man his supporters note hes a quick study a harvardeducated

must solve its energy problem largely on its own california keeps saying why wont washington do something abraham said reiterating his opposition to electricity price caps he believes will only prolong the crisis but he added the first call i made as secretary of energy was to gov davis were not leaving any stones unturned if abraham was not practiced in front of the camera in his early

body california will mark but certainly not celebrate an anniversary this week it was exactly one year ago that a late spring heat wave swept over san diego and as air conditioners began drawing heavy amounts of power san diego gas electric co began charging its customers high marketoriented rates for juice it was the beginning of the california energy crisis or at least of public and political awareness that something was wrong and a year later every aspect of the crisis continues to grow worse we are paying one zero times as much for power as we were two years ago we have amassed more than two zero billion in private and public debt that will grow even with sharp increases in consumer power rates and we face potentially lifethreatening summer blackouts certainly the roots of the crisis extend much further than one year they go back to decisions in the one nine seven zero s to stop major power plant construction and rely on conservation and alternative generating sources and they include a momentous decision in the midone nine nine zero s to adopt a deregulation plan that was an unworkable hybrid of open markets and price controls that left us at the mercy of outofstate generators of more currency is what was and wasnt done in the last one two months to fan that spark into a uncontrolled and perhaps uncontrollable firestorm gov gray davis once said that he was approaching energy just as he plays golf one hole at a time unfortunately for davis and for the state it was not a golf game but one of threedimensional and perhaps fourdimensional chess to manage the crisis effectively the democratic governor needed the ability either personally or through trusted aides to pull together its disparate elements into a cohesive whole the golfing approach was evident from the beginning as davis dealt with only the most immediate aspects of the situation as they evolved rather than embracing it wholly and actively private and public energy experts warned that what was happening in san diego was a harbinger of a larger crisis and proposed that the one nine nine six deregulation be suspended that rates be raised slightly and that private utilities be given broad authority to enter into longterm supply contracts to stabilize the market but davis and his handpicked state public utilities commission president loretta lynch stalled for time less than a month after the crisis first surfaced the puc voted three two to authorize longterm supply contracts at about five cents a kilowatthour slightly higher than wholesale prices had been but ridiculously cheap by contemporary standards publicly owned utilities saw the looming price escalation and quickly locked up longterm supplies but lynch denounced the commission action as a wrong turn that could lead to higher consumer bills and within days it was scuttled in legislation signed by davis rather than face the issue comprehensively and proactively davis lynch and the legislature opted for an expedient fix in san diego rolling back retail rates without addressing either supply or cost issues within weeks private utilities were beginning to take on billions of dollars in debt as wholesale costs skyrocketed last summers failure to act was compounded by other errors of judgment its clear now for example that it was a mistake for the state to continue buying power at skyhigh rates when the utilities had exhausted their credit having a new deep pocket encouraged the generators to charge whatever the market would bear a year after he could have nipped the crisis in the bud but didnt davis is busily rewriting history and blaming others principally republicans for the dilemma but the governor cannot or should not escape the responsibility for approaching this very complex situation like a game of golf or like some routine political dispute and thus failing to apply the aggressive and sophisticated managerial touch that this crisis demanded from the onset as gen george mcclellan

californias energy grid they have a new job responding to more than four zero detailed subpoenas the data the iso keeps on electricity transactions are central to the halfdozen investigations initiated by state and federal agencies into various parts of the states energy mess including possible criminal activity by power generators theyre asking for everything and then some a spokeswoman for the iso stephanie mccorkle said sighing the federal energy regulatory commission the state public utilities commission the assembly the senate the state attorney general and a phalanx of state and federal auditors all are boring into californias energy mess the main thrust of the most significant investigations is the conduct of power generators that have reaped record profits selling electricity to the electronstarved state although most investigators say the isos logs and bid records show the various generators used their market share to drive up prices the issue is whether they did so acting collaboratively either directly or indirectly generators deny any manipulation of the market they say their prices simply reflect a lack of supply plant breakdowns and the high cost of natural gas but that hasnt stopped the state from trying to prove them wrong attorney general bill lockyer has been probing the actions of the generators since august to see if they manipulated the market or engaged in unfair business practices or if their executives engaged in criminal behavior we all feel weve been taken advantage of been gouged lockyer said the question is whether its legal greed or illegal greed theres no question its greed lockyer is in court fighting energy companies like reliant energy inc and dynegy which have refused to disclose internal company information that lockyer subpoenaed feb one five the power companies say they are not receiving assurances the documents lockyer wants will be kept confidential lockyer said he hopes to complete his spadework on the generators this summer the puc also is probing whether generators timed maintenance and shutdowns to drive up prices on thursday puc president loretta lynch said investigators found patterns of plant shutdowns that created artificial shortages lockyer insisted that no one yet has sufficient evidence to win a civil or criminal suit but were probably further along than any other investigative effort generators say they are cooperating with the investigations except for worries about proprietary information becoming public and flatly reject the notion they have been gaming the market or acting in concert we naturally would take serious issue with some of those allegations said richard wheatley a spokesman for reliant energy in houston it doesnt compute because we all compete against each other we dont cooperate share information or anything of that nature its not only illegal but unethical to do so said chuck griffin a mirant corp spokesman any patterns would exist because of the rules they established long before mirant was in california a new investigation of the generators is being done also by the aptly named senate select committee to investigate price manipulation in the wholesale energy market it too is meeting resistance from generators in handing over documents they consider confidential discussions thus far in that regard have been disturbing and right now were at an impasse said sen joe dunn dsanta ana the committees chairman dunns committee can only gather facts and make recommendations on new laws if it uncovers some kind of anticompetitive activity not already covered by the law so far the federal energy regulatory commission is the only entity to impose any economic pain on generators after a probe of californias power market last summer the commission issued an order in december that created a mechanism by which generators would have to justify prices above a certain level determined by the commission in march the commission said generators had to justify one two four million in charges or reimburse the money it also reached an eight million settlement with aes southland and williams energy marketing trading over power plants that were supposed to be running but werent critics from gov gray davis down say that generators owe many millions more in refunds several other investigations are either under way or completed the puc is investigating whether the holding companies of pacific gas and electric southern california edison and sempra energy in san diego violated the requirement that the utility be their first spending priority the

writers byline christian berthelsen scott winokur body large power companies have driven up electricity prices in california by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages according to dozens of interviews with regulators lawyers and energy industry workers those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of muchneeded electricity the accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by the chronicle the california energy commission calculates that an average of one four nine nine zero megawatts of generating capacity nearly a third of the states total was unavailable each day in april because of plant shutdowns more than four times as much as a year ago such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as california enters another period of high demand the warm spring and summer months of may to september when electricity usage normally grows by a third loretta lynch president of the california public utilities commission said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns and the california independent system operator which manages the states power grid says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply but an extensive investigation by the chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these gaming tactics contributed to the plants deteriorating condition we suspected it said jim macintosh the manager of grid operations for the iso it was a sure factor in driving up prices such swings in unit output he said would only make sense in a scenario when theyre trying to game something otherwise why would they do that theyre tearing their units up unusual phone calls operators at a san bernardino county power plant owned by reliant energy inc say a complex plan to manipulate the california energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the companys headquarters in houston according to the accounts of three plant operators reliants operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease then increase output at the one zero four six megawatt etiwanda plant this happened as many as four or five times an hour each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose then came the phone call to ramp the units back up they would tell us what to do and we would do it said one of the men who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired afterward we would just sit there and watch the market change the workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of california power plants just as the states power crisis began in earnest the workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market it appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in houston rather than the reliability needs of the iso said carl wood a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agencys investigation into plant outages instead of being responsive to demands for reliability theyre responsive to demands for profitability corporate denial reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to game the california energy market they and other power companies including aes corp and a partnership between nrg energy inc and dynegy inc have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet californias needs while acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every one zero minutes company officials said it was done at the instructions of the iso to maintain supplydemand balance as a part of routinely doing business within california and the california market design we are required to do that said kevin frankeny an operations official with reliant when the iso issues dispatch orders they dispatch on a one zero minute basis it can go up and down many times within an hour frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which reliant schedulers in houston ordered dispatch changes without the iso directing them to do it first the iso refused to comment on operations at any specific facility but stephanie mccorkle an iso spokeswoman said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply and one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid managers iso was not calling reliant every one zero minutes for that said one of the operators not for an individual unit officials with the california attorney generals office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated one source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping if proved to have been done to drive up prices could violate the states unfair business practices laws invisible practice how could companies such as reliant tinker with output and not get caught one of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators when power companies bid on hourly contracts they agree to produce a certain amount of electricity over the given hour generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour by driving up the spot price they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required the plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their output measurement which was performed at the top of each hour by the iso then he said it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity rose in response to the reduced output by the time the iso measured again the output was back at the expected level another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down that if the price reached a satisfactory level generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right other times if the price was low output was brought down and kept down the same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in houston with some being more aggressive than others what they would do especially late at night is if the price tanked they would undergenerate an operator said then mysteriously the price would go up then if the schedule was at seven zero required megawatt hours of output theyd say go up to nine zero that would cause the price to tank and theyd say bring it down again rapid changes these fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as one zero to one five minutes the operators said but acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by southern california edison were more like eight zero minutes to avoid stressing the machinery one of the workers said moreover they were typically run at constant levels which also reduced wear and tear they were basically ramping up as fast as they can and then slamming the brakes on said one of the operators they were increasing the fatigue on the units iso officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming tactics including instituting a socalled one zero minute market rather than the hourly market so that it could be more easily detected when companies were withholding power but the iso says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in driving up energy prices a computer analysis by the chronicle of shutdown data over a recent three nine day period shows reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of plant shutdowns reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost among those companies plants owned by reliant aes mirant corp and duke energy inc accounted for more than half of the states unplanned shutdowns even though their generating capacity was no more than two five percent of the states total capacity from all sources reliant one of californias largest and most profitable outofstate generators reported three one nine shutdowns during the period in march and april it was followed by mirant corp of atlanta three one zero aes corp of arlington va two seven eight and duke energy north america of charlotte nc two six one reliants unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than five three zero zero zero megawatts over the four zero day period an average of one three six eight per day enough power for one four million homes for one hour its ormond beach plant in oxnard with one generating unit down for two six days accounted for more than three zero zero zero zero of those missed megawatts however an operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of legitimate equipment failures reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of repair they are old at four eight etiwanda is the oldest of reliants five california plants and the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand but the operators said the issue is not so clearcut one problem at etiwanda a tube leak had been present for about a month and was previously reported to management they said but it had not deteriorated much it was operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit offline because of the problem moreover at the time of the shutdown the iso had expressly asked reliant to keep the unit online the operators said richard wheatley a spokesman for reliant denied that any reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary maintenance ramping may be rampant sources say reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice a source familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained from aes alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations and an operator who has worked at the el segundo plant coowned by nrg and dynegy said the practice was used there although less frequently the scheduling calls came from dynegys trading floor in houston rather than nrg in minneapolis he said steve stengel a spokesman for dynegy said changes in output at el segundo were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day and denied the company was engaged in gaming the california market in a may two zero zero zero report the california energy commission cited reliants etiwanda plant as well as the alamitos and el segundo plants as some of the major beneficiaries of high realtime prices that spring one way to obtain those high prices the plant workers said was the simple method of demanding a skyhigh price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met on one occasion one operator said reliant ordered a unit at etiwanda to be shut off because the iso would not meet the price of one zero zero zero per megawatt hour even though the legal price cap at the time was seven five zero the operator said its our unit shut it off the source said email christian berthelsen at cberthelsensfchroniclecom and scott winokur at

conservation needs serious advocacy not lipservice there is no better place to boost energy savings than in california the cynosure of the power crisis the shortage has the potential to direct california toward power efficiency on an even greater scale generation transmission and pricing are all under the microscope already this state is a leader with the secondlowest per capita use of energy in the nation thanks to building and lighting guidelines pioneered over the last several decades california now has no choice but to stay out front appliances industrial and farming equipment transportation and building codes were revolutionized by the oil shortages of the one nine seven zero s the state drew up car manufacturing guidelines mandating alternative fuels to boost mileage and cut tailpipe smog jobs were created the efficiencies were partly dictated by price as consumer costs surged during the arab oil embargo and then the iranian revolution buyers wanted products with smaller energy appetites and manufacturers responded but government also played a major role the state set up rules to spur industry to squeeze more results out of less energy these directives worked a soda can is just as cold in a new refrigerator using a third of the juice of a seven zero s era model mandated insulation fluorescent lighting and weatherstripping pay off theres no sacrifice in comfort or performance amid the current power shortage this message is only partially sinking in for months sacramento has dithered through a debate that has rung up a six billion price tag the sum paid out by the state to buy power none of this money has gone to conservation this week higher rates were approved by state regulators to repay the enormous outlays in energy buys and also to send a price signal to users higher rates should be a strong impetus to conserve but bigger bills arent the total solution for one thing the rates were reworked to favor industrial users the same group that pushed the states disastrous deregulation plan that underlies the shortage for this group to receive special treatment is unconscionable at best the money buys time to get california through a blackoutprone summer up to a dozen new power plants are under construction with the hope that by next year supply will be in balance with daily demand plainly the state badly needs to find new power and its power infrastructure should be updated but the mad scramble for electrons risks missing out on a larger opportunity to devise rules require new equipment and encourage methods that conserve power a longterm initiative to buildin conservation is missing the bush energy plan does little on this score instead conservation is being treated tentatively gov gray davis has directed eight zero zero million toward nearly a dozen energysaving programs these include buybacks of inefficient refrigerators and air conditioners replacement of older agricultural water pumps and weatherizing upgrades for lowincome homes these are reasonable steps to soften an immediate crisis already the states energy use has dropped by seven tonine percent through public awareness of the power shortage but conservation needs a more vigorous push from davis and bush whats missing is longrange thinking a willingness to legislate changes and political courage consider the qualifying facilities or small independent power plants that feed into the states market for months these generators many using alternative methods such as wood waste wind or small gas turbines have been stiffed by cashpoor big utilities the small suppliers have largely shut down worsening the statewide shortage and crimping an industry competing with big generators davis should make every effort to restore the small producers to financial health another opportunity is technology for decades the homely electric meter has stayed pretty much the same measuring the monthly energy use of homes and businesses what if this caveman gizmo were modernized and could give users an hourbyhour picture of energy habits on a grander scale gas mileage needs rethinking the bush energy package steered attention to its subsidies for alternativefuel cars but ignored the biggest challenge plugging loopholes that allow suvs and light trucks to burn more gas than cars research and governmental directives have made vehicles safer and more thrifty to operate a continued push from washington could innovate even further if the president was genuinely concerned about conservation ending the energy crisis will likely take a batch of ingredients in predicting the future many analysts bank on a mix of solutions new power plants higher rates state bonds to spread out one three billion in power buys and finally conservation its a term that usually comes last but a longerange strategy needs devising that will enable californias homes factories and farms to conserve on power use the state has faced the

2000-11-06,"[""'steve.hall@enron.com'""]","[""'elizabeth.sager@enron.com'"", "" 'christian.yoder@enron.com'""]",How FERC's proposed order will affect Enron contracts,as a starting point for briefing mark i thought i would open the dialogue by listing the proposed remedies and my thoughts on whether each would impact enrons existing contracts keep in mind that fercs remedies for the california market are only proposals that may or may not be adopted below i have listed all of the proposed remedies with comments next to or below each proposed remedy one eliminating requirement that the california ious buysell into the cal px the ious will no longer be required to sell all generation into and buy all of their requirements from the px this will allow the ious to act as their own scheduling coordinator instead of using the px as a scheduling coordinator it is expected that the ious will enter into more bilateral contracts i cant think of how this would affect contacts but i would suggest that if the ious pull out of the px in a big way the px market will be more thinly tradedless liquid leading to more volatile prices at the px two penalty charge for load deviations greater than five of actual load if actual load deviates from its schedule by more than five the iso will impose a penalty charge of two times the isos real time energy cost for balancing energy twice the inc price we should review our contracts to determine if they allocate this penalty to the appropriate party three removal of the existing iso and px governing boards probably a good idea but i cant see how this will affect our contracts four interconnection procedures ferc has directed the iso to develop standard tariff provisions to facilitate the interconnection of new and existing generators seeking to increase the rated capacity of their facility in california will this affect any contracts that the origination group is working on because this proposed isos new tariff language has yet to be written i would suggest that its effect on contracts at this time is remote five long term suggestions the ferc also made the following suggestions one the iso and the load serving entities in california should develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply two consider alternatives to the singleprice auction three eliminate the balanced schedule requirement by intergrating px and iso dayahead demand and supply bids into one venue four develop lessintrusive market mitigation remedies ie no price caps five redesign the congestion management system six develop demand response programs that would allow loads to bid into the market offers to reduce demand and six conform the iso to the requirements of rtos under order eight eight eight and order two zero zero zero since these are suggestions and may never materialize i do not think we need to modify our contracts at this time in response to these proposed changes six refunds ferc has said that it will not order refunds for unjust and unreasonable rates for the period before october two two zero zero zero going forward ferc may order refunds for unjust and unreasonable rates for the period oct two two zero zero zero through october two two zero zero two should we put a provision in our confirms or contracts that would make counterparties waive their rights to assert that such prices were unjust and unreasonable for that transaction seven price caps ferc has proposed a one five zero soft price cap the market clearing price would be capped at one five zero but parties can submit higher bids if a higher bid is submitted that party would be required to submit transaction information to the iso or px detailing the generation cost and any legitimate opportunity cost i would echo the point below about any reviewing any contracts tied to index prices how will we provide the incremental generation cost since we are only the marketer we may have to contractually require parties to provide us the information this would also raise confidentiality issues christian yoder one one zero six two zero zero zero zero eight zero two am to steve c hallpdxectect cc subject usa factboxferc details changes

details of what ferc did today one question you need to think about is how their decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to californias spot market the way it reports the market clearing price will change fundamentally if prices over one five zero will be accepted but not used to clear the market for all bids so if we are using this as a reference price in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives forwarded by steven j keannaenron on one one zero one two zero zero zero zero three three nine pm ann m schmidt one one zero one two zero

service c reuters limited two zero zero zero washington nov one reuters the us federal energy regulatory commission on wednesday approved several actions to revamp californias power market over the next two years immediate changes include the following eliminate requirement that three utilities pacific gas electric san diego power and socal edison must sell all of their power to and buy all their power from the state power exchange px require market participants to schedule nine five percent of their transactions in the dayahead markets to reduce chronic underscheduling of load and generation and overreliance on the isos realtime imbalance market to meet supply ferc also proposed a penalty charge for scheduling deviations in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements temporary modification of the singleprice auction so bids above one five zero mwh cannot set the market clearing price paid to all bidders establish independent nonstakeholder governing boards for the california power exchange px and independent system operator iso create congestion management design proposal establish generation interconnection procedures explore alternatives to the single price auction by the iso and px develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply is available to meet load and reserve requirements ferc also approved changes to protect wholesale customers from unreasonable rates during the time it will take to adopt longerterm market remedies the following price mitigation measures will remain in effect until dec three one two zero zero two singleprice auctions for all sales in the iso and px markets at or below one five zero mwh the single price would be used for all load which clears below this amount in the auction if an auction does not clear below the one five zero mwh level suppliers who choose to bid above one five zero would be paid their price bid in other words the highest bid of the day if above one five zero per mwh would no longer be the clearing price paid by all sellers receiving above one five zero per mwh would be required to report their bids to ferc on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information to the agency the iso and px would be required to report monthly information on such bids allowing ferc to monitor competitive conditions and assure just and reasonable rates sellers would be subject to potential refund liability but no lower than their marginal or opportunity cost if ferc finds noncompetitive conditions the potential refund liability would extend the full two four months it would take to

cost centers for these accounts but we just want to offer the flexibility please review the attached file and forward me any changes you would like made you may only need to review the fields in yellow green i have already sent you a note regarding the no cc fields that are in red we are only entering the default cost centers for the accounts that had activity on your company codes in year two zero zero zero that is why there are a lot of empty fields you do not have to worry about we will continue to add and modify the cost center defaults on an as needed basis use this information to help you analyze the spreadsheet accounts in black the accounts in black were already cost elements and already had the default cost centers assigned accounts in blue the accounts in blue are the new cost elements if there was an existing default cost center for a company we have already assigned it to the new accounts in blue yellow we selected a default cost center from the values assigned to the default profit center for that company code green there was not a default profit center so we reviewed the cost centers on that company and selected the one we thought was most appropriate red this company code did not have any cost centers i have already asked you for these in a previous email if you make changes please move them to a spreadsheet by themselves or make them easy for us to
