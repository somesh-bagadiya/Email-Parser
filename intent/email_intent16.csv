by stacie babula houston nov two zero bloomberg enron corp shares and bonds dropped after the energy trader disclosed debts of nine one five billion due by two zero zero three suggesting a takeover by dynegy inc may not happen soon enough to save the company from bankruptcy shares of enron fell one one seven or one three percent to seven eight nine in late morning trading enrons six four percent notes due in july two zero zero six were bid at seven seven cents on one of face value and offered at eight one cents down more than three percent from yesterday traders said enron whose shares plunged nine zero percent this year as accounting errors led to earnings restatements a federal investigation and a management shakeup said it has less than two billion in cash or credit lines dynegy plans to complete its buyout by october and enron may have to ask its lenders to restructure payment schedules to survive this filing shows that enron is in a precarious financial situation said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade who rates enron shares hold and doesnt own them they have to stay afloat for the dynegy deal to go through and that now looks difficult dynegy agreed nov nine to buy enron in a transaction now valued at two five billion in stock and assumed debt the difference between dynegys offer for enron and the price of enron shares widened to more than four five percent from two nine percent yesterday bloomberg data show its become more clear that the chances of this deal going through arent nine zero percent but much closer to fiftyfifty said edward paik who helps manage the liberty utilities fund with one six million enron shares theres just so much information that is unknowable about enrons financial position he said sec filing last week enron chief operating officer greg whalley said the company has eight billion invested in noncore businesses including broadband and the dabhol power plant in india whalley said enron will sell those business to pay down debt enron expects to get billions from the sales whalley said without being more specific enron wouldnt comment on whether it could sell assets fast enough to keep current on its debts asset sales valued at about eight zero zero million are expected close by the end of this year the company said yesterday in its thirdquarter filing with the securities exchange commission most of the nine one five billion in debt is due before the end of the third quarter when the dynegy buyout is scheduled to close according to the sec filing dynegy and chevrontexaco corp which owns two six percent of dynegy may have to help enron win refinancing agreements with its lenders said kathleen vuchetich who helps manage the one four billion strong american utilities fund which is five percent dynegy shares i never dreamt the nine one five billion in debt due would be that large coming due all at once vuchetich said it calls into question their decision to schedule it that way in the first place enron yesterday reduced thirdquarter results by three cents a share bringing the periods loss to eight seven cents or six six four million according to the sec filing on nov eight enron lowered earnings back to one nine nine seven by five eight six million to reflect losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept off the books that included a thirdquarter reduction of one seven million a drop in enrons senior unsecured debt rating to bbb by standard poors on nov one two may force enron to pay off a six nine zero million note by nov two seven if it doesnt find collateral to guarantee the debt taken on by an affiliated partnership the company said in the filing without repayment or collateral investors in a partnership that owns brazilian naturalgas assets can begin to liquidate the partnerships assets enron said the company said its working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and take debt off its books its shares plunged this year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were being used to hide losses from failed investments chief executive officer kenneth lay said last month that buying back six two million shares from two such partnerships cost enron shareholders one two billion in lost equity fourth quarter making good on debt owed by its whitewing affiliated partnership may cut enrons fourthquarter earnings enron said enron is obligated to back whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock because enrons stock has plunged it may have to write down its assets by seven zero zero million the filing said chevrontexaco the secondlargest us oil company is providing two five billion in cash as part of the enron buyout it provided the first one five billion a week ago shares of chevrontexaco based in san francisco rose two five one to eight four four two in midmorning trading dynegy fell five zero cents to four three zero five dynegy and enron are both based in houston enrons lay admitted last week that failed investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to dynegy before the buyout was announced enron stock had fallen nine zero percent this year,11:56:40,"Yes

is trying his best to get on top of the ebs tasks we have given him however having said that and before having received his report below i was going to write you an email indicating that i am afraid we cannot continue to keep david in this role i just returned from tokyo office opening meetings etc there i saw sanjay who confirmed his imminent new role for ebs asia anthony duenner president ebs asia and bill white head of ebs asia trading david simply does not enjoy the confidence of his commercial clients in ebs and notwithstanding my comments above about the level of his effort i do not see turning this around his problem is not any single one thing but a cumulation of things which i list below but i think it is the totality that feeds the general view one he was probably only a decent fit with the old enron apachi when it was assetfocussed and he could use his diplomatic experience to open doors for projects even then he was never an enron person in terms of our culture and being isolated in singapore has probably not helped to get him inculcated in the company culture with ebs and enron asia taking a much more merchant business focus he just does not get it two chris hunt apachi and jim row exebs encoureaged him to developpursue origination leads ebs does not want him doing that and the assetfocussed stuff he keeps tossing the way of the enrgy groups is grating to them given that they simply see him as not getting the message that the company has moved away from assets three bill white tells me that he david has not performed well in a meeting it is a single data point but bill is also known to me from enron europe days and he is not a particularly critical person four david only exacerbates this by being insecure about his role and trying too hard to sell himself to the clientscustomers internally and they find this teidous five frankly though it is not the only source of davids problems i think he was illserved by donald lassere and xixi the associate who i am confident conducted what is know here as a whispering campaign ie he does not know what he is doing he is not an expert in the filed and generally acting like a pair of juveniles when it has come to any effort to bring a sense of stability and order to the clients eg dont know what i am supposed to be doing in any event i simply do not see much prospect of persuading the ebs people to give david a chance and i think i will be doing myself no favours with them by pushing it so either we find another role eg in in washington and i am nor sure they need someone with davids skill sets or we let david go your thoughts in terms of supporting ebs asia i think the new guy i hired here in london could do it quite capably but all of the biz is either in houston or i am told sanjay is contemplating a move to singapore so in eitheerr case my guy here can probably not be effective from the standpoint of being read into the business from where i am i would prefer to have someone in singapore or tokyo rather than houston but the people in houston may want someone closer to them i frankly think it is a mistake to try to build a business in asia from houston sanjay mentioned the guy who is his general counsel at dabhol power company and i will discretely check with jane wilson on her impressions but he will not be communications literatespecialised look forward

korea will go back to advance the work on overturning the adverse regulatory ruling to my mind this is exactly what a regulatory review should do identify regulatory risks before we go in hong kong we have identified somebody in ebs to do the system configuration report i am going to go up there to advance the tariff submission that is due before year end japan i need to get up there and get up to speed on what the consultant is doing on tariff and terms and conditions singapore i am reminding the lawyers to get a corporate entity selected so we can proceed with a license and tax incentive

the way they try to get you to call be sure you read this and pass it on to all your friends family and business associates so they dont get scammed this is a major scam dont respond to emails phone calls or web pages which tell you to call an eight zero nine phone number this is a very important issue of scam busters because it alerts you to a scam that is spreading extremely quickly this can easily cost you two four one zero zero zero zero or more and is difficult to avoid unless you are aware of it wed like to thank verizon for bringing this scam to our attention this scam has also been identified by the national fraud information center and is costing victims a lot of money there are lots of different permutations of this scam but heres how it works you will receive a message on your answering machine voice mail etc asking you to call a number beginning with the area code eight zero nine the reasons you are asked to call varies it can be to receive information about a family member who has been ill to tell you someone you know has been arrested died to let you know you have won a wonderful prize etc in each case you are told to call the eight zero nine number right away since there are so many new area codes these days people unknowingly return these calls if you call from the us you will apparently be charged two four two five zero zero per minute or you will get a long recorded message the point is they will try to keep you on the phone as long as possible to increase the charges unfortunately when you get your phone bill youll often be charged more than two four one zero zero zero zero why it works the eight zero nine area code number is located in the british virgin islands the bahamas the eight zero nine area code can be used as a paypercall number similar to nine zero zero numbers in the us since eight zero nine is not in the us it is not covered by us regulations of nine zero zero numbers which require that you be notified and warned of charges and rates involved when you call a paypercall number there is also no requirement that the company provide a time period during which you may terminate the call without being charged furthermore whereas many us phones have nine zero zero number blocking to avoid these kinds of charges nine zero zero number blocking will not prevent calls to the eight zero nine area code we recommend that no matter how you get the message if you are asked to call a number with an eight zero nine area code that you dont recognize andorinvestigate further and just disregard the message be wary of email or calls asking you to call an eight zero nine area code num ber its important to prevent becoming a victim of this scam since trying to fight the charges afterwards can become a real nightmare thats because you did actually make the call if you complain both your local phone company and your long distance carrier will not want to get involved they will most likely tell you that they are simply providing the billing for the foreign company youll end up dealing with a foreign company that argues they have done nothing wrong please forward this entire message to all of your friends family and colleagues to help them become aware of this scam __________________________________________________ do you yahoo get email alerts new webcam video instant messaging with yahoo

inc washington dow jones california officials have shown bald disregard for federal energy regulatory commission authority and are pursuing shortsighted policies that will push the states two largest utilities over the brink and into bankruptcy ferc chairman james hoecker said thursday the remarks by hoecker who resigned as chairman effective thursday came in a highly unusual formal opinion in what represents his blistering last words on the rapidly unraveling power crisis in california hoecker lambasted gov gray davis and state policymakers for allowing the states power crisis to finally succumb to rolling blackouts state officials ignored the commissions dec one five marketrestructuring order and instead embraced conspiracy theories resistance to more realistic rates and calls for palliative price capsto obscure the issues and delay solutions hoecker said white housebrokered negotiations to develop powersupply contracts as part of a nearterm solution are at an impasse due to unrealistic demands by gov davis that power providers agree to contracts at rates below their cost of production hoecker said he further called for davis and lawmakers to relent in their unrealistic position that retail rates continue to be frozen at belowpresentcost preone nine nine six levels unless state officials agree to pursue realistic policies edison internationals southern california edison co eix and pge corps pacific gas electric co pcg will be pushed into bankruptcy by following the states flawed marketrestructuring law hoecker said perhaps bankruptcy can be averted if it cannot perhaps it will force debtors creditors and state officials to address the financial problems of utilities in a new light without recrimination and posturing he said lets be realistic hoecker said wall street and consumers share one critical trait without a reasonable technically defensible and comprehensive set of solutions to such crises they have no basis for confidence that problems can or will be managed or confidence to support investment on one hand and political forbearance on the other hoecker called for state officials to expeditiously implement the provisions of fercs dec one five order in particular he said the california power exchange is making the financial situation worse by ignoring the orders provision calling for suspension of the singleprice auction when prices bid exceed one five zero per megawatthour prices above the level allowed in the dec one five order have further jeopardized the financial status of california utilities he said reaching a deal on forward contracts as called for in fercs order is essential hoecker said an arbitrary bottomline solution cannot be prescribed without regard to costs he said but hoecker reserved perhaps his harshest criticism for the states first legislative response to the crisis which davis signed into law thursday to replace the california independent system operators industryparticipant governing board with a board of political state appointees such mixing of markets and politics on the iso a fercjurisdictional entity represents an unacceptable intrusioninto federally regulated power markets hoecker said further he said ferc made mistakes in allowing ab one eight nine zero the states electricity restructuring law to usurp the commissions regulatory authority over wholesale power markets in the first place because the state is now clearly a market participant the independence of the iso board is bound to be compromised consequently the states decisions are no longer entitled to the kind of deference we have accorded it since ab one eight nine zero hoecker said more than that this action evinces a bald disregard for federal jurisdiction and a rejection of cooperative solutions called for in fercs dec one five restructuring order hoecker said i recommend that the commission seek to enjoin this technically flawed and unlawful usurpation of its authority hoecker rejected the states continuing call for firm price caps in the region price caps will only jeopardize reliability mask problems temporarily and deter or destroy any chance to solve the longterm supply challenge he said hoecker urged an urgent response by policymakers regardless of whether the utilities enter bankruptcy we cannotkeep moving from one failure to the next with no agreedupon objectives the governors stated plans are unrealistic and ours cannot be fully implemented without his help hoecker concluded i urge state policymakers to reject the false illusion that going it alone will serve the interests

governor davis to trade political fingerpointing for solutions houstonbusiness wiremay one seven two zero zero one reliant energy strongly disagrees with california governor gray davis recent characterization of the company as being obstructionist and opposing court orders reliant energy believes that these accusations are politically motivated attempts to demonize reliant energy as an outsider responsible for causing the states energy crisis the accusations are simply not based on fact more importantly the governors attacks have done nothing to increase the states supply of electricity or prevent the blackouts expected this summer if anything the comments have fostered an atmosphere of distrust and uncertainty that have further destabilized the market reliant hopes the governor and others will stop these baseless accusations and focus on true solutions to californias energy shortage said joe bob perkins president and chief operating officer reliant energy wholesale group we are now being singled out because we believe in an open market not government control of power generation and we have offered solutions that do not jibe with the governors political agenda contrary to the perception governor davis is attempting to promote we have been focused on providing solutions that are fair to all parties in california since the outset of this crisis in fact earlier this week we provided the governors office with an outline of a series of emergency measures that if pursued quickly could help mitigate the power crisis this summer we are still waiting on a response perkins pointed out many of the steps reliant energy has taken to keep the lights on in california disputing the accusation of being obstructionist reliant energy has run its three zero tofive zero yearold plants at the highest levels since their purchase in one nine nine eight in two zero zero zero reliant nearly doubled the output from these plants to meet the needs of californians running them at levels far exceeding the prior owner southern california edison reliant energy invested eight zero million dollars in two zero zero zero alone to upgrade plants to make sure the most power possible is available during peak times in addition the company improved emissions levels to clean up the environment and keep costs for emission credits to a minimum for the last two years reliant has encouraged the investor owned utilities and the state to invest in longterm contracts to stabilize rates instead of relying on the spot market in particular reliant energy offered to sell power at two cents per kilowatthour if the buyer would purchase the natural gas required to generate the power ensuring a transparent cost of power reliant energy has never shut down generation despite the prevalent concerns that continue to exist over credit issues in contrast just last week a major outofstate supplier refused to continue to sell to california unless payment was forthcoming reliant energy has created an aggressive curtailment plan to encourage businesses to sell back power voluntarily to add more power to the western power grid the company has met with many leaders in western states to introduce the program yet california officials will not even engage in a dialogue on the program we welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues oneonone with the governor perkins said unfortunately he has repeatedly refused this request over the past year last weeks meeting with generators was the first time the group was allowed to speak with him directly and obviously the purpose of that meeting was political grandstanding perkins added that the governors accusations of opposing court orders are unfounded we have always worked within the law and are proud of our commitment to keeping the lights on we have followed all court orders and worked closely with the ferc and others to cooperate fully with all investigations when necessary we have filed court

johnsonhoueesees harry kingerski subject draft testimony re pgesce for discussion harry and i are meeting tomorrow i would like any feedback you have related to the following based on our position we would prefer later surcharges lower surcharges surcharges that are lower in the summer flatter is better because it is closer the npv effects and our rapidly diminishing position the proposal below could either result in delay of a month while they consider this complicated affair low likelihood lower surcharge if we can convince people that market rates are three zero zero mwh for a year when they are actually two zero zero we would only get a two zero mwh increase as compared to a three zero mwh increase ie one nine zero times three zero zero mwh yields three zero mwh is our story when the actural is one nine zero times two zero zero mwh yields two zero mwh the enron rates below are effectively much flatter than the cpuc proposal thus we would be better off if accepted additionally if our noise causes a flat three zero mwh increase to replace the cpuc proposal we are better off additionally we could sell hedging on the one zero exposed to markets dsm related to capital investments should be less risky the risks to enron are proposal makes it easy to hit the large customers with a lower baseline ie seven five instead of nine zero would make dsm more risky dsm

stonesshouees on zero four zero two two zero zero one zero nine two two pm scott stoness zero four zero two two zero zero one zero nine two one pm to tamara johnsonhoueesees cc harry kingerski subject draft testimony re pgesce for discussion summary the cpuc should implement two part rtptou rates for pgesce a two part rate is a rate where customers pay their historical rate for consumption of normal load and pay market value for consumption incremental or decremental to normal load the cpuc should define normal consumption as consumption over and above nine zero of historical two zero zero zero consumption the cpuc should define the hourly rate as the highest hourly price paid by dwr for spot purchases in that hour in the event that implementation of two part rtptou rates is complicated to design the three zero mwh surcharge should be applied to all customers until the implementation of two part rtptou rates is possible the current draft design of the cpuc is discriminatory to large customers the current draft design of the cpuc does not provide appropriate price signals the current draft design of the cpuc results in rate increases to large customers that are unneccessarly high the current draft design of the cpuc results in rate increases to large customers that are far in excess of those which the cpuc intended the current draft design of the cpuc results is static and does not respond to changing market conditions design goals the cpuc should design rates that give appropriate price signals to customers to consume conserve energy as as close to marginal price as possible in as many hours as possible treat all rate classes in a fair and consistent manner achieve targeted revenue requirements are easy to administer and understand summary of cpuc illustrative design the cpuc has proposed rates that move on peak pricing in the summer close to marginal rates draft proposal provides marginal price signal of about three seven zero mwh for eone nine secondary from in summer weekdays from noon to six pm draft proposal provides marginal price signal of about seven five mwh for eone nine secondary from in all other hours critique based on design goals draft proposals move toward marginal rates but fall short the rates for power mar three zero two zero zero one based on djnpone five on peak is one eight one nine four mwh the rates for power mar three zero two zero zero one based on djnpone five off peak is nine three four six mwh the proposed marginal rates for eone nine secondary is seven five mwh for on peak and off peak this rate design will not encourage investments in assets that result in lower consumption in the winter or in off peak periods draft proposal falls short on treating customers on a consistent basis etwo zero transmission voltage customers will experience a eight seven rate increase eone nine secondary voltage customers will experience a four one rate increase aone zero medium general service customers will experience a two zero rate increase aone small lp customers will experience a one six rate increase the marginal price signal for aone zero will be one two one mwh vs three seven zero mwh for etwo zero transmission in the on peak summer the marginal price signal for eone zero wills be one zero seven mwh vs five five mwh for etwo zero transmission in the off peak periods pge has a longer summer period than sce this results in a six nine increase for sce toueight sub as compared to eight seven increases for pge etwo zero transmission rate the proposal also results in far different marginal price signals for sce customers than pge customers for example the on peak rate for sce toueight sub is one two eight mwh as compared to pge etwo zero transmission rate of three seven four mwh draft proposal does do a good job of recovering two two b of revenue draft proposal require some implementation but given that the surcharge increase does not ocur until may for pge and june for sce it should be possible to implement enron proposed rates enron proposes two part real time pricing time of use rate usage up to nine zero of historical use would be billed at historical rates usage incremental or decremental to nine zero of historical use would be billed at djnpone five on peak and djnpone five off peak where customers has real time metering usage incremental or decremental to nine zero of historical use would be billed at djnpone five on peak and djnpone five off peak averaged over the month where customers has time of use metering usage incremental or decremental to nine zero of historical use would be billed at four five of djnpone five on peak and five five of djnpone five off peak averaged over the month where customers has just energy metering critique based on design goals enron proposals charge all customer at very close to marginal rates thus within the constraints of using dow jones the rates should be very close to the actual marginal rates the rates will not be exact because they are determined on the previous day ony differentiate between on and off peak as compared to hour by hour to the extent that the customer does not have real time metering capability the rates will be determined on a class average basis however the rates be far superior to the cpuc draft design because they give better price signals to night consumption they give better signals to weekend consumption they give better signals to winter consumption they are self correcting in that they do not require predetermination of marginal costs for example if summer costs are lower the rate will be lower the enron proposal will motivate dsm activities in winter summer and off peak enron proposal results in similar rate structure and impact regardless of utility and rate class the enron proposal results in a similar concept for commerical and industrial as with residential abone x provides that residential customers that consume energy below normal rates will not have increased rates this design also achieves the same effect for commercial and industrial customers draft proposal does do a good job of recovering two two b of revenue but even more importantly it ensures tracking of costs setting the normal load at nine zero of historical load results in a three zero mwh increase if the market value for the entire year is three zero zero mwh in the event that the market value for the entire year is less than three zero zero mwh the resulting cost decreases will offset the lost revenue the enron proposed rate design structure is flexi ble enough that it can easily be changed to achieve greater or lessor revenue to achieve price signals and revenue targets the revenue outcome is less certain than the cpuc draft design however the impact should be more certain because the revenue will automatically go up when the costs go up draft proposal require greater implementation details than the cpuc design but such extra costs are worthwhile the enron proposal requires determination of historical loads for large customers determination of class consumption profiles for demand metered customers determination of class consumption profiles for energy metered customers determination of customer profiles in the event that the customers is a new customer then enron proposal has the following negatives some customers who have reduced load from historical levels will be better off even though they have not changed their behaviour in response to the new price signals the rates will require greater administrative costs since they are different for each customer the rates may take more work to put in place for the utility the rates will result in similar customers paying dissimilar rates depending upon the historical consumption of the customers q in the event that it is not possible to implement the enron rates by june one two zero zero one what would you propose a an interim solution a the cpuc draft rates are so flawed that it would be superior to just implement a flat three zero mwh surcharge to all customers this approach would be fairer and simpler q who would pay for the decremental consumption of customers a the dwr will incur a decline in their costs equal to the decrease in rates of the utilities the are indifferent to buy more generation or selling less energy to customers thus the dwr should be willing to pay for decremental consumption in the event that the dwr is not agreeable to paying for decremental consumption the utility should be allowed to borrow such funds and have the costs amortized for the next one zero years in the event that the utility is unable to fund decremental consumption the normal load could be defined eight five of historical and the cpuc could eliminate credits resulting from decremental consumption such solution would discourage conservation below one five but would not be expected to diminish the effectiveness of the enron proposed rates q why is djnpone five the right index to choose a djnpone five and djspone five are availble for each weekday for on and off peak pricing the index is a mathematical average of trades in the previous day for today the dj index is compiled based on the information provided by many of the large trading companies including enron the numbers provided by the participants are subject to audit thus dj is the best avaible information available for energy pricing q what index is suitable for weekends a enron proposes that the average djnpone five off peak energy charges for friday and monday be used to determine the weekend rates for the purpose of rate setting,00:40:00,No

committee tax cuts are the best stimulus by r glenn hubbard washington post friday november one six two zero zero one page afour seven with most indicators of economic production such as employment and purchasing showing further decline in october some have argued that president bushs growth plan would have little stimulative effect they prefer the senate democrats plan on the grounds that spending is a better way to revive the economy permit me to differ the presidents plan included in the stimulus plan passed by the house addresses the nations underlying economic problems if enacted the tax cuts will quickly deliver a boost to move the economy back toward its longrun growth path the plan it is estimated would result in three zero zero zero zero zero more jobs and add half a percentage point to the two zero zero two growth rate heres how tax cuts help stimulate the economy tax cuts for individuals give them more money to spend and invest tax cuts for business for three years long enough to have a serious effect would make investment less expensive so businesses would be encouraged to buy equipment increase production and expand employment it is a major fallacy to praise new spending plans as stimulus this ignores the fact that a dollar spent by the government is one fewer that can be spent by private businesses furthermore new spending programs almost never go away and they lead to more inflexible regulation of the economy new spending programs are not only unlikely to make the economy grow they also are an undesirable response to terrorism risks instead it is important to take advantage of the flexibility and innovation of the private sector this will reduce the negative effects on job growth as part of our necessary response to terrorism the real underlying economic problem is that the terrorist attacks took a direct toll on the economy and more important on the confidence of american households and firms the combined effect tipped a fragile rate of economic growth into negative territory but the attacks did not undermine longterm productivity growth so economic fundamentals remain strong the challenge is simply to restore the health of the economy quickly and congress needs to do so in the way that will be most beneficial assistance for dislocated workers is important and the president has already proposed an aggressive package to provide it but spending should not be confused with economic stimulus the basic source of uncertainty and loss of consumer confidence is fear over job loss and the fact is that additional spending even on unemployment insurance wont give people jobs indeed the excessive expansion of unemployment insurance proposed by the senate would actually increase unemployment because it would discourage job applicants from accepting new positions moreover the senate bill would err by raising taxes on employers exactly the wrong thing to do at this moment until one addresses the underlying source of the uncertainty there will be no guarantee that hemorrhaging federal dollars will do any good lower tax rates are the best way to create jobs and make large and small businesses grow acceleration of future tax cuts which congress has already chosen will help the economy despite the repeated claim that only poor households will spend additional income evidence indicates almost all households spend about the same percentage of their tax cuts business tax relief is essential because it encourages firms to expand investment and employment with tax cuts firms would be able to replace existing machines with more productive ones precisely the kind of change that frees up funds to hire more workers the economy needs help now the president wants to create more jobs while the senate proposes new entitlements if you were unemployed which would you prefer the writer is chairman of the presidents council of economic advisers reprinted by permission of the author paid for by the republican

pge filed for bankruptcy alternative plant owners who hadnt been paid in months pursued court actions byline julie tamaki times staff writer dateline sacramento body in filing for federal bankruptcy protection last week pacific gas electric co determined what other power producers had already concluded the state had failed to solve their payment problems and the time had come for the courts to step in in the days leading up to pges bankruptcy court petition a growing number of alternative energy producers had also been filing lawsuits seeking to be freed from their contracts with pge and southern california edison the litigation was triggered in part by a controversial new rate plan imposed last month by the state public utilities commission in addition to millions of dollars of debt owed to the producers by the utilities on tuesday dynamis inc filed suit in fresno saying pge owes it three million carsonbased watson cogeneration co one of the states largest alternative energy producers also had filed suit to have its contract with edison suspended so did delta power which owns five small gasfired plants in california both producers are owed tens of millions by edison at least a dozen such suits have been filed in civil courts and lawyers warn that more could be on the way tough solutions were not being brought to the equation which left pge and others feeling they were better off in the court system said jerry bloom an attorney for the california cogeneration council the court actions come on the heels of an order by the puc last month that edison and pge begin fully paying hundreds of small alternative energy producers but some producers say that a new rate plan issued by the puc would force them to operate at a loss and that nothing has been done to address the about one five billion owed to members of the group by pge and edison lawyers say other producers have served edison with notices that they plan to cancel their contracts gasfired generators account for about twothirds of the electricity produced by the alternative energy group the california independent system operator keeper of the states power grid reports that there continues to be a roughly three zero zero zero megawatt reduction in output from the alternative energy producers the daily sum is enough power to supply two million to three million typical homes it clearly shows the problem hasnt been fixed said jan smutnyjones executive director of the independent energy producers california is home to nearly seven zero zero producers of alternative and renewable energy which as a group provide more than a quarter of the electricity used by consumers some of the producers have gone offline or reduced supplies for maintenance reasons but others have cut back because they have not been paid by edison since november or have received only partial payments from pge the drop in output has at times forced the state to purchase replacement supplies on the pricey spot market for electricity and contributed to rolling blackouts last month the latter event prompted gov gray davis to propose a plan to get the generators up and running again consequently the puc established a new rate plan for the producers and ordered the utilities to begin fully paying them beginning this month the payment goal would be accomplished in part by slashing the rates that pge and edison must pay the producers but the puc action appears to have compelled a growing number of gasfired generators to file lawsuits in an effort to be released from their contracts with the utilities and be paid the millions they are owed bloom contends that the new rate plan will force some producers to operate at a loss because it does not adequately compensate for their gas expenses he said he expects generators to challenge the plan in court or before the federal energy regulatory commission smutnyjones contends that the plan wrongly assumes that all natural gas used by his members can be piped in from the oregon border where the price of natural gas is cheaper the producers he added are seeking assurances that they will be paid realistic rates by the utilities for future deliveries utilities are scheduled to pay the first round of reduced rates as ordered by the puc early next week both utilities have indicated that they plan to make the first round of payments edison officials said friday they have been served with one zero producer lawsuits they say they fear that if the generators are let out of their contracts they could sell their supplies out of state which could in turn cause rates to rise for california consumers because it would reduce supply pge spokesman john nelson said in an interview last week before the bankruptcy filing that pge has been served with two such lawsuits he said his company is also concerned about the puc rate plan and whether it truly lowered the rates pge must pay the alternative producers and whether there would be enough money in the rates paid by customers to turn around and pay the producers were concerned that the commission decision does not solve the problem nelson said a davis spokesman said last week that the administration is still working on the issue of money owed to the producers and that the administration is continuing to work with the puc to get more generators back online observers believe the number of producer lawsuits will grow because most cases to date have been aimed at edison the utility has not paid its producers since november and has fought to have its rates slashed by comparison pge has made efforts to partially pay its producers in recent months and to keep them informed of their financial situation a bankruptcy court is expected to decide whether to affirm the contracts of producers who sell to pge or to free them to sell their power elsewhere an imperial county judge has already freed calenergy a small geothermal producer from its contract with edison because of edisons failure to pay the company the court has delayed ruling on calenergys request for nine nine million in back payments until april one six the day the utility is expected to begin paying its alternative generators since it quit transmitting two seven zero megawatts to edison last month calenergy has been selling its electricity to el paso energy a marketing company that resells power on the spot market if other generators are able to repeat the pattern it could further reduce state energy supplies particularly this summer when every megawatt will be needed to

angeles april six body the pacific gas and electric company californias largest investorowned utility filed for bankruptcy protection today declaring that politicians and regulators had not moved quickly enough to resolve an energy crisis that has caused periodic rolling blackouts and is costing the state billions of dollars the filing which seeks reorganization under chapter one one of the bankruptcy code shifts decisionmaking about crucial aspects of the california energy debacle from officials in sacramento the state capital to a federal bankruptcy court in san francisco where pacific gas and electric has its headquarters the utility hopes to have more success in court in trying to win relief from nine billion in wholesale energy debt it says it has incurred since prices began soaring last may legislators and regulators have been loath to bail out pacific gas and electric or the no two utility southern california edison whose billions in debt to wholesalers and marketers stem from flawed state deregulation that did not allow the utilities to pass on rising costs to consumers the filing came as a surprise to many particularly gov gray davis who in a televised speech only thursday night reversed his stand against electricity rate increases acknowledging that consumers would have to pay more for months the two utilities had complained that they were running out of cash and had demanded that rates be increased to cover their costs but they had not made good on any threat to file for bankruptcy the reason in part was that the governors office in trying to forestall a greater sense of uncertainty surrounding the energy crisis was negotiating to keep the utilities solvent by buying their transmission lines on tuesday executives from pacific gas and electric met for four hours with the governors negotiators on thursday wall street analysts said they had been told by the governors representatives that there were hopes some resolution could be reached that night the governor proposed a plan with rate increases a centerpiece that he said would help pay off the utilities debts in the end none of this was enough for pacific gas and electric in a conference call with reporters today robert d glynn jr chairman of the utility and of its parent company the pge corporation said the governor was not moving fast enough having delayed a facetoface meeting for weeks weve heard a lot of the words that have been involved but we have not seen a lot of actions mr glynn said the regulatory and political processes have failed us and now we are turning to the court mr glynn said the bankruptcy filing would not affect customer service and he said it involves only pacific gas and electric which operates in northern and central california and not the parent company itself or its other units southern california edison meanwhile said today that it would continue to try to reach an agreement with the governor responding to the announcement by pacific gas and electric governor davis said the company had dishonored itself this action was unnecessary he said theyve caused undue alarm pge was not pushed into bankruptcy but plunged themselves into bankruptcy for their own strategic advantage not the best interests of the people of california a few months ago in a move widely criticized by consumer groups and legislators the pge corporation took steps to ensure that the assets of its other subsidiaries would not be seized in case of a pacific gas bankruptcy just this week the state public utilities commission said it would investigate whether pacific gas and electric southern california edison and the states no three investorowned utility san diego gas and electric had engaged in any financial misconduct by funneling billions to their parent companies to pay dividends and repurchase stock trading in pge stock was halted briefly today when it resumed the price quickly fell by nearly four zero percent by days end the stock of edison international parent of southern california edison had also dropped sharply by three five percent that pacific gas and electric which helped design the deregulation that brought on the california power crisis would now take so drastic a step both concerned and puzzled analysts it doesnt make sense because the governor endorsed the rate increase the utilities had been asking for said susan abbott head of the power group at moodys investors service in new york but ms abbott also noted that the rate increases varying from one zero percent to three seven percent on top of a nine percent surcharge adopted by the state this winter would not entirely eliminate the debt accumulated by the utilities as a result of deregulation there were a lot of people who said great the utilities problems are over she said but they are not the bankruptcy petition filed by pacific gas and electric reported assets of two four billion and debts of one eight billion in his talk with reporters mr glynn said the company was still incurring three zero zero million in monthly wholesale energy costs that it had no way of paying but his biggest concern aside from the stalled negotiations with the governor is the public utilities commission for instance mr glynn complained about the commissions recent change to the utilities accounting practices a step he said would make it even more difficult for pacific gas to recoup any losses the commission has also said it is the state which has had to step in as a middleman buying power for the utilities because many suppliers have cut off their credit that will be the first to be paid money flowing from the rise in consumer rates in any event moving into the bankruptcy court the debate over debt that has already been incurred should resolve a question that the parties to the issue have been unable to settle who indeed will get paid first analysts say the bankruptcy judge dennis montali will have to consider several issues in particular that electricity is a vital necessity that being the case it is likely that the power generators which have been called price gougers and pirates but have supplied the state with enough energy to keep the lights on will have priority among the creditors that is good news for many of the states smaller generators many of which were forced to shut their doors when pacific gas and electric made only partial payments to them after that analysts say bondholders will most likely be next in line although all this will await a judgment by the court which among other things must also decide what priority the state enjoys its going to help focus in a very specific objective order the manner in which their financial situation gets sorted out said jan smutnyjones executive director of the independent energy producers association which represents power generators in the state the thing to do when you get in a hole is stop digging they did that today httpwwwnytimescom graphic photo a

and on friday it reinforced that ruling saying the iso misinterpreted its earlier decision and must comply the ruling could increase pressure to find creative solutions to who will pay for californias power said jan smutnyjones head of the independent energy producers association obviously the iso doesnt have the money and the utilities dont have the money either the question is where do we go from here he said my hope is that it does not make blackouts more likely the state hasnt decided whether it will appeal the decision said roger salazar a spokesman for gov gray davis but he said the

debt but it wont solve power crisis byline by brandon bailey body san jose calif _ filing for bankruptcy protection may help pge with its debts but it wont solve the states power crunch power suppliers promised friday that they will continue to deliver electricity for california consumers which means the lights will stay on for now but experts and industry spokesmen say that supply wont be enough to prevent the shortages and rolling blackouts that state officials have predicted for this spring and summer the summer crisis will still happen said bill highlander of calpine corp a san josebased energy producer its a matter of supply and demand in addition many experts agreed friday that pacific gas electric cos bankruptcy filing could have little immediate impact on other problems that are plaguing the states power system soaring wholesale prices congested transmission lines and aging generating plants but some said the action eventually could lead to more rate increases for consumers beyond those proposed by gov gray davis and the state public utilities commission in recent weeks the reason lies in the fact that a bankrupty judge doesnt have a magic wand the court can make sure suppliers fulfill their existing contracts by guaranteeing that they will be paid for future deliveries placing them ahead of creditors who are only seeking payment for past debts a judge may be able to order pges customers to pay higher rates _ or at least the court can put pressure on state regulators to authorize rate hikes but a judge cant order pges suppliers to build new power plants or speed up expansion of existing generators analysts also said they dont believe a judge has the authority to limit wholesale prices on the spot market where much of the states energy is still bought and sold pge has said its been unable to pay its suppliers because it has a multibilliondollar deficit from buying power at wholesale prices that the state wont allow it to pass on to consumers instead the state of california has been buying power for pge and southern california edison while attempting to negotiate a bailout for both utilities some industry spokesmen expressed hope that the bankruptcy filing would give pge suppliers more assurance about getting paid in the future _ and prevent the states energy markets from careening further out of control still other analysts warned that if the filing delays payment to smaller power generators who provide up to a third of the states supply it could drive more of them out of the market i just dont see any upside to this at all said peter navarro a professor of economics and public policy at university of californiairvine who has closely followed the effects of deregulation on the states energy industry spokesmen for some of the states largest generators including calpine duke energy and dynegy inc said pges action would have no effect on their operations it really shouldnt have any effect on our putting output into the grid said tom williams of duke energy which owns three power plants in northern california in large part that is because these companies have not been selling directly to pge for several months since the utility began developing financial problems last fall several major suppliers said they have been negotiating contracts with other buyers dynegy for example has committed its output in contracts with the state of california duke has agreements with other wholesale energy buyers and traders if the bankruptcy filing allows pge to reorganize its debts and eventually reenter the energy market on a more stable footing steve stengel of dynegy said todays action could actually be a catalyst to moving forward toward a longterm solution but a number of small generators have already shut down their plants because pge and southern california edison the states other major utility havent paid for past deliveries that has kept about three zero zero zero megawatts offline and contributed to shortages that caused the states independent system operator to declare power alerts on several days last month as the weather gets warmer the independent system operator has warned that shortages will get worse and the prospects for bringing those small generators back online are uncertain some of those small producers have said they may have to file for bankruptcy protection themselves one spokesman said companies that are currently operating their plants will continue in operation for at least three zero days until they see what the bankruptcy court will do but if the court doesnt authorize a plan for paying those companies what they are owed both for past deliveries and future energy production jan smutnyjones of the independent energy producers association warned some small firms may ask the court to excuse them from their contracts with pge that could allow the small producers to sell their electricity on the spot market where prices are generally higher than what the generators were promised in their utility contracts smutnyjones added that could leave the state buying even more power at higher prices while the state has been buying most of the power delivered to utility customers the independent system operator has continued to make some spotmarket purchases directly on behalf of the utilities the iso makes those lastminute purchases to meet the states electricity needs when the state has been unable to purchase enough power in advance in a separate development friday federal authorities ruled that generators cannot be forced to sell power to the iso if there is no guarantee of payment and some analysts suggested that pges bankruptcy filing may jeopardize the isos ability to make lastminute purchases on the utilitys behalf a spokesman for gov gray davis however told the associated press that the state may simply step in to guarantee payment on those transactions and an iso spokeswoman said her agency is confident it will be able to continue those transactions but few experts held out hope friday that a bankruptcy court would order suppliers to reduce their prices which have soared in recent months while the court might force suppliers to accept a reduction in payment for past deliveries i dont think its going to be able to affect prices going into the future said consumer group attorney mike florio who sits on the iso governing board as for the prices that individual consumers pay many suppliers have argued along with pge that the utility needs to be able to raise its retail rates even more than already proposed while consumer advocates contend that any rate increases are unjustified industry analysts said they are hopeful a judge will be convinced otherwise i think the longterm result will be that rates will increase more

thirdlargest corporate bankruptcy ever second industry experts say that any rate increases included in the utilitys reorganization plan would have to be approved by the california public utilities commission the times adds the judge will have to sort out which creditors get paid first most analysts think that the power generators will be first in line but whether the money from any rate increases will be funneled to the state which has been buying electricity on behalf of the troubled utilities or to the utilities will be hotly debated in court if the bankruptcy judge decides to side with utilities that could jeopardize the states already tenuous plan to issue as much as one four billion in revenue bonds which would be used to help cover the states energy spending the times also reports whatever the outcome pacific gas and electric will not be able to escape what it seems to be trying to avoid a political solution governor davis and regulators will still play a role in resolving the broader energy crisis here despite critics who say they have failed miserably thus far the judge too will have to negotiate over rate increases with the public utilities commission which will be keeping more than a watchful eye on the proceedings when a plan is adopted publicity aside california still pays less for power than several states the los angeles times four nine slater reports for all its energy notoriety and outrage over surging electricity rates california has plenty of company much of the nation faces doubledigit price hikes and several states especially in the east continue to pay more for electricity than california overshadowed by the rhetoric lawsuits and rolling blackouts is the fact that californians have been paying less for electricity than residents in rhode island new hampshire vermont new york alaska and by a longshot hawaii california in fact is barely in the top one zero when it comes to electrical prices the times adds one of the reasons that californians have been paying less is because they conserve more with the average resident draining four zero less from the grid than the average american another reason however is that

has already spent about dollars four bn on power costs longerterm bond proceeds would pay off the shortterm loan jp morgan chase which has been named lead underwriter of the power debt previously said it could arrange a dollars three bn bridge loan until the bonds could be sold its an interesting financing plan mr gordon said of the states proposal remaining questions over the revenue stream to support the bonds leave the market unclear whether the debt would be considered privateactivity bonds or bonds to be backed by money from the general fund which can determine their credit ratings and essentially the interest owed bondholders mr gordon said among other things the cpuc must determine what part of recent consumer rate increases will go to the state and how much of any revenue stream from consumer bills would go to servicing debt on the bonds the panel said mr kelleher said the pending deal compares to the unprecedented bond sale by the long island power authority a few years ago

competitive pricing is suddenly taking off how far the sector will fly is another matter three socalled stranded cost securitizations have come to market this year raising the total issued to six billion the latest a one four billion deal from connecticut light and power that closed one zero days ago added vital liquidity to a market in which just one bond offering priced last year the connecticut deal came on the heels of a benchmark two five billion transaction from public service electric and gas and a one seven billion securization from detroit edison stranded cost securitizations first emerged in the midone nine nine zero s as a way for utilities to recoup their losses on unprofitable assets or investments in order to prepare them for deregulation to recoup those losses some utilities are requesting the right to force customers or competitors to pay them off the cash flow from those payments is whats used to back the securities and pay off bondholders its not clear how much growth potential exists in the strandedcost market however consumer challenges have slowed the process in some states and californias woes may entice some states to resist deregulation altogether the example of california is a disincentive to restructure and has a chilling effect on elected officials as to the impact of changes in the electricity market says ellen lapson a managing director in the global power group at fitch other states arent sitting on unprofitable investments and so dont need to securitize them but the recent flurry of stranded cost securitizations should entice more investors to the sector making it worth their while doing the extensive research involved the sheer size of these deals creates natural liquidity says gordon sweely managing director in structured finance trading at lehman brothers more investors will look at the sector as a credit card substitute with added spread indeed the investor base for stranded rate securitizations is much the same as it is for credit card or autobacked transactions strandedcost buyers demand a slight premium based on the uniqueness of the asset this typically amounts to an extra five basis points for the shorter maturities and around one two bps for a one zero year deal in addition the investor gets a diversification play and the satisfaction of knowing that his or her investment is more secure than other abs issues thats because consumers need electricity the underlying receivables have a lower default rate than almost any other type of receivables we know of says fitchs lapson in addition the costs are spread across a large group of electricity consumers the securities which are structured so that they can receive a aaarating also are largely insulated from deteriorating credit conditions of the utility that issues them thats because consumers theoretically will be required to pay the costs regardless of what happens to the utility as a result ratingagency downgrades of californias two largest utilities have had no impact on the ratings of bonds in the sector and the rating agencies say that that such bonds should retain their aaastatus even in the event of a utility defaulting so far only one one of these deals have been issued and of those deals seven have been underwritten by two leading assetbacked playerssalomon smith barney and lehman brothers there is a tendency for ourselves and someone like salomon to be first with unique more heavily structured products said lehmans sweely these deals fall into that category the league table situation is unlikely to change while the future of the sector remains in question meanwhile the pipeline is still brimming with potential deals from states that have already ruled in favor of passing on such costs to consumers there remains a limit to the markets potential typically a visit to the stranded cost securitization market is a onetime event but in a few cases utilities make the trip more than once illinois power and commonwealth edison may return to market as did peco energy co in order to raise the remainder of the desired funds it appears that the recent flurry of activity was coincidental which means there may be no more deals for some time thats because in large part the pace of issuance depends on how long it takes the various states to give their seal of approval particularly if consumers mount a court challenge as has occurred in texas analysts estimate that the securitization of stranded costs for txu electric central power and light and reliant energy could have taken place as early as last april were it not for their cases slow progress past the state utility regulator the public service commission and through the courts while the texas utilities could

the power of eminent domain to recover the gasfired generation plants that the price manipulators are using to set monopoly prices he can pay just compensation to the owners but not one dime more the governor should now recognize californias vital interest in protecting itself from these prices eminent domain is a reasonable tool to use to achieve that goal it has been used in less compelling circumstances for example eminent domain was used in the early one nine eight zero s for george w bushs investment team to assemble the land on which the texas rangers stadium is built from which he and his partners profited handsomely if eminent domain can be used for private profit it can be used to protect the vital interests of the state of california the plants should be divested to private ownership but only to companies that are under puc jurisdiction the puc also should be used to plan how california can move forward to an improved costbased system of regulation what we cannot do is to continue on with the current plan which is to have the governor set electricity prices behind closed doors working with the very people who are suspected of unlawful price fixing pges bankruptcy provides the governor with a new opportunity to move to a more effective program the governor should now stop using public funds to buy electricity he should urge edison to join pge in reorganizing under bankruptcy court protection this will allow all parties to contest the unpaid billions of dollars of receivables owed to the power producers and their associates this will send a message to wall

pge southern california edison and san diego gas and electric to buy their transmission systems in exchange for state assistance with debts just thursday night davis had bowed in a television address to the necessity for big rate increases he no doubt meant to assure californians that he was taking strong action to solve the crisis and keep the utilities from bankruptcy but he disappointingly offered no new initiatives in the clearest possible slap at davis pge was at the steps of the bankruptcy court the next morning however embarrassed davis must have been by the sideswipe he should not allow anger to dictate his response he needs to demonstrate hes above such pettiness and perhaps even acknowledge that his snailspace progress was part of the problem davis redoubled efforts over the weekend to strike a deal with edison for its part of the transmission system but pges bankruptcy certainly complicates the transaction perhaps it was never possible to deal with the utilities past debts and restructure the states power at the same time bankruptcy is a rough but effective tool for dealing with debt one that might help legislators and the governor focus more sharply on future reforms much now depends on the federal bankruptcy judge dennis montali who is known as an effective mediator able to persuade reluctant parties to settle californias economy has survived the power crisis so far but it is not endlessly resilient if pges bankruptcy speeds debt resolution and focuses the governor and legislature on reforming the states power generation transmission and pricing

bankruptcy pge after all did push for the idiotic deregulation scheme that brought it down in one nine nine seven glynn hailed californias deregulation as a huge opportunity for consumers to lower their energy costs the most disingenuous selfdenying fingerpointers are the sacramento politicians who passed signed and delivered this debacle and now blame the federal energy regulatory commission

sector of society moreover it cant be resolved totally within the state capitol energy producers utility execs private financiers ferc and now a bankruptcy judge also wield power so far there has not only been a corporate failurebut also a gubernatorial failure its not just because davis set dual goals of avoiding a consumer rate hike and utility bankruptcy and failed in both its also because the

developing the personal relationships necessary for difficult coalitionbuilding we need a wartime governor right now says one influential democratic lawmaker a wartime governor seizes command and

the california energy crisis california and the west generators scrambled to end pacts with utilities energy even before pge filed for bankruptcy alternative plant owners who hadnt been paid in months pursued court actions byline julie tamaki times staff writer dateline sacramento body in filing for federal bankruptcy protection last week pacific gas electric co determined what other power producers had already concluded the state had failed to solve their payment problems and the time had come for the courts to step in in the days leading up to pges bankruptcy court petition a growing number of alternative energy producers had also been filing lawsuits seeking to be freed from their contracts with pge and southern california edison the litigation was triggered in part by a controversial new rate plan imposed last month by the state public utilities commission in addition to millions of dollars of debt owed to the producers by the utilities on tuesday dynamis inc filed suit in fresno saying pge owes it three million carsonbased watson cogeneration co one of the states largest alternative energy producers also had filed suit to have its contract with edison suspended so did delta power which owns five small gasfired plants in california both producers are owed tens of millions by edison at least a dozen such suits have been filed in civil courts and lawyers warn that more could be on the way tough solutions were not being brought to the equation which left pge and others feeling they were better off in the court system said jerry bloom an attorney for the california cogeneration council the court actions come on the heels of an order by the puc last month that edison and pge begin fully paying hundreds of small alternative energy producers but some producers say that a new rate plan issued by the puc would force them to operate at a loss and that nothing has been done to address the about one five billion owed to members of the group by pge and edison lawyers say other producers have served edison with notices that they plan to cancel their contracts gasfired generators account for about twothirds of the electricity produced by the alternative energy group the california independent system operator keeper of the states power grid reports that there continues to be a roughly three zero zero zero megawatt reduction in output from the alternative energy producers the daily sum is enough power to supply two million to three million typical homes it clearly shows the problem hasnt been fixed said jan smutnyjones executive director of the independent energy producers california is home to nearly seven zero zero producers of alternative and renewable energy which as a group provide more than a quarter of the electricity used by consumers some of the producers have gone offline or reduced supplies for maintenance reasons but others have cut back because they have not been paid by edison since november or have received only partial payments from pge the drop in output has at times forced the state to purchase replacement supplies on the pricey spot market for electricity and contributed to rolling blackouts last month the latter event prompted gov gray davis to propose a plan to get the generators up and running again consequently the puc established a new rate plan for the producers and ordered the utilities to begin fully paying them beginning this month the payment goal would be accomplished in part by slashing the rates that pge and edison must pay the producers but the puc action appears to have compelled a growing number of gasfired generators to file lawsuits in an effort to be released from their contracts with the utilities and be paid the millions they are owed bloom contends that the new rate plan will force some producers to operate at a loss because it does not adequately compensate for their gas expenses he said he expects generators to challenge the plan in court or before the federal energy regulatory commission smutnyjones contends that the plan wrongly assumes that all natural gas used by his members can be piped in from the oregon border where the price of natural gas is cheaper the producers he added are seeking assurances that they will be paid realistic rates by the utilities for future deliveries utilities are scheduled to pay the first round of reduced rates as ordered by the puc early next week both utilities have indicated that they plan to make the first round of payments edison officials said friday they have been served with one zero producer lawsuits they say they fear that if the generators are let out of their contracts they could sell their supplies out of state which could in turn cause rates to rise for california consumers because it would reduce supply pge spokesman john nelson said in an interview last week before the bankruptcy filing that pge has been served with two such lawsuits he said his company is also concerned about the puc rate plan and whether it truly lowered the rates pge must pay the alternative producers and whether there would be enough money in the rates paid by customers to turn around and pay the producers were concerned that the commission decision does not solve the problem nelson said a davis spokesman said last week that the administration is still working on the issue of money owed to the producers and that the administration is continuing to work with the puc to get more generators back online observers believe the number of producer lawsuits will grow because most cases to date have been aimed at edison the utility has not paid its producers since november and has fought to have its rates slashed by comparison pge has made efforts to partially pay its producers in recent months and to keep them informed of their financial situation a bankruptcy court is expected to decide whether to affirm the contracts of producers who sell to pge or to free them to sell their power elsewhere an imperial county judge has already freed calenergy a small geothermal producer from its contract with edison because of edisons failure to pay the company the court has delayed ruling on calenergys request for nine nine million in back payments until april one six the day the utility is expected to begin paying its alternative generators since it quit transmitting two seven zero megawatts to edison last month calenergy has been selling its electricity to el paso energy a marketing company that resells power on the spot market if other generators are able to repeat the pattern

of the nation faces doubledigit price hikes and several statesespecially in the eastcontinue to pay more for electricity than california not even gov gray davis reluctant proposal last week to kick rates up as much as three four five for the heaviest residential users would guarantee california the dubious honor of having the priciest electricity in the united states overshadowed by the rhetoric lawsuits and rolling blackouts is the fact that californians have been paying less for electricity than residents in rhode island new hampshire vermont new york alaska and by a longshot hawaii california in fact is barely in the top one zero when it comes to electrical prices one of the reasons that californians have been paying less is because they conserve more with the average resident draining four zero less from the grid than the average american another reason however is that californias rates have been frozen by law even as the lids have been coming off the prices in other states that are deregulating their utilities i dont know about you guys said state sen sheila kuehl dsanta monica at a hearing last week in sacramento but my constituents dont think they suffered over the past several years because their rates didnt go up four five and five zero the way they did in new york and pennsylvania and other parts of this country these dramatic price spikes are driven by a

americans began to employ more energyefficient appliances computers even lightbulbs and utilities produced their power more and more efficiently at the same time utilities took advantage of low interest rates to help retire massive debt incurred during the highcost postchernobyl building of nuclear reactors and they were thus able to pass on further savings to customers by last year buying a kilowatt hour set the average american back just seven five cents the trend has suddenly stopped in a forecast released friday the energy information administration predicts that a kilowatt hour will cost about eight cents on average nationally by the end of this year and rise another halfcent in two zero zero two for the first time in a long time the prices are going up said administration forecaster neil gamson a onecent increase in the price per kilowatt hour would boost the monthly bill of a typical california residential customer by about one zero to one one seven for big industrial users the extra monthly cost could be in the thousands substantial regional differences have always existed with the northeast the longtime home of the highest prices in the continental us some northeastern customers pay twice as much or more than consumers three zero zero zero miles due west one reason is that although environmental laws in the northeast are typically less stringent than those in california and the northwest growing concerns and tougher antipollution legislation have forced utilities to shift away from the higherpolluting coalpowered generators and toward cleanerburning natural gas the environmentally conscious move has left them like several other areas vulnerable to the recent price spikes of natural gas the northeast is also farther from most major sources of fuel including natural gas oil and coal several states in the northeast including connecticut maine new hampshire new york and massachusetts are actively deregulating like california only with less drama they are finding the birth of a free market painful and expensive under massachusetts deregulation statute the standard retail rate for a kilowatt hour was fixed at an average of just over nine cents through two zero zero five however the rise in natural gas prices has left utilities pleading with regulators to allow them to raise prices lest they face californias problem of selling their power at a lossprecisely the circumstance that led the pacific gas electric co of san francisco to declare bankruptcy friday kilowatt hours average cost rising earlier this month the massachusetts electric co got the goahead to charge two seven zero zero zero zero residential customers an additional two three statewide analysts say the average price of a kilowatt hour is probably edging up from its already high october figure the last available of one one two cents in new york the average cost of a kilowatt hour statewide was one four one cents in october however even under a

kilowatt hour in recent months still cornell university economist tim mount said he would be surprised and very disappointed if we mess things up in the east as badly as they messed it up in california i think the regulators thought that it would be easy to run a market and they didnt allow for very much malfeasance on the part of newly untethered utilities or private power generators the south with its coal reserves has long hovered in the relatively cheap range of six to eight cents per kilowatt hour and along with the midwest is likely to be among the most stable areas in the near

utilities in the northwest receive huge portions of their juice from the bonneville power administration which oversees two nine dams in the columbia and snake river basins and provides four five of the regions electricity however the severity of the regions droughtand the accompanying electricity shortagewas illustrated last week when the bpa announced that it would stop spilling precious water over its dams to help the spring salmon run announcing the news to residents who for decades have fought to restore salmon runs decimated by the dams was perhaps made a bit easier for acting bpa administrator steve wright because he had previously made another announcement the bpa wright said would likely be raising its own wholesale rates from nine five to two zero zero come october some of the rate hikes around the country are surcharges meant to fill utility coffers left empty by the leap in natural gas prices for example many others however are viewed as permanent in the west

reorganization is a highly respected scholar and effective mediator known for persuading reluctant parties to reach agreement in a recent case montali achieved in only three days a settlement between a debtor and creditors in the bankruptcy of an international engineering firm the case had been in bruising litigation for two years when another judge asked montali to mediate it as a lawyer montali helped divert a statewide agricultural crisis one zero years ago by persuading warring factions to accept a deal in the bankruptcy of an agricultural cooperative according to a lawyer in the case he is very good at not embarrassing people but getting them to understand they are wrong said lawyer larry engel who has known and worked with montali for two decades montali six zero the son of a winemaker grew up in san francisco and now lives in berkeley he is considered among the top tier of bankruptcy experts in the united states he will be calling the shots in one of the largest bankruptcy reorganizations in us history the case raises unprecedented legal questions and is expected to make new law some of the legal disputes may wind up before the us supreme court attorneys said lawyers who know the easygoing witty judge say he is probably relishing this legal challenge the way a golfer looks forward to playing a new and more difficult course the court action begins today when montali is expected to decide whether pge can spend cash that others have laid claims to right from the beginning montali will be in the limelight and lawyers will be eagerly searching for any clues to his leanings montali declined to be interviewed but those who know him say he is fair smart hardworking and thoughtful he does not browbeat but quietly negotiates to bring people around lawyers said the judge is highly engaged in his cases he is well prepared intellectually curious and knows the hard questions to ask lawyers said he also is a relatively quick decisionmaker frequently ruling from the bench reality tends to come out in his courtroom because montali does not allow lawyers to evade his questions engel said there are few precedents to guide montali in many of the novel legal questions he is likely to be asked to rule upon can he order electricity rate hikes the law is unclear can he force energy suppliers to hold down their prices doubtful bankruptcy lawyers said can he force pges parent company to cough up some money possibly can he force pge to sell off assets yes but probably not in the near term this is going to be one of these cases where the envelope is going to be pushed and i think there is a danger in making any categorical statements right now said a bankruptcy lawyer who is involved in the case pges chapter one one bankruptcy reorganization will be enormously complex legally lawyers said montali will have to reconcile state utility law and federal energy law with bankruptcy law bankruptcy judges have broad discretion to decide disputes and montali will control pges purse strings lawyers who know montali well say he is savvy about using the internet to communicate court information masters arcane legal subjects quickly and probably is thrilled to be making the calls in a case that will be watched nationally some people go on the bench to retire montali went on in one nine nine three to have more fun intellectually lawyers said montali tends to be very constructive said another lawyer who asked not to be identified by name because he may represent a creditor in the pge case he wants his cases to go somewhere and he tries to encourage people to make progress before he was appointed to the bench montali had practiced bankruptcy law for more than two decades he began representing debtors but was doing primarily creditor work in his last law firm job with the citys venerable pillsbury madison sutro the bankruptcy bar he was a part of is relatively small and the lawyers who practice it know one another several lawyers interviewed about montali referred to him by his first name because these lawyers are likely to be players together in many cases over the years trustworthiness is important bankruptcy attorneys said effectiveness requires that other members of the bar trust your word and credibility the practice also requires knowledge of economics and economic terms ease both with deal making and trial work and above all else practicality lawyers said whereas a business litigator may know exactly what he or she will be doing two months from now bankruptcy lawyers tend to operate on tight deadlines with little notice many of these lawyers were at their desks over the weekend preparing for the pge case there is no one in town who is not part of this case said engel who is representing a municipal utility everyone is involved montali is tall lanky and balding his trademark is his handlebar mustache which he has worn for decades and which reflects his gregariousness and humor other lawyers said he cooks italian food expertly and likes to sail around san francisco bay and walk his dog during his time away from work his wife mary is in the real estate business and they have three grown daughters as a lawyer montali was masterful at bringing about a compromise in the bankruptcy of a major agricultural cooperative a decade ago engels said at the time the coop went bankrupt farmers had picked their crops but there was no money to operate the canneries and no money to pay the growers montali was representing a bank in the case we could have had a disaster engel said literally imagine if five zero zero zero farmers lost their entire crop because there was nobody to take it each of them would have gone into bankruptcy the parties locked themselves together in one place for a week and half montali was at the core of it engel said he persuaded all parties to agree to a plan that involved selling the cooperative he would take someone who was being a problem over to the side and explain that it wasnt going to work if they persisted that way engel said he is the ultimate reasonable man who convinced them that this path is the one they needed to be on in their own selfinterest richard levin a los angeles bankruptcy lawyer said montali has tremendous integrity as a lawyer he was cogent and forceful in arguments and would make simple clear statements that would cause everyone in the courtroom to pause and think levin said montali earned a bachelors degree in english from notre dame university and then entered the navy to fulfill a reserve officers training corps commitment he served in various officer positions on two destroyers and taught briefly at the united states navy reserve officers candidate school in newport ri before entering law school he obtained his law degree from uc berkeleys boalt hall school of law in one nine six eight montali has been elected to the national bankruptcy conference and the american college of bankruptcy both elite bodies reserved for those at the top of their field last year he was appointed to hear appeals in bankruptcy cases for the us nine th circuit court of appeals in addition to his trial duties one of his first cases on the bench ended in disaster shortly after he became a judge he ruled in favor of a landlord who was trying to evict a tenant the tenant had a bankruptcy case before montali the tenant later went to the landlords office shot and killed him wounded the landlords son and tried to kill himself i didnt have any regret about the decision montali told the daily journal a legal newspaper several years ago but it reinforced in the real world that im making decisions that affect people it put some real meaning into things in one nine nine seven montali ruled that a gay man was liable for damages because he failed to warn his former lover that he was infected with hiv before they had unprotected sex the case had wound up before montali because the defendant filed for bankruptcy to avoid paying

example american electric power a columbus ohiobased leader of the utility industry told shareholders in its annual report that californias blunders of insufficient power supplies total reliance on spot pricing and capping of rates for retail consumers even as costs of wholesale power multiplied are not likely to be replicated elsewhere indeed many of deregulations dangers may be avoided now simply because california and pge have put everybody on their guard californias horrible example has spurred recognition that power plants need to be built and pges collapse sends a message that utility companies operating partly in regulated and unregulated environments need to separate their accounts so as to better understand the different businesses they are managing wall street sees electricity as a growth industry just because power is in relative short supply in many parts of the country the united states has not built enough power plants over the last one zero years to meet demand says analyst brian youngberg of edward jones co a st louisbased investment company that spells opportunity for companies able to produce lowcost power and market it in different regions promising investment todays favored utilities are those moving to acquire power plants and sell power as an unregulated commodity in different areas even as they cope with deregulation and competition

venerable pioneer of the utility industry it originated the practice of siting power plants atop coal mines so the fuel could be transferred efficiently to the steam turbine boilers now its home state of ohio is going through a threeyear process of deregulating electricity so aep is going aggressively into wholesale electricity generation and marketing last year it acquired dallasbased central southwest co and now markets in texas louisiana and oklahoma as well as its traditional bases in ohio and michigan aep too is going to separate its unregulated and regulated businesses its doing this the company told shareholders because it will enable investors to value our businesses separately and will improve our ability to manage the realities of electric deregulation and to focus on the differing capital requirements of each business why is that significant because pge the holding company that owns pacific gas electric also has thriving energy trading and outofstate electricity operations within its corporate structure it built up the unregulated business in recent years by transferring proceeds from sales of california power plants and cash flow accruing from the states complex deregulation scheme but pge didnt separate the unregulated and regulated businesses for shareholders and now pges publicly traded stock has lost seven seven of its value and the company faces a battle in bankruptcy court to keep its unregulated assets out of the hands of creditors avoiding mistakes as companies elsewhere try to avoid pges errors so other states take pains not to make

massachusetts connecticut new hampshire and rhode island which have deregulated also have plenty of spare capacity reports cambridge energy research associates with electricity in surplus those states and regions can encourage price competition in electricity but when there are shortages as began to occur last year in california desperation buying by customers and price gouging by suppliers are all

transformation its not unlike the telephone business that has changed so much in the last three zero years starting from say the rise of mci in the one nine seven zero s or the breakup of att corp in

bankruptcy filing source chronicle staff writer byline david lazarus body californias energy mess took an ugly turn yesterday as gov gray davis and pacific gas and electric co traded barbs over who is to blame for the bankruptcy of the states largest utility in a series of titfortat statements each side laid claim to the moral high ground while insisting that the other had been dealing in bad faith the governor spent part of his time yesterday giving television interviews in response to the chronicles report saturday that pge awarded five zero million in bonuses and raises to six zero zero zero employees just hours before fridays bankruptcy filing pges management is suffering from two afflictions denial and greed davis said in a brief statement saturday night in a testy reply pge countered that instead of focusing all his attention on solving the states yearlong and everworsening energy crisis the governor has launched a campaignstyle attack on our company pge said davis was criticizing thousands of men and women who have worked tirelessly and professionally through this crisis and concluded that california would be far better served if the governor turned his attention to the crisis at hand steve maviglio a spokesman for the governor fired back yesterday pge waged a public relations war on friday if theyre looking for somebody to blame they should look in the mirror maviglio also said the governor was concentrating on reaching a final accord with southern california edison co for the state to purchase the cashstrapped companys power lines for nearly two eight billion a last round of talks was scheduled to be held last night there are a few remaining details to be worked out but it seems pretty close maviglio said adding that an announcement of the deal could come as early as today the governor is spending his time negotiating with a responsible utility he said along with the edison deal davis spent the weekend huddling with energy advisers and lawyers trying to come up with an appropriate response to pges bankruptcy bombshell efforts to stabilize californias dysfunctional electricity market suddenly have become much more complex not much changed nevertheless while pges bankruptcy is by far the most sensational aspect of californias longdrawnout energy mess at the end of the day it doesnt really change a thing consider pges financial woes stem from a rate freeze that prevented the utility from passing along to customers runaway wholesale power costs that rate freeze and skyhigh electricity prices remain in place californias energy shortage is primarily the result of the state not having built any major power plants for the past one two years pges bankruptcy does nothing to affect that precarious situation pges foray into bankruptcy court does not alter the fact that electricity demand is outpacing available supply california consumers still face a threat of daily blackouts when power usage spikes this summer the crux of the problem is still the same said loretta lynch president of the state public utilities commission we face the same challenges we did before pge filed for bankruptcy she added however that pges bankruptcy increases the uncertainty the utility doesnt see it that way pge spokesman ron low said californias energy woes are no more uncertain now than they were when the company ostensibly was negotiating with davis to find an equitable solution to the states troubles california remains in an energy crisis he said as we head toward summer resources are going to be very tight what could happen in the short run consumers will notice no change whatsoever bankruptcy protection will allow pge to continue operating as usual while the companys creditors line up to receive at least partial payment of outstanding bills longer term there is a very real possibility that electricity rates will soar if the bankruptcy judge agrees with pge that conditions for lifting the rate freeze were met a year ago and that nine billion in subsequent expenses must be borne by consumers how much peoples bills would rise depends on how the rate increase is structured it would probably come in the form of a surcharge on existing fees but the monthly hit to consumers could be limited by spreading the total cost over a number of years the big question mark now is how pges bankruptcy will affect various political and legislative measures intended to keep californias lights on the states attempt to purchase pges power lines is obviously finished although a new deal could be negotiated in bankruptcy court meanwhile the governor is pressing ahead with plans to purchase the transmission systems of edison and sempra energys san diego utility although what the state would do with only a partial power grid has yet to be determined does it make any sense to have the transmission lines of edison and sempra and not pge asked state senate president pro tem john burton dsan francisco i dont know the answer to that a final accord with edison this week would validate pges apparent concerns that it would have had a harder time limiting backlash to its bankruptcy filing if the utility had acted after a breakthrough with edison was unveiled the chronicle quoted pge insiders yesterday as saying that the decision to file for bankruptcy had been made early last week even though senior company officials said the move followed the governors thursday night speech on solving californias energy issues one reason pge opted to file on friday morning was because a final deal with edison was expected at any time observers said paul patterson an analyst at credit suisse first boston noted that if pge had filed for bankruptcy after edison came to terms with the state they would be seen as a spoiler ensuing confusion in any case pges surprise filing has left all concerned scrambling for footing in the changed political landscape consumer advocates watched with dismay yesterday as the states political and corporate powers slugged it out for supremacy nettie hoge executive director of the utility reform network in san francisco said all this fingerpointing will do nothing to ensure that californians have ample

burn through more than two billion a month this summer some state democratic leaders are pushing for a takeover of private power plants to get soaring prices under control lawmakers concede that sending state agents to grab the keys of power generating plants would be an extraordinary measure but now that pacific gas and electric co has limited the states options with fridays bankruptcy filing and with little hope for stronger federal price controls state senate leader john burton and others say seizing power plants makes financial and political sense they say theyve done the math since january california has spent more than four billion buying power thats about one billion more than private energy firms paid for the power plants pge and californias two other investorowned utilities were forced to sell under californias botched deregulation plan at those rates california could soon look like a renter paying the full value of the house several times a year profits of three zero zero percent are not uncommon for large private generators which provide about four zero percent of the states power needs the state could seize the assets compensate the companies and then sell the electricity to consumers at cost advocates of the plan say we have to do something said burton dsan francisco one of a group of legislators who urged davis at a meeting last week to condemn some of the plants these people have got us by the throat theyre making more money than god and weve got to fight back not with words but with actions davis himself raised the specter of using his emergency powers to take over power plants with a fiery flourish during his state of the state address earlier this year if i have to use the power of eminent domain to prevent generators from driving consumers into the dark and utilities into bankruptcy then thats what i will do he said in january davis still hasnt ruled out the possibility but he says its not high on his list of tactics generators say they would fight tooth and nail against such a grab and state gop lawmakers oppose condemnation saying it smacks of underdeveloped countries nationalizing key industries but burton and other democrats including state senators don perata doakland and jackie speier dhillsborough say the governors strategy so far has left giant energy firms holding all the cards and a mounting pile of the states cash davis had been trying to restore the financial stability of pge and southern california edison after their combined one four billion debt for electricity purchases so damaged their creditworthiness that the state had to take over buying power but now that pge has sought bankruptcy protection rather than accept davis plan to buy its transmission lines the state may be stuck with the role of power buyer for years powers of eminent domain sacramento lawyer richard desmond an expert on state powers of eminent domain said california could seize generating plants by demonstrating that it would put the properties to a higher and more necessary use the government has almost unlimited power of eminent domain to acquire property desmond said the only thing the state has to do is pay just compensation as defined under the constitution the state could file a formal suit for eminent domain a timeconsuming procedure if the owner mounts a fierce resistance over the transfer price desmond said if the state wants to take immediate possession it can deposit an estimate of the just compensation and fight it out later in court but if the state loses it could be stuck for interest litigation costs and damages condemnation of power plants would raise a number of unknowns such as figuring out who would manage and operate the facilities the state might also be put into the position of having to seize contracts between the generators and natural gas providers davis spokesman roger salazar said the governors first priority was building new plants to increase supply rather than condemning existing plants state sen jim battin rpalm desert said he thought seizing plants was a horrible idea we would become a third world country and start nationalizing things battin said nobody would ever build a power plant in california again i think that would be a really bad play company would fight tom williams a spokesman for duke energy said the company would fight vigorously to protect its multimilliondollar investment in four california plants including morro bay and moss landing we would defend our interest and seek a fair market value williams said duke spent six one one million to buy or lease the four plants since one nine nine eight and has embarked on a one six billion program to upgrade and expand them some power companies however may find their claims for the fair market value of their plants undercut by their own tax filings energy firms including duke told county assessors last year that the utility plants they bought were worth hundreds of millions of dollars less than they paid for them private companies including duke dynegy southern energy aes corp and calpine spent a total of three two billion to buy divested utility power plants that can produce as much as two zero zero zero zero megawatts underlying problem unsolved williams said taking over the property of private companies would not solve the underlying problem behind californias high energy prices rising demand and an inadequate supply of energy to fill it even if davis seized only one plant the move might spur other power generators to drop their prices said doug heller of

for longhundreds of new wells are being drilled because of higher pricesbut the boom in the gasfired generation of electricity raises questions about whether high demand from those plants will prevent prices from sliding back to what they were a few years ago and as electricity becomes increasingly tied to natural gas observers say the demands on one are more likely to change the price of the other we should be concerned about it said william abolt chicagos environment commissioner youre getting one energy market where the decisions that are made about natural gas affect the price of electricity although abolt advocates using natural gas instead of coal to generate electricityit means cleaner air he saidhe wonders if the gas industry is prepared for growing demand on its supplies generating electricity takes a lot of gas midwest generations gasfired power plant in morris last year burned enough to keep about one nine two zero zero zero homes supplied with natural gas for a year two four billion cubic feet that plant generated only about seven percent of all the electricity that midwest produced mostly by burning coal despite the spike in gas prices during the winter some companies planning to build gasfired power plants said they have not changed their minds even if gas prices never drop to what they were a year ago they said the new plants will still be cleaner than coal and efficient flexible and profitable skip horvath president of the natural gas supply association said his industry is planning for the coming demandon paper anyway we are working flatout to meet that demand he said but we are running into constraints that are slowing us down among those constraints finding workers to operate drilling rigs finding engineers to design them and locate the supplies getting access to land where the supplies exist since one nine nine eight three three companies have proposed projects in illinois that would total about two five zero zero zero megawatts of gasfired

zero zero megawatts to come on line the states total generation capacity now by comparison is just under three four zero zero zero megawatts including the gasfired plants that recently have begun generating in illinois natural gas makes up about two zero percent of the electricity generating capacitysome of which comes from plants that can burn either gas or oil the rest of the states capacity comes from coal five zero percent and nuclear reactors three zero percent if not all of the new generating capacity of the proposed gasfired plants is needed in illinois some of it may be destined for

electricity for years but its only been in the past few that it really has begun to take off horvath stops short of saying the industry was caught off guard he points to other demands as contributing to high gas prices during the winter such as a very cold november and december and a good economy that increased the amount of gas used by industrial and commercial customers we were surprised by the magnitude of the turn toward naturalgas electric generation horvath said that turn holds true for illinois just two small coalfired projects are on the states list of pending permits a one nine nine

trillion cubic feet in two zero one five gasfired power generation is especially attractive in illinois for a couple of reasons first electricity deregulation means companies other than electric utilities can build plants and sell power second theres easy access to many interstate gas pipelines the extent to which all of the new plants will affect gas supply remains to be seen some of the plants wont ever get built and natural gas production has already increased dramatically i really dont think we will see a tremendous supply problem said jim monk president of the illinois energy association a trade group for electric utilities the question it comes down to is what price people would have to charge for electricity because of the gas prices said john long a vice president at midwest generation for now deregulation has frozen electricity rates in illinois until two zero zero four commonwealth edison has made longterm contracts with its electricity suppliers so that electric rates dont reflect the higher price of gas that means companies such as midwest generation had to absorb the higher cost of generating electricity with gas midwest switched to burning oil at

substantially lower than the eight three million in payments suspended in january when the utility announced costcutting measures that eight three million included bonuses for employee performance and a bonus based on the companys success as we close the books for two zero zero zero we have determined that we are unable to make that portion of the incentive payment due to the negative financial

the company would use the money to restructure its debt edison has agreed in principle to sell the state its transmission system however the company is seeking relief from some puc regulations that

byline james flanigan body california which led the nation into electric power deregulation is about to give it another model to contemplate public power the bankruptcy filing friday of pge corps pacific gas electric co only underlines the role that a new state power authority is slated to play as an electricity supplier of last resort the authority which is being set up through legislation would finance power plants even build them if necessary it probably would own and expand the transmission lines that carry power throughout the state energy experts such as s david freeman general manager of the los angeles department of water and power say a california power authority is the only way to get plants built and paid for state treasurer philip angelides has been preparing since january to set one up and mayor richard riordan of los angeles says that a state authority is the only way to get siting for power plants and get things moving the pacific gas electric bankruptcy filing will delay some plans such as the states proposed purchase of the utilitys transmission lines but ultimately state ownership will be necessary because no private party seems able or willing to invest one billion or so to upgrade the lines to meet californias needs in the long term public power would ensure that california has a surplus of electricity instead of the shortages it has today but that security is expected to come at a price as the costs of power may be higher than many other states will be paying electricity deregulation nationwide may yet fulfill its promise of lower rates and better service time will tell but californias flawed deregulation plan has failed and now state funds and public agencies are picking up the pieces the states costs will be high angelides plans to sell one seven billion in revenue bonds to finance purchases of electricity and transmission lines but thursday night after gov gray davis speech on energy state officials gave a briefing to financial analysts in which state debt numbers totaling two zero billion were discussed as well as revenue bonds for utility debts of eight billion california electricity users would pay such debts over one five years reports gerald keenan a utility strategist for the accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers who participated in thursdays briefing the prospect is that electricity delivery in california a few years from now will not be in the hands of the three investorowned utilities but will be owned by municipal and regional agencies yet the real story amid todays chaos and uncertainty is that california residents and even the investorowned utilities themselves welcome the shift from private to public ownership political support has been growing last summer when electric bills first rose in san diego residents called for the city to take over sempra energys san diego gas electric subsidiary similar groups in san francisco were calling for cityowned power long before supplier pacific gas electric filed for bankruptcy the los angeles department of water and power is the model other cities are looking to the nations largest municipally owned utility at two seven billion in annual revenue the dwp has been hailed for having abundant power supplies at low prices all through the states energy crisis it has those supplies because the dwp like all municipal utilities was exempt from deregulation public power is taking a giant leap and private power meanwhile has fallen on its face says dwp chief freeman veteran of public power agencies for more than three zero years freeman who favored deregulation when he came to los angeles in one nine nine seven now says it has wrecked a good system since the days of thomas edison private utilities were responsible for keeping the lights on he says the deal was you got a local monopoly for that you earned a rate of return on your assets and paid a secure dividend and widows owned your stock but deregulation which sought to spur competition among generators of electric power changed all that in california pacific gas electric edison internationals southern california edison and sdge were forced to sell their power plants to other companies subsequently they got caught up in the ruinous spiral of paying high prices for wholesale power but having to sell it at low fixed prices to retail customers now the role of investorowned electric utilities in the state may be at an end and the irony sources say is that their parent companies are quietly happy to relinquish the business all have developed profitable unregulated subsidiaries and nonutility divisions pge corp for example gets more than five zero of its two four billion in annual revenue from unregulated powergenerating facilities in other states and from energy trading without its utility pge sees itself as a growing company participating in the transformation of electricity markets nationwide and worldwide elsewhere after all utility companies such as north carolinas duke energy kansas utilicorp united and georgias mirant corp formerly southern co are hailed as attractive growth companies by investment analysts similarly edison international earns almost four zero zero million a year in profit from its edison mission energy and edison capital subsidiaries a company headquartered in a state short of power plants mission energy is the secondlargest owner of power plants in the united states with facilities in pennsylvania illinois and the midwest as well as plants in europe and asia edison and pge have taken pains to segregate those moneymaking subsidiaries from their regulated businesses although lawyers for creditors in the pge bankruptcy proceeding will surely try to attach such profitable assets a comparable pattern of regulated and unregulated divisions holds for sempra which is not threatened by the massive debts overhanging pge and edison so whats the real outlook for the states utility companiesand for the states electricity supply the dwps freeman sees the companies spinning off their utility subsidiaries to shareholders or selling them to municipalities he notes their boards of directors are saying why do we need this heartache fine but will a change in utility ownership help solve californias energy crisis not really says lawrence makovich senior electricity analyst at cambridge energy research associates california is pursuing distractions arguing about transmission lines and utility finances he says it needs to build power plants but freeman counters that state authority and public ownership are just what will ensure that plants are built well see to it that enough plants are built and old plants repowered to give the state a one five reserve of power says freeman who has headed the tennessee valley authority the new york state power authority and the sacramento municipal utility district in a long career attaining a one five reserve would mean adding at least five zero zero zero megawatts of powerenough to serve about three seven five million typical homes the price of power he reckons will be six zero to seven zero a megawatthour thats about double the cost before the energy crisisbut a bargain compared with current rates in californias dysfunctional spot market many electric bills are sure to rise three zero to four zero but well have our power and that rate may be reasonable compared with those of other states a few years from now freeman says by two zero zero three well be out of the woods and by two zero zero four california will be a model to the rest of the country will the california model of state power work better than its deregulation did wed better hope so james flanigan can be reached at jimflaniganlatimescom graphic photo dwp general

environmental groups worried about pge lands to sacramento municipal utility district customers who might face more rate hikes if changes are made to complex power contracts that involve pge smud and a key smud supplier amid intense focus on the bankruptcys implications pge was upbraided saturday by davis and consumer groups for paying incentive bonuses to about six zero zero zero executives and workers thursday one day before it declared bankruptcy pges management is suffering from two afflictions denial and greed davis said the bonuses normally given out annually were withheld in january as part of pges cash conservation efforts they were resumed along with power line upgrades and other programs when the utility concluded it had enough cash said pge spokesman john nelson they would have totaled eight zero million in a good year and were less this year he said unable to supply a figure the money went to everyone from file clerks to company directors but excluded company officers nelson said while pge was defending its actions judge montali was apparently at work saturday as updates on next weeks hearing schedule appeared on the web page of the federal bankruptcy courts northern district before his appointment eight years ago montali was a prominent san francisco bankruptcy lawyer who tackled major cases hes a workaholic hell work as many hours as it takes said san francisco bankruptcy lawyer john hansen who has known montali for more than two five years he described the judge as likely to look for creative solutions and probably willing to establish new law if he concludes theres a basis for quickly raising electric rates montali a six one yearold judge with long experience handling bankruptcy cases will face some daunting rulings as he presides over the largest utility bankruptcy filing in the countrys history should he force pges parent company to pay off some debts of its subsidiary should he force the utility to give up its transmission lines or its hydroelectric plants to the state should he call for pge customers to pay higher rates as part of the reorganization plan and if so how much he is certainly going to get his one five minutes of fame said lynn lopucki a law professor at the university of california los angeles how would you like to be the guy who triples the utility rates of the state where he sits as lopucki notes under federal law a bankruptcy judge cannot permanently raise rates in california without approval of the states public utilities commission but while a utilitys reorganization is being shaped by the court he said a judge appears to have wide latitude to unilaterally raise rates until he approves a final plan the point has not been litigated in previous utility bankruptcy filings but one section of the federal bankruptcy code says a judge may issue any order process or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provision of this title a lot of us have assumed the bankruptcy judge has no authority to raise rates while the case has gone on said lopucki but that has been called into question by various lawyers and it is far from settled hansen said it would not be beyond the pale for a bankruptcy judge to conclude that pge cant reasonably put together a reorganization plan until it can charge enough to cover its wholesale costs over the last year average wholesale electricity prices have increased more than eight zero zero percent while retail rates have gone up just under five zero percent the judge would be making new law he said and from what he knows of montali i dont think hed be hesitant to do it if he chooses montali could hand down those decisions with no input from the five five million households and businesses that write checks to pge every month consumer groups are not powerless they could sue to force pges parent company to pay some of the utilitys debts assuming the puc fails in its own attempt to require pge corp to kick in some money and lopucki said he wouldnt be surprised if judge montali gave consumer groups some kind of voice in the proceedings but there is no requirement for a bankruptcy judge to listen to consumers acknowledged harvey rosenfield of the foundation for taxpayers and consumer rights still his group will try to be heard any legitimate process has to include the ratepayers he said and courts have allowed it before the case to continue monday with hearings into numerous issues on how pge handles its cash potentially could affect every element of the states electricity morass montali could determine whether a two nine percent average rate hike approved by regulators last month is divvied up as the puc specified if the judge approves some other formula that could call into question how the state is repaid for pges share of the three billionplus california has spent buying power since january pge has complained that the state formula is unfair but utility spokesman nelson said saturday that pge believes payments to california will be made in full because they are protected under state law the judge has another route to raise rates if he chooses he could decide to pull pges existing federal lawsuit against the puc into the bankruptcy proceeding and rule himself on whether federal law forces state regulators to let pge raise rates montali also will review pges dealings with alternative power plants called qualifying facilities and if pge asks to sever those contracts he could cut them free which would force pge to buy more of its power on the pricey wholesale market and increase costs for its customers he could approve the sale of utility property including up to one four zero zero zero zero acres of pge forest lands reservoirs and campgrounds that could mean that some of its lands are sold to developers and their environmental values will be lost said steve evans of the conservation group friends of the river consumer advocate michael shames said his biggest fear is not that the judge would raise rates but that to restore pge to health its power plants or other assets would be sold off and put in the hands of the same friendly folks whove been gouging us and for the most part the consumers who could be touched by almost every action the judge takes will be watching haskel causey coowner of a lumber company in west sacramento said he wasnt thrilled about a bankruptcy judge determining the rates paid by one three million people in pges service territory its going to have a tremendous effect on the economy causey said saturday of the prospect of higher rates people will

private corporations operating solely for profit bee editorial august two nine one nine one two as california struggles to regain control of its electricity system it is easy to lose sight of the big picture and hard to contemplate how history could provide any guidance to something so contemporary so monstrously complex yet history turns out to be a valuable compass that could help lead us in the right direction this seemingly new fight over generators grids and prices is actually a very old one dormant for decades as the status quo remained unchanged it has abruptly reawakened todays debate is couched in the language of our time with all those energy institutions with abbreviations like ferc iso puc and px fundamentally however the dilemma remains unchanged electricity is as unique a commodity as it is vital it cannot be stored it must be generated precisely when it is needed this poses an extraordinary challenge for government to guarantee a reliable affordable supply it demands a balancing of the vital roles of the public and private sectors given todays crisis private utilities wallowing in debt merchant generators extracting high prices consumers facing everrising rates the search for that right balance remains an elusive one this newspaper first engaged the question near its very inception the west was young the rules of the game were largely unwritten and the public interest was threatened by private greed would government or companies dam the rivers and build the hydroelectric plants who would control the grid and perhaps most important could citizens revolt against the local privately held monopoly and turn power into a public enterprise thats what sacramento did against pge in the one nine two zero s voters created the sacramento municipal utility district they funded hydroelectric projects in the sierra and they wrested the local distribution system from a resistant pge other cities such as lodi roseville modesto los angeles and redding created public power agencies or city power departments with leaders elected by voters not shareholders the eventual result in california was a blend of public and privately held agencies public power provided a yardstick by which to measure the private sector this system was hardly perfect but it wasnt broken now it is the fixes must redefine the roles of the public and private sectors to bring the system back in balance will government or private companies own the new plants that supply those precious last megawatts of power at the pricey peak who will own or expand the transmission grid to relieve bottlenecks that stifle competition will private utilities be allowed to take their customers for granted or will citizens have the unfettered right to create a public power agency in their community in our race to deregulate in the one nine nine zero s we forgot how public power has provided the discipline for the private marketplace that left to itself will feast on price volatility the public interest simply cannot be delegated to the private sector not then not now not ever this is the lesson of history as we go about the fixes we cannot afford to forget

officials scramble for solution byline by steve johnson body san jose calif _ the way they lambasted each other for pges plunge into bankruptcy friday gov gray davis and the utilitys top executives sounded like innocent passengers on the titanic seemingly powerless to prevent it from sinking in reality the governor and officials at pacific gas electric co _ along with state regulators _ were supposed to be at the helm though pges fortunes are now in the hands of a bankruptcy judge little has changed for state authorities they still bear much of the responsibility for charting californias course out of its energy crisis but the problems that pge ran into _ from a critical shortage of power plants to an easily manipulated electricity market _ still threaten the state and wont be quickly solved eager to avoid another utility bankruptcy davis officials met saturday with southern california edison officials in san francisco to firm up state plans to buy the transmission lines of edison and the san diego utility owned by sempra energy co the idea is to give those businesses _ especially financially strapped edison _ a muchneeded infusion of cash but since the states hopes to buy pges lines have hit a major snag some people worry that the state may wind up owning only half of californias power grid which they fear would be of limited value does it make any sense to have the transmission lines of edison and sempra and not pge asked senate president pro tem john burton dsan francisco on saturday i dont know the answer to that davis spokesman steve maviglio said saturday that the state is exploring the possibility of acquiring pges transmission lines through the bankruptcy court in fact maviglio said some lawmakers are mulling the idea of taking over all of pge _ an option davis has not ruled out even if the state does take over all three companies lines _ and pges other operations _ it would still have to deal with the major hazards that contributed to pges demise and until some way is found to navigate around those many experts believe california and its consumers will remain in perilous straits as things stand now said stanford economist frank wolak were looking at a disaster in a big way this summer the shortage of power supplies in explaining why the utility suddenly filed for bankruptcy _ catching davis and other lawmakers by surprise _ robert glynn jr pacific gas and electric co chairman said negotiations with the governor were going nowhere davis fired back that pge has dishonored itself and acted in a selfish manner yet a more fundamental reason for pges financial collapse is californias critical shortage of power plants and despite pges bankruptcy that situation hasnt changed under the one nine nine six law that deregulated the sale of electricity in california pge and other utilities were encouraged to sell their power plants so other companies could enter the energy producing business presumably spurring competition and lowering prices for consumers but while companies did buy many of pges plants they delayed building new ones because of uncertainties about the newly deregulated system meanwhile the states population _ and its power demands _ continued to grow the result was highlighted in a recent report by the california independent system operator which oversees most of the power grid it predicted the state would be nearly six zero zero zero megawatts short by june _ enough for four five million homes despite pges bankruptcy action the fundamentals havent changed said california public utilities commissioner richard bilas saturday we havent enough supply and too much demandits not good it really isnt the markets vulnerability to manipulation that dearth of power is primarily responsible for driving up the price of power which heavily contributed to pges financial troubles since the rate it has been permitted by law to charge its customers doesnt cover all its power costs but california officials accuse electricity suppliers of also manipulating the energy market to help those prices rise among other things the companies have been accused of switching off some of their plants just before demand for power soars to earn top dollar for the electricity they produce from other plants that charge has been vehemently denied by suppliers but state officials are suspicious because in recent months more than a fourth of the states entire generating capacity has been out of commission for what their operators claim was necessary maintenance erik saltmarsh chief counsel to the california electricity oversight board said its too early to know if pges bankruptcy filing will make it easier or harder for price gouging to occur he noted that some power suppliers have characterized the high prices they charged pge as a kind of risk premium since they werent sure the struggling utility would repay them once the bankruptcy court stabilizes pges financial condition saltmarsh said that excuse may vanish but he said the filing also might prompt some suppliers to charge even higher prices while the state buys power on pges behalf out of fear that the bankruptcy proceedings might somehow limit that opportunity in the future i dont know what will happen saltmarsh said but i certainly wouldnt take the position that our vulnerability to high charges just got reduced the governments regulatory hodge podge over the past few months the state has quickly run up billions of dollars in power bills with no end in sight yet no single regulatory body is in charge of making sure the state is getting its moneys worth as it is now five separate state agencies oversee various critical aspects of californias energy markets _ monitoring the flow of electricity keeping track of utility operations approving new generators and purchasing power now a bankruptcy court will get into the act as well and some lawmakers are pushing to create still another governmental body _ a power authority which could buy or build its own generating plants but the one agency with the most clout over electricity suppliers and the prices they charge _ the federal energy regulatory commission _ so far has declined to do what state officials have begged it to do punish companies accused of charging too much and despite pges bankruptcy action that reluctance appears unlikely to change i personally am not sure the federal government should get involved in such matters said public utilities commissioner henry duque were big boys and we should be able to handle it ourselves but the commissions president loretta lynch disagrees in a statement she issued in response to pges bankruptcy announcement she pointed out that neither the commission nor the governor has the power alone to change these prices because the ferc has authority over californias wholesale energy markets the fickleness of mother nature because of its razor thin electricity reserves california is particularly at the mercy of the weather which hasnt been kind lately a drought across the pacific northwest has severely reduced the amount of water gushing through the hydroelectric dams that this state relies on for power in emergencies and that problem could be aggravated by hot weather this summer last june record temperatures were partly responsible for knocking out power to about one zero zero zero zero zero bay area customers this summer that could be repeated citing data from the national weather service an organization that monitors power supplies throughout the region _ the western systems coordinating council _ issued a report friday that predicted abovenormal warmth across the west whats it all add up to even if pge eventually manages to

davis took to the airwaves thursday to explain how california was going to solve its energy troubles pge corp chairman robert glynn was one of the few who knew that things were about to get much much worse without telling the governor and contrary to later explanations glynn had decided days earlier that pacific gas and electric co would file for bankruptcy protection friday morning sources within the utility said moreover the timing of the move now seems to have been very deliberate pge observers say seized the opportunity to declare bankruptcy friday so it could lay blame on the governor while also staying ahead of a breakthrough in davis separate bailout talks with southern california edison a deal that worked against pges financial interests the behindthescenes picture taking shape is that pge apparently realized that it had no choice but to act on friday after months of bankruptcy preparations this was the companys best chance to minimize backlash from the filing and pge scrambled to have everything in place before the governor uttered a word however thats not how glynn and other pge officials told the story we listened carefully to the governors statement and the commentary that followed and this decision is the result glynn said friday of why pge had chosen to file for bankruptcy davis felt hed been ambushed the governor called glynn on friday night and expressed his deep disappointment over pges actions sources said the call did not go well and that a possibly insurmountable gulf had opened up between the states top politician and the head of its largest utility the governor was led to believe that we were dealing in good faith and clearly that was not the case steve maviglio davis spokesman said yesterday instead of looking in the mirror they pointed fingers as glynn told it pges talks with davis had broken down weeks earlier weve heard a lot of the words that have been involved but have not seen a lot of actions he said by last week the deal slowly taking shape between the utility and the state had ballooned to almost incomprehensible complexity what once had been a mere cash infusion for a troubled company now involved public acquisition of power lines and land changes in californias regulatory laws multibilliondollar bond offerings and potentially huge rate increases for consumers financial analysts who had been briefed on the status of the negotiations after the governors thursday speech said it appeared that davis was ready to do virtually anything to keep pge from going bankrupt pge smelled weakness but they said pge may have sensed that the governor had lost the political clout to sell to lawmakers what was shaping up to be a very generous deal although a reasonable deal could have been reached its unclear whether all the parties in the state would have signed on said paul patterson an energyindustry analyst at credit suisse first boston in new york sources familiar with the talks said the negotiations reached an impasse last month when pge demanded that the state public utilities commission be reorganized so that it would have less oversight authority over the utilitys activities such a change would have given pge almost free rein to raise its one three million customers rates any time the utility saw fit the sources said one called pges demand a deal breaker pge spokesman ron low denied yesterday that such a condition had been sought rather he said pge merely wanted written assurance that any agreement reached with the governor could not be undone by the puc other sources cited a different turning point in the negotiations they said the talks began to disintegrate several weeks ago when davis criticized pge and other utilities for not making payments to smaller power companies that were struggling to get by it is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the money the governor said its immoral and has to stop pges chief financial officer peter darbee reportedly told one of davis negotiators that glynn took it personally when pge was called immoral whatever the reason glynn knew well before the governors speech on thursday that his utility was going to file for bankruptcy filing ready to go we had this thing ready to go long before that acknowledged pge spokesman greg pruett indeed pge had hired bankruptcy attorneys from the new york firm of weil gotshal manges last august although the lawyers ostensibly had been retained to help keep the utility from going bankrupt their mission shifted as pge sank deeper into debt by early this year sources within the utility said the attorneys had drawn up all necessary papers to file for bankruptcy at a moments notice the only question was the timing many observers now believe that pge never intended to cut a bailout deal with the governor the utility made no secret of its displeasure with having to sell off lucrative assets like power lines land or dams moreover pge executives appeared to sincerely believe that they were entitled to recoup the entire nine billion in debt accrued because of a rate freeze that prevented the utility from passing along skyhigh power costs to customers they had faith in a lawsuit pending in federal court that seeks to overturn the rate freeze and allow full recovery of past expenses but time was against pge the utilitys southern california cousin edison was holding its own bailout talks with davis and unlike pge had found the terms of the deal to its liking in february edison reached a tentative accord with the governor to sell its transmission lines to the state for nearly two eight billion now the negotiators say a final deal may be just a few days away including an agreement for edison to drop its own lawsuit seeking recovery of past costs edison deal posed problems if so this would have been a big headache for pge among other problems it would have been an enormous challenge to say the least to publicly defend pursuit of its federal lawsuit when edison had announced that such legal tactics were unnecessary its possible they would be seen as a spoiler if edison has a deal in place and then pge filed for bankruptcy said cs first bostons patterson theyd been looking at bankruptcy for months he also said they looked at the political landscape and decided this was the best way to go the looming edison deal added extra urgency to pges bankruptcy timing if pge waited until this week to file it risked the governor announcing a final agreement with edison as early as tomorrow observers said that risk as well as the opportunity for fingerpointing provided by davis thursday night speech gave pge almost no choice but to schedule its bankruptcy filing for friday morning once the filing date had been settled on pge set the bankruptcy wheels in motion these things take time to put together from the moment you decide to do it said pge spokesman pruett bonus handouts among other considerations glynn wanted to hand out bonuses and raises to about six zero zero zero managers and other employees at the utility and its parent company such a move would be more difficult after the bankruptcy filing had been made the bankruptcy judge could even forbid it backtracking from a previous decision not to hand out bonuses this year glynn told pge workers in an internal memo late thursday that he had changed his mind bonuses and raises would be awarded he said because of workers efforts teamwork and dedication during the past year and particularly throughout the ongoing energy crisis next pge had to orchestrate the actual filing and its subsequent fallout securities regulators were informed that the company had an important announcement pending and trading in pges stock was immediately halted employees were informed of the bankruptcy move in an email message sent out at nine three zero am followed by a town hallstyle meeting in the corporate auditorium one five minutes later glynn and gordon smith pges chief executive then spoke by telephone with reporters followed by a full day of oneonone interviews to hammer home the companys message criticism of negotiators in one such interview glynn reiterated to cnbc that the governors negotiators have moved away from previous agreements that we had reached with them he also faulted state regulators for having taken negative actions that jeopardized pges financial position an unusual argument for a utility already nine billion in the hole meanwhile the companys spinmeisters issued talking points for employees so they too could communicate pges stance it advised them to say bankruptcy was in the best interests of our customers employees suppliers debt holders and shareholders going forward pge has two weeks in which to compile all the necessary paperwork supporting its filing and will then schedule subsequent developments with federal bankruptcy judge dennis montali the process which could last years ultimately will provide a framework for pges creditors to recover at least a portion of the money owed them and will allow the utility to continue operating in an otherwise normal manner pge said it foresees no disruptions of service or layoffs of employees rates could skyrocket however customers rates could go through the roof if the bankruptcy judge decides that consumers should shoulder the utilitys nine billion debt burden in the meantime pge is continuing efforts to persuade customers to use less power in the face of severe electricity shortages this summer including tv ads promoting conservation one such ad is scheduled to run in the bay area tonight during a showing of the ten commandments in which moses leads his people through the desert and to the promised land glynn now leading his company through the wilderness of

haunt him source chronicle staff writers byline carla marinucci patrick hoge body in january gov gray davis stood before the legislature for his state of the state address and delivered a definitive vow and a devastating prediction to utilities and the financial community let me say this i reject the irresponsible notion that we can afford to allow our major utilities to go bankrupt he said our fate is tied to their fate davis painted a chaotic picture of what could follow bankruptcy would mean that millions of californians would be subject to electricity blackouts public safety would be jeopardized businesses would close jobs would be lost investment would flee the state and our economy would suffer a devastating blow but on friday the event davis called unthinkable came to pass as the states largest utility declared bankruptcy just hours after the governor delivered his first televised address to the state on the energy crisis the dramatic move by pacific gas and electric co that many saw as a slap in davis face highlighted what critics say are the california governors worst political liabilities an overly cautious controlling nature and a tendency to focus on protecting political turf with easy promises in this situation it meant davis promised no rate increases for consumers while pursuing a bailout strategy to force the utility to give up one of its prized assets its network of transmission lines most men never have a chance to write their own epitaphs but gray provided the language for his political gravestone said gop consultant dan schnur a former top aide to davis predecessor republican pete wilson he did it all by himself davis defenders say the governor deserves credit during the past months of the states energy crisis for steadfastly seeking a plan that would protect average california consumers davis does get some points for fighting off the rate increase for awhile said bruce cain political science professor at the university of california at berkeley bob mulholland campaign adviser to the state democratic party said the governor is the captain in a classic battle between democratic populism and the big oilandenergy interests who control wholesale electricity prices the texas boys have california right where they want us he said pge declares chapter one one bankruptcy while theyre eating filet mignons others however say davis has singlemindedly pursued unrealistic options that have caused delay and greater financial fallout they point to davis insistence since january that pge sell its transmission lines in exchange for cash to pay off its debts an option the company always disliked southern california edison in late february signed a tentative two eight billion deal to sell its transmission lines and some speculate that davis hoped pge would cave in and do the same despite its reluctance pge officials said they agreed to sell the lines in a handshake deal with a top davis negotiator in late february but the state quickly backed away from the deal said dan richard a pge senior vice president at the same time richard said the governor was publicly chastising the utility for its actions and the daviscontrolled public utilities commission was issuing rulings the company felt jeopardized its economic survival pge corp chairman robert glynn said that for the three critical weeks in march pge had no negotiations at all with the davis administration finally on march two seven glynn called the governor and spoke with davis warning him that the firm was as close as it ever had been to filing bankruptcy a top davis negotiator last monday requested that pge officials come to sacramento for a meeting and another davis adviser told the company it would probably not like what was being offered richard said pge representatives were presented with a proposal they felt was a major step back richard said despite pges displeasure on wednesday davis met with the assembly republican caucus and reported that negotiations with pge were going well according to legislators at the meeting when asked davis reportedly downplayed the possibility of bankruptcy proceedings davis in touch it makes you want to consider whether or not the governors office is really in touch with the crisis said jamie fisfis a spokesman for assembly republican leader dave cox rfair oaks davis own declarations have eroded his credibility fisfis said no rate increases no bankruptcies fisfis said those things have come to pass said assemblyman keith richman rnorthridge the governor was strongly focused on the political expediency of not raising rates and was taking a stance that was completely unrealistic davis micromanaging style also allowed for no bipartisan cooperation fisfis said he didnt really give us an opportunity to participate or assist because he kept everything secret fisfis said even some in davis own party have become increasingly vocal in their criticism arithmetic faulty assemblyman dean florez dshafter said the arithmetic laid out in the governors proposals apparently did not add up for pge providing neither enough money to buy power in the future nor to pay off its debt florez who has sponsored a bill to help utilities pay off past debts said legislators probably will begin pursuing their own proposals some of which were shelved to give the governor a chance to do it his way davis may have locked himself in too early by saying we can do this without a rate increase florez said that is what made this thing really impossible to deal with garry south davis senior political adviser argued that critics should focus their wrath not on davis but on the arrogance and greed of big utilities the governor cannot hold a gun to pges temple and force them to a deal said south he is only one player in this drama and unfortunately he doesnt control most of the other players in the most recent negotiations south said pge demanded that davis basically agree to all of their conditions forgive all their past debts forget the fact that they brought this thing on themselves by supporting deregulation bail them out with the taxpayers money and hold them harmless south insisted that consumers understand the governors standing with the public has held up he said because people view him as having the interests of the consumer at heart of not caving into big utility companies voters patience unknown critics say the real question is how much patience voters will have for davis who faces reelection in one nine months as the crisis unfolds but ucs cain said davis is still a strong favorite for reelection because of the weakness of the opposition and the inability of republicans to say theyve got a better idea and davis two six million war chest will buy a lot of

commission state law says no nuclear plants may be built until a safe way to dispose of nuclear waste is found while there is no legal reason duke couldnt build coalfired facilities in california the nuclear option is unlikely right now that could change if the radioactive waste problem were solved or deemphasized due to the need for more power the winds seem to be shifting politically im sure theyre considering their options said barbara puklin silverman an energy analyst for arnold s bleichroeder of new york duke claims to obey rules company spokeswoman cathy roche said duke will rely on natural gas to fuel three of its california plants a fourth in oaklands inner harbor runs on diesel she dismissed attacks on dukes plutonium project as the criticism of a very small group of antinuclear activists who will go as far as they can to shut down that option roche said blame for air pollution in the southeast should be laid on the auto industry other industries and power plants in other states particularly those in tennessee she pointed to honors duke has won from financial publications and its consistently high customersatisfaction ratings we do very tenaciously defend our record when we have complied with the rules roche said with reference to dukes reputation for litigiousness when challenged or resisted by regulators and private citizens a reputation that hasnt dimmed its luster on wall street the company has been one of the bestregarded builders and operators of power plants in the country and one of the early movers in the merchant energy business created

stable breathing problems they had before with severe asthma and emphysema ballantine said were seeing more lung disease than when i came here four years ago ballantine added my opinion is the

coastal alliance but its spoiled having to live with duke and the people they bought off oconnell said any attempt to link any contribution to my position on the ballot measure is absurd and laughable the project is sound were in an energy crisis a clear majority in the community understands that but mccurdys group claims the plant fueled by natural gas will put an additional seven six tons of particulate matter into the air an amount equivalent to more than three zero zero percent of all emissions produced each year by diesel buses in the bay area particulates are particles small enough to enter and lodge in the lungs mccurdy said health hazards to children who will be attending school close to the new facility will increase water quality will deteriorate and marine life will die the bay is one of three california estuaries protected by the clean water acts national estuary program the coastal alliance calls the plant there now a moral and ethical abomination and contends duke wants to make a bad situation significantly worse they have sought and pretty much succeeded in making morro bay a company town said mccurdy a retired los angeles times reporter with the assistance of santa barbaras environmental defense center a publicinterest legal group the coastal alliance plans to fight dukes morro bay expansion project before the california energy commission as it proceeds through the review process this year duke says the morro bay project will meet all the requirements of state and federal law and use the best available technology to lower smog levels a putrid halo epting the environmental commissioner is a pilot who flies a small plane over the central part of north carolina you can see an orangishyellow plume that connects these plants its a putrid halo that sits over the top of chapel hill raleigh greensboro and charlotte thats what these companies give us he said but state regulators have not found much to complain about at least with regard to duke environmentalists say thats because they havent looked hard enough nobody here is doing anything about this said janet zeller of the blue ridge environmental defense league in glendale springs nc north carolina airquality official mike aldrich contended that wasnt the case sometimes theyll make you make them do it right aldrich said of duke but they will do it right the federal governments experience has been different in december the justice department took duke to court on behalf of the epa which had failed to persuade the company to bring its eight coalfired plants in the carolinas into compliance with the clean air act the government charged duke with more than five zero violations punishable by fines upward of two five zero zero zero a day saying the company had gone at least a decade without installing costly equipment to control powerplant emissions containing sulfur dioxide nitrogen dioxides and particulates while the suits ultimate fate may be uncertain under the bush

construction under a contract with the federal energy departments national nuclear security agency is scheduled to begin in two zero zero three operations are expected to continue through two zero two two when the lethal leftovers of the nuclear arms race have been consumed roche said the company has a good record on its nuclear operations and was invited to run the mox program because the government has confidence in it but critics call the project economically and environmentally risky as well as a magnet for terrorists because recycled plutonium can be converted back to weaponsgrade materiel with relative ease its going to be a fiasco said mills the duke shareholder a onetime electrician on a nuclear submarine who inherited stock and uses it as a paper pulpit for his cleanenergy

back to ldc good morning jeff catherine is out of the office until tuesday three two zero zero one not wanting to keep you waiting for a reply i thought it best to give you some feedback immediately the great majority of cads customers in ca are core cad does not knowingly terminate any current customer prior to their expiration date the reasons why cads customers are turned back to the utility are as follows one upon receiving renewal pricing from the cad rep the customer chooses to return to the utility two understanding that the current minimum margin per meter for our customers is approximately three zero zero those customers that have extremely low annual volumes are sent attrition letters and turned back to the ldc at the end of their contract we cannot competitively price this type of customer versus the utility and extract enough margin to support them currently in the california markets pge sdge socal there exists approximately five zero customers that have usages so low that given current market conditions we will not choose to renew the contracts the expiration dates for these are between five three zero two zero zero one and two two eight two zero zero five three the customer initiates a request for termination prior to the end of their contractual expiration date as we are all aware california customers specifically those with either an index or nymex product experienced a large swing in their pricing during the past few months cad has been inundated with customers requesting to be returned to their ldc although we seek to satisfy our customer to the best of our ability returning these customers to the utility is the last thing we want to do the steps we have taken to address this issue is to a work with customer servicecredit to offer extended payment options to ease the effect of the increase b offer to restructure the customers contract and reprice the customer on a fixed price product minimizing their risk going forward c explain to the customer in more detail the reasons why this has occurred and how going forward the indexnymex pricing has eased should you have additional questions please reply or call jim from jeff

smithhoueesees subject more inquiries from ca puc re switching customers back to ldc greetings recall that about three weeks we got a call from a ca puc staffer asking whether wed switched a particular gas customer or two back to the ldc we looked into it and discovered that wed mistakenly switched the customer back due to a mix up about the fact that the customer had two active meters behind two different utilities we informed the puc staffer of the mixup and explained that the situation would be resolved the questions from the staffer arose because the ca puc made a bad decision a couple of months ago when gas prices ran up at the california border a lot of large noncore customers attempted to switch back to the utility tariff in the hope of lowering gas costs in response socalgas filed with the commission asking the puc to prohibit customers from switching back the commission agreed and put the prohibition in place the commission is now concerned that if suppliers terminate their contracts with customers for whatever reason or choose not to renew the contracts when they expire customers wont have the option of returning to ldc service today i received a letter from the president of the commission asking me to respond to the following have you stopped selling and delivering natural gas to any noncore customers with whom you have an existing procurement contract ornotified any of your noncore customers that you do not intend to renew an existing natural gas commodity procurement contract if your company has stopped or intends to stop serving noncore customers the cpuc also needs to know how many contracts you have terminated or expect to terminate the natural gas volumes involved the location of the noncore customers the reasons your company intends or has already acted to terminate those contracts theres a good chance that the letter from the president of the commission is linked to the fact that weve recently switched our electricity customers back to utility service in california prior to deciding whether and how to respond to the commissioner im trying to get handle on whether were resourcing any gas retail customers to the utility prior to expiration choosing not to renew contracts once theyve expired etc catherine or jim foster can you help out thanks best jeff,02:29:00,No

zero over the past several weeks there have been several articles in the trade p ress about how the wholesale markets for natural gas and electricity where enron holds a commanding two five market share have been unaffected by the c risis enfolding the houston trading giant enron was having no trouble duri ng october finding counterparties for its trades so not to worry there wa s no lack of liquidity plaguing the market gas prices were responding nor mally to supply and demand fundamentals so the rosy scenario observers we re saying anyway excuse us novembers bid week price was a full seven zero over octobers and we can find no earthly fundamental reason for that surge this had nothing to do with fundamental supply and demand the weather during october was warm storage was chockfull so much so that little could be injected because c avern pressures were too high sure there was a lot of weather hype about a cold winter coming but that was only a forecast that was meaningless ev en if it came true because the winter would have to be seven eight colder than no rmal just to burn up the three seven five billion cubic feet bcf surplus already in st orage to get next aprils inventories in line with last aprils levels an ybody could see that surplus was also due to get much bigger by the end of november because there were huge seven zero nine zero bcf weekly withdrawals last year due to the fact that month was bitterly cold in two zero zero zero two zero in face of all those bearish facts which could have been willing to bid ca sh prices up at spot for most of october then bid them up even higher duri ng the last week which was bid week for november we are talking about obl igations that committed the buyers for baseload supply for the entire month of november not just a spot price for a day or two of swing supply no b ig storage arbitrage game eithertwo zero no the cash market strength couldnt be explained by the arbitrage game of buying cash gas cheap injecting it into storage and then shorting the out months futures to lock in a margin there wasnt much of a gap between th e november screen index and cash prices most cash deals went at index minu s a few cents during october true there was a nice gap between cash and t he december futures screen but there was not much chance to profit by this storage was so full that little volume could have been injected during oc tobertwo zero so if someone says the price surge that month was all due to the expected workings of supply and demand we would have to ask him what he was smokin g sunspots would have been a more likely explanation lack of confidence i n enron as a counterparty is a more likely explanationtwo zero a better idea emerges after we note that spot prices continued high into no vember in spite of continued record breaking warmth henry hub cash tags reached three two four on friday nov two then that all reversed suddenly on nov seven nine which was just when serious rumors that dynegy was going to buy enron an d put it out of its misery began and then became fact by presstime last w ednesday nov one four a mere one week later the henry hub had collapsed a ll the way to two two nine and was still falling like a stone getting back to w here it should have been all october can this be just a coincidencetwo zero we think it likely that the reason prices were not that low in october is t hat with rumors of enron troubles circulating the wholesale market had bee n given a flat tire by a fear of a potential lack of liquidity there could have been a perceived need for somebody with a better credit rating to bac k up the enron traders who took the opposite side of one trade in four nati onally in fact recent news reports say that after the first reports of en rons problems emerged in midoctober there was a falloff in the willingne ss of commercial users of gas and electricity as well to buy fixed price supply contracts with enron because the firms corporate credit risk hampe red its ability to hedge its obligations how comfortable would you feel s igning a fixedprice deal with a company with no assets of its own to produ ce your gas or generate your power and whose ability to obtain those suppl ies via futures or swaps was eroded because its credit was on the verge of being downgraded to junk an energy banker asked this could have favored the long side of the markettwo zero in normal circumstances consumers such as utilities could almost have stay ed out of the november bid week cash market backed as they were by huge st orage and warm weather instead they must have bought heavily perhaps fear ing that with enron sick there wouldnt be enough counterparty weight to ta ke the other side and supply them later if they stayed short the fear coul d have been that over the counter swaps to hedge later spot purchases might just not be available on enron online the way they usually are other trad ers might not have been able to take up the slack since they trade often w ith enron commercial players might have perceived them as being infected w ith some of the same weaknesstwo zero after the dynegy deal was announced however prices could have been freed to fall back to where they were at the end of september with users now una fraid to play the short side because enron was back in business with a bett er credit rating by nov one four with cash prices more than one below where the y were during bid week enron spokesman eric thode said volumes on enron online have returned to the normal range the three zero

market confidence that points to a correlation of falling prices and a revived enron they dont speak german at enron do theytwo zero if so what happened to gas prices last month could have been the mirror im age of the metallgesellschaft ag induced crisis on the oil futures market in early one nine nine four that crisis pushed oil prices down instead of shoving gas pr ices up this german firm a trader and user of oil had used a very aggres sive strategy to obtain its supplies of oil in order to lock in a price fo r the coming year the germans stacked all their contracts covering their oil needs for the coming year as long positions on the near month they wo uld go to delivery on just the portion they needed for the next four weeks then would roll the rest of the contracts onto the next futures month t hey did that by selling the remainder of the expiring months contracts and using the money to buy the same number of the next months contracts but to be sure of being able to do that without losing their lederhosen the ge rmans had to be sure that the next months contracts would be cheaper than the prompt month ones they had just sold well due to last minute purchase s by consumers going to delivery the prompt month usually is higher than t he next one so the germans thought they had a strategy that would guarante e them a profit every month when they flipped their futures stack a nice k icker on top of having locked in the underlying cost of the oil they would use for the year yeah right well one month that didnt happen mostly b ecause other traders got wind of what the germans were doing and decided to hold their feet to the fire by bidding up the next month which is a varia nt of what happened to long term capital management four years later so losing

those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatthour were a canadian public utility a subsidiary of san diego gas electrics parent company and the los angeles department of water and power the report shows their average prices ranged from four nine eight a megawatthour charged by powerex the trading arm of british columbias bc hydro to two nine two an hour by the dwp in fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by davis and other state officialsdynegy inc duke energy and mirantcharged less than the average prices the state paid for the period those companies average prices ranged from one four six to two four zero per megawatthour according to an analysis of the documents the figures cover the various types of spot and longerterm power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razorthin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies davis spokesman steve maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private outofstate generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period you have to look at the whole picture maviglio said the governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said their profits were one zero zero to four zero zero above last year just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatthour doesnt change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from houston tulsa atlanta or charlotte the report by the department of water resources was provided to the times on the same day the state released one seven zero zero pages of documents on californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the years first quarter the records detail how the state spent nearly eight billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the states energy problem they also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators oscar hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year all the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in midjanuary the average price per megawatthour for all state purchases went from three one six in january to two four three in may spot prices fell from an average of three two one per hour to two seven one the reports show in the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies for example houstonbased enron one of the nations biggest power traders charged an average of one eight one per megawatthour and atlantabased mirant which sold the most to the state a total of seven zero six million charged an average of two two five per megawatthour by contrast a calgary canada firm transalta energy averaged three three five a megawatthour and the sacramento municipal utility district had average charges of three three zero per megawatthour a spokesman for enron mark palmer said recently that the vilification of enron was based on politics not facts spokesmen for bc hydro could not be reached late monday to comment on its huge sales to the state in the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered lastminute hydroelectric power that helped keep californias lights on a spokeswoman for sempra the parent company of san diego gas electric said late monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state officials at dwp who could not be reached monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high more power bought than projected hidalgo of the department of water resources said his agencys efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market still the state had to purchase three two one million in power in april and may about one zero more than davis analysts had projected hidlago said that was because of hot weather in may and other supply problems in april he said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in june and early july the reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in june and july partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under one zero zero a megawatthour a summary

subject government affairs organizational changes fyi attached is a memo from rick shapiro outlining organizational changes in the government affairs group most significantly the appointment of a new head of the washington office this is a great time to be at enron the challenges and opportunities at enron seem to be expanding with every passing day this presents enormous challenges for government affairs as a group and for each of us individually as we discussed at the staff meeting last month this requires us to constantly reevaluate our priorities our methods of getting things done and whether our organization is properly structured to meet the needs of the entire company while we have done an outstanding job as a group within our current structure changes are necessary at this time the primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the assignments for and reinforce the leadership roles of the individuals within the group who have primary responsibility for setting the government affairs strategy and agenda for the respective enron operating companies the below mentioned individuals will have the following responsibilities one enron north america and enron industrial markets jim steffes two the enron energy services group of companies harry kingerski three enron broadband services sue nord four enron global markets and enron networks lisa yoho five enron south america jose bestard six federal government affairs linda robertson with the impending retirement on march three one two zero zero one of joe hillings i am pleased to announce that linda robertson will be joining the office on november six two zero zero zero as a vice president who will immediately assume responsibility for leading the federal government affairs group in our washington office linda was a congressional staffer and partnerprincipal in two washington law firms prior to spending the last eight years with the us department of treasury the last five as assistant secretary for legislative affairs and public liaison for secretaries rubin summers linda brings a terrific background both in energy and financial services and is a welcome addition to our team in order to more effectively integrate the government affairs groups and strategy in washington the federal regulatory affairs group under joe hartsoes direction will also report to linda joe hartsoe will also retain primary responsibility for nerc activities although charles yeung and dick ingersoll will have a dotted line reporting relationship to jim steffes in his capacity of directing our activities for ena ray alvarez will be transferring from his current role with transredes in bolivia during the one st quarter of two zero zero one and will join the federal regulatory affairs group reporting to joe hartsoe on a personal note i would like to acknowledge the significant contributions that joe hillings has made to this company in his eighteen years of service joes work ethic intellect and integrity have established enron as a company that is respected throughout washington i will have more to say about this as joes retirement draws closer but i look to him to be a vital part of the leadership transition in our washington office that will occur over the next days and weeks i will be relying heavily on the aboveidentified six individuals to ensure that government affairs is firmly embedded within each of our operating companies that we as a group thoroughly understand their current business strategies as well as new directions they may be taking in the future and most importantly to thoroughly understand how our organization can contribute and add value to each of these companies on a continuing basis communicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the government affairs organization and developing a government affairs wide execution strategy will be a key objective for each of these individuals in order to ensure the success of these individuals and the government affairs organization the following changes are being made in addition to his leadership role with government affairs on behalf of the ees group of companies harry kingerski will continue to head up the ratesregulatory group now renamed government affairs support services this group will continue to provide valuable technical support services throughout government affairs and will be expanding its scope of expertise over the next months to some of the new markets that the company has and will soon be entering nancy hetrick and vinio floris will join this organization and report to harry jeff brown tom delaney mary hain ron mcnamara christi nicolay thane twiggs and steve walton will now report to jim steffes in his role supporting enron north

in leading the cubr coalition for uniform business rules process over the last year and his current leadership of the midwest iso and alliance rto efforts for enron will be critical to the development of well functioning wholesale electric markets in the us it is also my hope that steve walton will play an increased leadership role across north america on wholesale electric market issues the incredible knowledge that steve walton possesses of the electric industry coupled with his industrywide credibility will provide much needed support to our wholesale electric market reform efforts across north america tom hoatson will now report to steve montovano in his new role in supporting the companys efforts at pjm tom will also continue to be an organizationwide resource on technical issues regarding generation interconnection and distributed generation kathleen sullivan has recently joined steves group from azurix and will be primarily assisting howard fromer in new york sue nord

eight five seven am to bob shultshouectect daniel diamondhouectect cc subject from todays ngi enrononline market power under fire the simmering pot of market concerns regarding the market power of enrononline finally boiled over in public yesterday at chicagos ldc forum a representative from enrononline had to fend off verbal attacks from competitors and from the audience who criticized the system as giving enron the ability to manipulate prices and provide it with an unfair advantage over competitors scott coleman an official at altra energy technologies said proprietary systems like enrononline and systems being developed by a consortium of large market players represent a danger to the health of the energy industry because of their current or potential market power altrade operates its own independent online exchange that is one of enrons biggest electronic competitors it differs from enononline in that various buyers and sellers trade with each other with altrade serving to clear the transactions on enrononline enron posts bid and asked prices and is a party in every transaction the proprietary enrononline trading system has been accused of market manipulation mainly because of its tremendous growth since going live last november and because of the market strength of its operator enron corp enron is the energy industrys largest marketertraderrisk manager and one of the largest natural gas pipeline operators about six zero of its marketing and trading business today is done over the enrononline system critics charged that enrononline provides a tremendous advantage to its parent because all of the transaction data is thrown into a historical database that is available only to enron enrononline has handled more than two eight zero zero zero zero transactions worth one four zero billion since going live the proprietary system handles about two zero zero zero transactions every day with a value estimated at one billion and most of its online business is natural gas and power sales and purchases why has the system been so successful its free easy to use low risk and there is a tight bidask spread both enrononline and its competitors note theres no special hardware required everything is on the web and a transaction is as simple as a couple clicks of the mouse it also provides a broad variety of information including prices on one zero zero zero products and is supported by the largest energy marketing firm although there are many other systems out there few if any have the content ease of use and price discovery of enrononline critics claimed that power enables enrononline to soak up liquidity in the marketplace and in doing so give itself a tremendous advantage over its competitors with each trade enron gains a little bit more information about its competitors positions in the market over the long term i think the market will always correct itself said altras coleman but in the short term i think if any one player has enough of a presence in any one market they can cause prices to move in one direction or another enrononline director bob shults said the company is simply providing a service for our customers particularly a bid and ask but i dont think enron has the ability to move markets we are just putting a bid and ask out there and if people want to buy at our prices then fine if people want to sell at our prices fine then sell it i dont think we have the market manipulation capability people suspect we are not bigger than the marketplace when asked specifically about historical data collected on those who use the system shults denied the company studies the buying and selling patterns of its competitors with an eye toward manipulation sort of the big brother of the energy marketplace the historical information is not available enrononlines shults admitted we just started calculating the indices and price reports we are now providing that information to the market so everyone else has that information as well he said enron does not retain information about those who use its system shults did however warn that the system will make the us energy market much more closely connected to the global marketplace in the future with increasing demand for lng imports and rapid price discovery of worldwide commodities on enrononline for example market activity in africa and the far east could have a more immediate impact on domestic markets quoting analysis conducted by forester research inc shults also predicted electronic exchange revenues could grow from five zero zero billion

the outstanding class of offensive line recruits in the state this year came to texas saturday with his parents and committed to the longhorns he is texas one two th commitment and that group includes seven offensive linemen young who already is a full qualifier with a nine eight zero sat and two one act score said he also had scholarship offers from miami ucla notre dame arkansas texas am lsu mississippi state and several other schools but he said he has been a texas fan for some time and decided to commit when he was offered a scholarship by coach mack brown saturday he said he met with brown and assistant coaches darryl drake and tim nunez drake recruits the longview area and nunez is the offensive line coach when asked what he feels his strong points are as an offensive lineman young said he has worked hard to get quicker and feels he has a quick initial charge he said the texas coaches told him they like the way he makes quick contact and holds his blocks i really like texas he said they have great coaches and great kids and they are going to do some great things in the next few years and i want to be part of it longview coach pat collins who coached an ncaa division ii national title team at northeast louisiana a few years ago has seen some top football players and he says young is one of the best high school prospects i have seen or coached he has worked really hard this summer and has excellent mobility and agility hes a great prospect and a great kid who has really supportive parents for those of you who are disturbed by youngs four zero time dont worry about it he has a very quick start for such a big man and was adept at picking off speed rushers from his offensive tackle spot as a junior collins told me he is moving young to guard because he is a really physical blocker and i want to us to be able to run inside better he can help the team more at guard but he could play guard or tackle in college the states top qb prospect matt nordgren six five two one seven four six two of dallas bishop lynch was scheduled to go to texas am this weekend for an unofficial visit with his coach gary oliver a former aggie receiver but i talked to nordgren today sunday and he told he didnt get to go to am because oliver wasnt able to go he said he planned to take a quick trip to colorado but i didnt go to either place i dont think im going to be able to go to colorado now because coach oliver and i probably will go to am next weekend and then well be starting twoadays asked if he is getting close to a decision nordgren said i really like texas and i dont think that is going to change i dont think anyone is going to beat texas i will be very surprised if he doesnt commit to texas immediately after returning from his am visit texas

walks by on the way to the alamodome again we hoot and holler like wildmen again the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us this time however with the nebraska fight songs although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of nebraska one three zero i begin the walk to the alamodome somehow managing to stuff the traveler and one one cans of beer into my pants one four seven i am in line surrounded by nebraska fans they are taunting me i am taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of nebraska i decide to challenge a particularly vocal nebraska fan to play what i now call and will forever be remembered as cellphone flop out remember flop out for a dollar the rules are similar i tell this nebraska jackass that if hes so confident in his team he should flop out his cell phone right now and make plane reservations to phoenix for the fiesta bowl and then i spoke these memorable words and not those damn refundable tickets either you request those nonrefundable nontransferrable sonsofbitches he backs down he is unworthy i call southwest airlines and buy two tickets to phoenix nonrefundable and nontransferrable price seven one two he is humbled he lowers his head in shame i raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of texas fans i am king and these are my subjects i distribute the one one beers in my pants to the cheering masses i rule the pregame kingdom two three four kickoff brimming with confidence i open the traveler and pour my first stiffy two four five i notice something troubling nebraska is big nebraska is fast nebraska is very pissed off at texas three zero one the first quarter mercifully ends nine yards total offense for texas zero first downs for texas im still talking shit i pour another stiffy from the traveler three three six four minutes to go in the first half the traveler is a dead soldier i buy my first five beer from the alamodome merchants while i am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates major applewhite and rolls out of the end zone safety three five six halftime score nebraska one five texas zero i wish i had another traveler four one one while urinating next to a nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime i attempt to revive the classic briceism from the south bend bathroom hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock he is unamused four two one i buy my two nd and three rd five beer from the alamodome merchants i share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka i send them off to purchase sprites so that we may consume their vodka i have not lost faith nebraska is a bunch of pussies four five one no more vodka the girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives i purchase two more five beers from the alamodome merchants five one eight score is nebraska two two texas zero i am beginning to lose faith this normally would trouble me but i am too drunk to see the football field five two seven i call southwest airlines im sorry sir those tickets have been confirmed and are nonrefundable and nontransferrable five three seven i try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter as it turns out the alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than one zero minutes on the game clock i am enraged by this policy i ask loudly why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the fucking pa system five four nine back in my seats i am slumped in my chair in defeat all of a sudden the texas crowd goes absolutely nuts whazzis i mutter awaking from my coma iz we winnig did wez scort alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score the largest by far cheer of the day from the texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and bevo the texas mascot stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters s k and a in the nebraska spelled out in their end zone i cheer wildly i pick up the empty traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it i am thirsty six one six nebraska fans are going berserk as i walk back to the truck i would taunt them with some offcolor remarks about their parentage but i am too drunk to form complete sentences with my last cognitive thought of the evening i take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in october they would be playing florida state for the national championship six three zero back in the car on the way back to austin for the basketball game eight zero zero texasarizona tip off we can still salvage the day i crack open a beer it is warm i dont care seven one two we have stopped for gas i am hungry i go inside the store i walk past the beer frig i notice a zima ive never had a zima i wonder if its any good i pull a zima from the frig i twist the top off and drink the zima in three swallows zima sucks i replace the empty bottle in the frig seven one seven there is a blimpie subs in the store i walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub there is no one there i lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives i eat them i am still hungry i lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of pastrami i walk out of the store grunting and eating pastrami the patrons in the store fear me i dont care eight zero one we are in south austin i have been drinking warm beer and singing brooks and dunn tunes for over an hour my truckmate is tired of my singing he suggests that perhaps brooks and dunn have written other good songs besides youre going to miss me when im gone and neon moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive perhaps he suggests i could just let the cd play on its own i tell him to fuck off and restart neon moon eight three zero we arrive at the erwin center my truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage i tell him hes an idiot i tell him we will never get out i tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here he ignores me i think hes still pissed about the brooks and dunn tunes i whistle neon moon loudly eight four seven i am rallying i have four warm beers stuffed in my pants were going to kick the shit out of arizona nine one one halftime score texas three one arizona two nine i am pleased i go to the bathroom to pee for the six seven th time today i giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom brice there are no arizona fans in the bathroom i am disappointed i tell myself out loud that i have a niiiiiice cock no one is amused but me nine four one i walk to the bathroom while drinking bud light out of a can needless to say they do not sell beer at the erwin centermuch less bud light out of a can i am stopped by an usher where did you get that sir i tell him no shit oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs would you mind throwing this away for me i take the last swig and hand it to him he is confused i pretend im going to the bathroom but i run away giggling instead i duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me i sneak into a large group of people and sit down the usher walks by harmlessly i am giggling like a little girl i crack open another can of bud light nine five two i am lost in my haste to avoid the usher i have lost my bearings i have no ticket stub i cannot find my seats texas is losing one zero zero nine texas is being screwed by the refs i am enraged i have cleared out the seats around me because i keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it a concerned fan asks if im ok and perhaps i shouldnt take it so seriously i tell him to fuck off one zero one five after the fourth consecutive worst fucking call i have ever seen i attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects however on this occasion i miscalculate and i thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a onequarter inch gash over my eye i am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt perhaps i think to myself im taking this a bit seriously one zero two two i am standing in the bathroom peeing im so drunk i am swaying and grunting i have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye my pants are bloody i have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist i look like i should be in an episode of cops one zero four three texas has lost i put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits i am stopped every

markets at its special meeting today ferc released the results of its eagerly awaited probe into californias summer power crisis concluding that under certain circumstances california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to californias seriously flawed market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west the ferc staff report on western markets and the causes of the summer two zero zero zero price abormalities entitled part i of staff report on us bulk power markets is available at the following website httpwwwfercfeduselectricbulkpowerhtm in response ferc issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural changes to the california iso and px to help remedy the pricing problems and solicited public comment by november two two a technical conference has also been scheduled for november nine to discuss the proposed solutions and other remedies that might be suggested details tba while all four commissioners supported the order the order stretched the commission chairman hoecker and comm breathitt expressed strong endorsements while comms hebert and massey concurred citing areas where they felt the commission had either overreached or not gone far enough as discussed below a final order is expected to be issued by years end at the same time the commission warned california consumers of their continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve state issues such as one immediately implementing the availability of day ahead markets for power purchases two development of demand responses three siting of generation and transmission and four assurance of sufficient reserve requirements highlights of proposed california structural remedy in its order ferc proposed a series of market overhauls including one eliminating the states mandatory requirement that the states investorowned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px and allowing these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks two requiring market participants to schedule nine five percent of their transactions in the dayahead market and instituting a penalty charge for underscheduling in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements in order to discourage overreliance on the realtime spot market three establishing independent nonstakeholder governing boards for the iso and px four modifying the current single price auction system by a imposing a temporary one five zero mwh soft cap that prohibits supply bids in excess of one five zero from setting the marketclearing price for all bidders b requiring sellers bidding above one five zero mwh to report their bids to ferc on a confidential weekly basis and provide certain cost support and c requiring the iso and px to report monthly information on such bids the commissions price mitigation measures would remain in effect through december three one two zero zero two five declining to order retroactive refunds for the states ratepayers and utilities citing insufficient authority to do so but subjecting sellers to potential refund liability for transactions from october two two zero zero zero until december two one two zero zero two but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs if ferc finds noncompetitive behavior six encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand response management programs separately the draft order rejected the isos request for an extension of its current purchase price cap authority and the pxs request for price capping authority commissioner responses comm herbert reluctantly concurred noting that his decision may change when a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at the november nine meeting he stressed that he would have preferred that the order address four areas one eliminate all price controls in california markets two abolish the single price auction entirely three terminate the buy and sell mandate in the px and four direct the iso to address a long list of cited problems in its january two zero zero one rto filing rather than having the commission prescribe specific remedies hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the soft cap concept if one had to be adopted then the soft cap should increase incrementally increase over time at specific preannounced dates he believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive for california regulators to address market design and other flaws also he would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time but allow the iso and px to address this issue in their january two zero zero one rto filings in addition he would not dictate risk management methods preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on their own finally he advised californians not to be so environmentally focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation capacity comm breathitt stated her approval of the order while warning that ferc cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress towards open and competitive markets she noted that it was the commissions job to guide the market to selfcorrect and not to conduct command and control she also commended the managers of the iso and px saying that they have performed admirably however she noted she is awaiting comments on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential reporting requirements comm massey concurred but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive approach he feels that the congress has put its thumb on the scale in the federal power act to protect consumers stating that prices will continue to be unreasonable in the future he believes that this order moves in the right direction by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over reliance on the spot market lack of demand response the need to reconstitute governance of the iso and px and the elimination of the buysell mandate comm massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the one five zero mwh soft cap went far enough whether ferc has the legal authority to issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market price volatility finally chairman hoecker stated his strong support of the order but noted that this is no time to pull punches he emphasized that the commission needed frank comments from the industry he echoed comm breathitts warning that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on track noting that the commission lacked authority to order refunds he stated that the responsibility rests with congress addressing jurisdictional issues he stated that siting problems encountered at the state level are slowing the meandering transition to competition he feels that the state of california and ferc need to work together to resolve these problems and that ferc is not attempting to usurp power rather california is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region for reliable energy thus placing the burden on federal action to make things work hoecker maintained the chairman also said that the commission will fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further evidence provided by staffs ongoing investigation if you have any questions or comments please call jack cashin at two zero two five zero eight five four nine nine,08:58:00,No

zero zero one one zero three zero am to stokley chris cc richter jeff herndon rogers black don subject site profile consumption issues in our contracts chris as a follow up of our conversation here is a summary of contract issues i have tried to organize my comments into three major categories baseline bands and material change language where contracts were prior to site profile desk took control baseline not specified in contracts a variety of mechanisms to build baseline postcontract including calculating volumes on a forward basis ie first one two months last one two months prior to contract closing baseline volumes that grow by x bands annual nine zero one one zero bands aggregation at all levels including utility state and national etc material change language varied unclear or vague language at least in my opinion where we are now baseline two basic mechanisms intended to bring clarity major transactions ie any deal not priced from matrix volumes explicitly specified in contract minor transactions last one two months prior to contract closing with the understanding that origination will collect one two bills required for booking within days of contract closing process details to be finalized bands monthly nine zero one one zero bands aggregation allowed within same utilityvoltagefacility type groupings material change language unfortunately still unclear and inadequate see below for our proposals for example the where we want to be baseline minor transactions a process needs to be in place in services department to collect the one two bills required for booking within days of contract closing material change language this area needs to be really beefed up in my opinion material language should catch risks that are not explicitly modeled and priced at the moment i dont see material change language accomplishing this issue one protecting for long term shifts in consumption the nine zero one one zero consumption bands which are set on monthly basis we are offering right now are intended to provide normal weather and operating flexibility with this assumption we currently price consumption risk as a probabilistic process as opposed to pricing using the classic straddle approach simultaneous call put any step changes in consumption such as the limited adding additional display area or tyco health care products adding new production shifts violate this assumption i propose either one adding language that captures this steps or two price these steps explicitly given the lack of quality actual data the second alternative would be an educated guess at this point recently i proposed verbally to be fair the following language to jim wood productsorigination if a material change defined below has occurred eeso or customer may request that the commodity pricing be restructured to account for such material change a material change shall be any intentional or unintentional change including energy efficiency upgrades to the processes or operations conducted at any of the facilities or other similar occurrences that i change a facility accounts consumption of electricity or natural gas at such facility account by more than one zero of the facility accounts consumption baseline over any six consecutive months ie facility accounts actual consumption divided by facility accounts baseline consumption equals less than zero nine or more than one one or ii change a facility account s monthly onpeak usage ratio for electricity at such facility account by more than five of facility accounts monthly onpeak usage ratio baseline over any six consecutive months the facility account monthly onpeak usage ratio equals the monthly onpeak facility account usage divided by the total monthly facility account usage jims immediate reaction was mixed he felt that customers may feel that we are giving them volumetric flexibility on one hand and taking it back with the other he said eight zero one two zero on material change may be more palatable issue two sudden load swings in short term although the monthly bands protect us on monthly volume swings they are not very effective in preventing sudden unplanned short term load swings triggering imbalance penalties here the language currently in contracts that is supposed to protect us against this risk notice of operational changes you agree to promptly advise us of any event reasonably known to you that may impact energy usage at any account eg equipment installations outages shutdowns repairs openings or closings changes in operating hours by an amount without regard to weatherrelated effects greater than either i two five of the actual usage for such account during the same billing cycle in the prior year or ii two mw each an operational change if you fail to notify us of an operational change you will reimburse us for any energy imbalance charges incurred by you or us as a result of such operational change this language has at least three problems no compensation mechanism specified if customer does not deliver on this requirement is two five and or two mw justifiable especially given the differences in imbalance treatment across physical markets no clear process ie minimum time frame for notice contact information specified for customer to deliver this notice i would modify this language to something like notice of operational changes customer agrees to advise eesi at least two days four eight hours in advance to the contacts listed in schedule ____ by fax or email of any event that may impact energy demand at any of its accounts eg equipment installations outages shutdowns repairs openings or closings changes in operating hours by an amount greater than either i ___ of the hourly load for such account during the same hour in the prior year or ii zero five mw of demand each an operational change if such customer fails to notify eesi of an operational change customer will reimburse eesi for any energy imbalance charges incurred by the customer or eesi as a result of such operational change the mechanism for penalty calculation is specified in schedule ____ hope this helps mallik forwarded by

last update three zero three pm et aug two three two zero zero zero newswatch latest headlines san diego cbsmw the federal government will provide grants and loans to help local residents and businesses pay for soaring electricity bills president clinton said wednesday clinton said two six million will be earmarked to help lowincome families and seniors pay for electricity bills that have more than doubled he urged the small business administration to provide loans to companies that are struggling to pay power bills he also called for expediting the investigation of wholesale power markets by the federal energy regulatory commission well do what we can to help you the president said during a televised news conference at the white house in washington test case yields public outcry the san diego area is a test case for the rest of the country over the feasibility of electric industry deregulation the region which also encompasses south orange county north of san diego is the first in the nation to have its power market completely deregulated new york new england and midatlantic states are following suit and theyre watching california carefully thus far the san diego test has turned out to be a shambles electricity supply that hasnt increased in one zero years failed this summer to meet strong demand resulting from a growing state with market forces in play for the first time strong demand led to much higher wholesale rates that was passed along to residents after a public outcry the california public utilities commission on monday approved a plan that would cap customers electric bills for normal use but theyll pay market rates for anything extra utility companies also can collect on any shortfalls later today on cbs marketwatch nasdaq inches higher dow lags oil inventories at two four year low commentary garzarelli sees stock rally in fourth quarter amazoncom enters car market california is electric industry test case more top stories cbs marketwatch columns updated eight two three two zero zero zero three zero two zero eight pmet in other words if the electric company cant pass along the entire cost of buying the energy for now theyll be able to pass it along months later therefore people who are used to seeing lower electricity bills for the cooler months in fall and winter wont see much of a dropoff its a shameful paynoworpaylater plan said bob finkelstein staff attorney for the utility reform network a consumer advocacy group california jumped off the deregulation cliff state legislators which have the power to expand on the commissions ruling shelved a plan to roll back rates to midone nine nine nine levels and cap them for customers of san diego gas electric a sempra energy sre news msgs subsidiary they faced opposition from gov gray davis a democrat and from republican lawmakers davis prefers a plan that would cut rates by six zero percent immediately but that would stipulate customers pay the full amount of what they owe later republican lawmakers want the state to use taxpayers money to help pay electric bills for consumers while businesses get tax credits san diego fiasco the southern california fiasco came about as a result of a deregulated electricity market that began two years ago the effects of deregulation are being felt first in the san diego area because it was the first to end its rate freeze last summer the rest of california should follow region after region by two zero zero two the idea sounded good deregulate the electric industry and let the market set the prices with competition rates should come down and service should improve when the longdistance phone market was deregulated it did bring about low prices and greater competition but things got messed up along the way for one the hope that consumers and businesses could one day shop for electricity as they shop for better deals among longdistance carriers was dashed at least for now initially hundreds of companies had signed up to offer power but most have gone out of business or left the market of the remaining companies most serve the more lucrative corporate market said linda sherry a spokeswoman at consumer action also the strategy of letting housing developments form power cooperatives and negotiate better rates didnt pan out sherry said demand far outstrips supply demand for power in california surged as businesses and the population grew but supply didnt grow with it because no new electric generation plants have been built in the state for one zero years last year the state approved five applications to build new plants but theyre years away from becoming operational under the deregulated market electric utility companies were mandated to sell their power generation plants by separating the provider of electricity and the generator of electricity the idea is to usher in a more competitive market today san diego gas electric buys from electric generators through an auction market but the auction market rules as set up actually make the situation in san diego worse according to the federal energy regulatory commission when electric utilities accept bids from generators at various prices they are required to pay to everyone the rate of the highest bid but in a situation where the electric company needs all the power available it has to accept all the bids and apply the highest price to every deal inflating the cost electric generators were taking advantage of the situation by charging more sherry said ferc is investigating and plans to issue a report later this year but for now price caps have been set utility company buffeted ed van herik a sempra spokesman said the auction rules are putting the squeeze on utility companies already buffeted from all sides by public outcry and political pressure but utility reform networks finkelstein said san diego gas electric isnt totally blameless because it could have done a better job of hedging high costs they could have entered into futures contracts to hedge these risks which would have allowed the utility to buy electricity at prices under normal conditions the attorney

four or five slides by friday detailing the structure we are proposing remember that the counterparty is not very finance savvy so we need to make this one simple call me tomorrow morning on my cell phone to discuss brian initial background stuff the network mci built the system the iso currently shares its private dedicated network five zero five zero with the california power exchange though the iso would like to take control of one zero zero of the asset network currently operating at about one two capacity the current network consists of four ocone two s as part of the contract the iso has a call to upgrade to four ocfour eight s this scalability was built in to accommodate what california believed would be a very large and rapidly growing number of users mostly scheduling coordinators but california greatly overestimated the number so the iso is left with a lot of excess capacity about one two the capacity is currently used by the px but the iso would like to terminate that relationship as quickly as possible if possible its an atm switched network with one one apops and four bpops and it runs from folsom sacramento to alhambra around pasadena the bpop locations are hayward sacramento long beach and claremont the contract the iso pays about three zero three five millionyr under the contractsignificantly out of the money the contract ends at the end of two zero zero three the contract apparently includes a costless or very low cost option to upgrade from ocone two to ocfour eight the contract also permits interconnection to the network by mci for four eight five irrespective of distance for customers interconnecting in order to play in the iso i assume access to the network is defined as dsone the goals of the isos evpcio desperate to reduce costs immediately needs to take a plan designed to mitigate the costs to his board by the end of june wants to maintain some flexibility in the event usage grows would like to do a short term deal for nonfirm service and get a high price but would do a longterm firm deal if it reduced his costs significantly next steps get info we need from the iso to put together a couple of possible solutions meet with evpcio by end of next week to present the options proposed questions for the iso how much money do they want to save in our meeting the cio said he wanted to unwind the deal that the px has for half of the network capacity that happened yet going to happen soon how much would it cost to have mci upgrade the system to ocfour eight how long would it take do they have a detailed map of the network they could provide us further details the woman who manages the mci contract michelle windmillercalled me yesterday and told me the following the option in the contract is for additional ocone two circuits the cost per circuit is one one four zero zero circuitdan does this price make sense to you they have no idea if that price is in the money takes two two days to install incremental circuit wo mci router takes three zero days wmci router the contract does not limit the number of incremental circuits that the iso can demand from mci the evpcios target for savings is five mmyear recall that they are currently paying three zero three five mmyear the are open to us financing a buyout but prefer to outsource the entire network to us and share in the savings michelle wants us to help them understand exactly what the nature of the product is that theyre sitting on and if theres a market for it mcis telling them that there aint no market for what theyve got they want our view michelle thinks that folks at the iso are still under the illusion that theyre sitting on a superhighway when they really have a country road she wants us to help reorient their thinking they need to meet pronto because the evpcio has to give the iso board a progress report next thursday on the basis of the meeting that dan and i had with them some time back the evp apparently went to the last board meeting and told the board that he was actively working on a potential solution and would report back at the upcoming meeting michelle wants to meet on monday but we have conflicts so i have left her a message saying that it needs to be on tuesday morning,15:56:00,"Yes

significantly increased as a result of a combination of factors including higher natural gas prices reduction in available hydroelectric generation resources increased demand overreliance on the spot market for electricity and limitations on supply californias regulatory regime instituted in one nine nine six permitted wholesale price increases but froze retail prices below market levels the resulting disparity between costs of supply and customer revenues caused two of californias public utilities pacific gas electric company pge and southern california edison company sce to accrue substantial unrecovered wholesale power costs and certain obligations related to the difference between third party power purchase costs and frozen rates charged to retail customers pge and sce have defaulted on or are challenging payments owed for certain outstanding obligations including wholesale power purchased through the california power exchange the power exchange from the california independent system operator the independent system operator and from qualifying facilities in addition pge and the power exchange each have filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy various legislative regulatory and legal remedies to the energy situation in california have been implemented or are being pursued and may result in restructuring of markets in california and elsewhere additional initiatives are likely at the federal state and local level but it is not possible to predict their outcome at this time enron has entered into a variety of transactions with california utilities the power exchange the independent system operator end users of energy in california and other third parties and is owed amounts by certain of these entities enron has established reserves related to such activities and believes that the combination of such reserves in accounts receivables and price risk management assets and other credit offsets with such parties are adequate to cover its exposure to developments in the california power market due to the uncertainties involved the ultimate outcome of the california power situation cannot be predicted but enron believes these matters will not have a material adverse impact on enrons financial condition or results of operations india enron indirectly owns five zero of the net voting interest in dabhol power company dabhol

dabhol and the government of maharashtra gom and the federal government of india goi the guarantors of payments by the mseb pursuant to the terms and conditions of the power purchase agreements ppa and the other project documents the contract disputes relate principally to the failure by the mseb to pay certain capacity and energy payments under the ppa and the failure of the gom and goi to satisfy certain guarantee obligations under the project documents there is no assurance that dabhol will be able to resolve such disputes to its favor and to successfully collect on and to enforce any

date tue two nine jan two zero zero two one one two five three two zero eight zero zero i do hope you can come with us how fun that you have been down in utah sounds great of course you could stay with me on the friday night that would be perfect must tell you though that there is a bit of change in plans sam and ali in order to make the trip somewhat cheaper have also invited a couple of guys that they know to stay with us as well im fine with it because i say the more the merrier but it could be kind of crowded of course the guys will be on the floor with their sleeping bags and the girls will have the beds but still i guess this would have to be something you are comfortable with i really dont think wed have to even hang out with the guys much we could and i plan on totally doing my own thing ali and sam are both really cool they are partiers and very fun but also sweet and very smart ali graduated from washington state with a degree in art studies i think and studied abroad in denmark for a year sam is a school teacher english junior high aged kids and went to college somewhere in california where they are both from they are cool and i think you would get along great with them and they with you of course it would be great if you could coincide your trip with another one to have a few interviews up here hope you can find a cheap flight and let me know how the job search is going take care bonnie ps i did hear about the suicide of one of the top execs so incredibly sad what a messy business i saw ken lays wife interviewed she maintains her husband is entirely innocent and had nothing to do with the fall etc what do you make of that it was very interesting oh my date with the memphis guy was good very interesting he was really cute and we kissed at the end of the night it was fun he was funny would definitely go out with him again if he asked but we are also pretty different people for instance he never drinks original message from susan scott

you and seattle and how i need to get myself up there im using this email bc im actually in utah right now visiting my friend monique and for some reason this computer wont let me send things from my other address anyway i flew in today and will be here through tuesday at least its absolutely beautiful right now im hanging at the internet cafe until monique gets off work and then were going to grab some food and maybe go out for a bitsupposedly its australia day here i think its an informal holiday so you know tonight will be fun w all the aussies around here painting the town red the whistler trip sounds awesome i will definitely do some research and see what kind of fares i can find to get myself up there a huge part of me is still feeling this intense draw to move to the emerald city hopefully something will pan out that allows that to happen we shall see this last week at work was so tryingjust making the decisions i had to etc but everyone there has been really cool about it and has offered to help in any way they can most of the older married people are encouraging me to just enjoy myself and have an adventure im not sure if you heard the latest news from enron but one of our former execs he resignedretired in may committed suicide its very sad and just reconfirms to me that this chapter of my life needs to be closed and that i need to head on to bigger and better things its been entirely too taxing to deal w all the emotions than accompany this type of thingand somehow still being a part of the reformed trading organization would only seem to keep those wounds open for me ok enough morbid stuff hope all is well with you if i remember correctly you are supposed to be on your date tonight with the west point guy cant wait to here how that went i will get back to you asap about whistleras soon as ive had a chance to look at airfares and my options do you think itd be possible to stay with you friday night if i did end up coming that way we could head out bright and early saturday morning fortunately im going to get some skiing in up here or down here in relation to youits been about three yrs since the last time i skied should prove
