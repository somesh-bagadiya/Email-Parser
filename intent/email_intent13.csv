zero one los angeles times home edition athree copyright two zero zero one the times mirror company sacramento nudging government toward an expanded role in the energy business a senate committee tuesday approved two farreaching bills paving the way for the state to buy californias sprawling electrical transmission grid and build and operate its own power plants the legislation aims to protect california from the crisis it faces today a nightmare of supply shortages and skyhigh power prices said the bills author senate leader john l burton dsan francisco what were trying to do here is give the state some influence and control over its own destiny burton said the idea is to provide affordable reliable energy at times we need it most one of the bills authorizes gov gray davis to negotiate with californias beleaguered utilities about a state takeover of the transmission system a transaction that could help them avoid bankruptcy by paying anywhere from three billion to nine billion for the three two zero zero zero miles of electric wires the state would provide the utilities with cash to help relieve their mushrooming debt some would call it a bailout burton said i would prefer to call it an infusion of capital davis prefers the term buyout and said any state takeover of the grid should be a moneymaker talking with reporters after a speech in los angeles davis said he hopes to announce a proposal friday under which the state would receive the transmission system a financial stake in the utility companies and some other assetpossibly some of the utilities hydroelectric facilitiesin exchange for billions of dollars in state cash we will insist upon receiving commensurate equivalent value for any value we confer on the utilities davis said the governor added that the utilities parent companieswhich have received among other assets billions of dollars in tax overpayments from southern california edison and pacific gas electricshould help bring the utilities back to fiscal health tuesday marked the two nine th straight day in which california endured a stage three power alert with energy reserves critically low on the grid serving most of of the state grid operators came closer than usual to triggering rotating blackouts but by the evening hours of peak demand officials at the california independent system operator were optimistic that conservation and power purchases would help them dodge outages caliso spokesman patrick dorinson blamed the power shortfall on a cold snap that boosted electricity consumption and on the shutdown of power plants capable of generating onethird of the states winter peak demand four years after electric utilities were partially deregulated in california the state is caught in a tangle of skyrocketing energy prices booming demand and short supplies battered by debt the states largest investorowned utilities lack the cash and credit to buy power themselves forcing the state to step into the electricity market for more than three weeks the state department of water resources has spent an average of four five million a day purchasing power as negotiators work to nail down longterm power contracts under a one zero billion program authorized by the legislature davis maintains that in recent weeks the state has made major progress toward solving the electricity crisis officials have signed four very good contracts with electricity providers begun an eight zero zero million conservation program and embarked upon an aggressive drive to get power plants built he said in other developments tuesday the precarious financial condition of edison and pge remained a top concern of utilitywatchers as a grace period granted by banks that are owed money by edison expired we are now on a daily involuntarybankruptcy filing watch said steven fleishman a utility analyst with merrill lynch co we believe that creditors will wait to see what plan the governor proposes but time is short edison formally asked a group of two three banks for an extension of a three zero day period of forbearance on a two three zero million default ted craver edison internationals chief financial officer said in a conference call with debt holders the banks had not yet responded he said several electricity generators have said they are willing to wait for the utility debtrelief plan that davis and legislators have promised in the coming days the governors spokesman steve maviglio said tuesday they have signaled to us that they have patience he said most of the action in the capitol on tuesday centered on burtons two bills both of which cleared the senate energy committee and will go next to the appropriations committee a third measure sb five x by sen byron sher dstanford which would provide one two billion in taxpayer subsidies to consumers government entities and businesses to help pay for conservation measures also passed burton said his bill paving the way for the purchase of the transmission grid sb three three x is based on the concept of willing buyer willing seller and would not lead to any unilateral seizure of utility assets although it attracted support from consumer groups skeptics say that the system is overburdened and needs an estimated one billion in repairs and expansionand that it costs several million dollars annually to maintain as lawmakers debated the bill a private company quietly pressed its own bid to buy the system transelect inc has offered to pay five two five billion for the grid company vice president bob mitchell was in the capitol to pitch the idea to lawmakers most of whom are indifferent to the notion were not convinced that a single forprofit monopoly owner of the grid gains the people a lot said assemblyman bill leonard rsan bernardino but others said they were open to proposal we certainly prefer to keep the transmission grid in the private sector where it belongs said jamie fisfis spokesman for republican assembly leader bill campbell rvilla park the other burton bill approved tuesday sb six x seeks to create a california consumer power and conservation financing authority that would build finance and run power plants alone or in partnership with private generators the new agency would be financed by the sale of up to five billion in bonds which would be repaid by revenues from power sales the bill also would empower the state to take over private plants by condemnation several other states including new york operate public generation and transmission facilities burton said adding that they provide electricity at favorable rates burton insisted that the agency would supplement but not take over the electricity business that traditionally has been a privatesector enterprise in california he predicted that the state would involve itself mostly in peaking generatorsportable generators about the size of bigrig truckswhose energy would be tapped during periods of short supply but high demand such as hot summers and cold winters but gop sens charles poochigian of fresno and william morrow of oceanside voiced fears that the public energy agency would be too dominant and could disadvantage private generators with its power of condemnation this bill is pretty much sending a large bright red flag morrow told burton lobbyists for the power generators testifying before the committee agreed that a public power authority could scare off private investors reluctant to compete with the state that type of uncertainty about the states role in this system can have the role of discouraging private capital said mike day a lobbyist for enron corp in another development tuesday state officials working to fire up new power plants to add five zero zero zero megawatts of electricity by this summer raised the possibility that the new generators might not be adequate to meet demand winston hicox director of the california environmental protection agency said the gap between supply and demand could be greater than five zero zero zero megawatts this summer given that other western states probably wont be sending as much electricity to california and that the states own production of hydroelectric power might be low calling conservation steps incredibly important hicox said the state needs to cut use by at least seven to avoid blackouts meanwhile the california republican party said it will begin airing a second radio ad today blasting davis a democrat for his handling of the energy crisis unlike the first ad which ran in smaller markets on conservative radio stations the new ad will run in los angeles and san francisco on mainstream stations said a party spokesman on the federal level president bush said tuesday that he intends to discuss californias power needs and other energy policy issues in his talks friday with president vicente fox of mexico they will talk about improving the power plants to be able to help additional power get into the western grid bush told reporters aboard air force one on a flight back to washington after visiting the norfolk va naval base bush said he also intends to discuss the flow of natural gas between the two countries specifically the issue of california natural gas flowing to mexican power plants its conceivable that that gas will be interrupted and it will create obviously a problem for

california copyright c two zero zero one krtbn knight ridder tribune business news source world reporter tm gov gray davis and top lawmakers have enlisted a small circle of energy insiders to help craft electricity bills and policies that could indirectly affect their financial interests key parts of the one zero billion financial plan that launched the state into the power buying business were written by investment bankers for credit suisse first boston which also works for a texas power generator other advisers include a former southern california edison executive who owned stock in three independent power companies while advising the governor a third is a new york banker whose company prepared the sale of one four billion in securities last week for two power generators who sell electricity in california these power companies earned record profits last year selling electricity into californias troubled market state utilities were pushed to the brink of insolvency by power prices because their billing rates were still frozen by one nine nine six rules that deregulated the market now some lawmakers consumer advocates and legal scholars worry that the businessmen who have come to sacramento to help sort out the mess are too closely tied to these same power companies and wont be able to place the interests of the state and its small electricity users first theyve let the fox into the hen house said peter navarro a university of california irvine business professor and author of the dimming of america which predicted a national deregulation fallout the deregulation bill was drafted in large part by utility lobbyists if weve learned anything from this it should be that people with a vested interest shouldnt draft legislation no one denies that industry insiders are playing a critical role inside the statehouse but davis administration officials and assembly speaker robert hertzberg say they needed industry experts to help solve the states energy crisis i said give me the best possible experts in the investment banking world hertzberg said everyone who is an expert has conflicts all over the place the outcome of these energy initiatives could prove beneficial to some of the states advisers or their companies southern california edison vice president larry hamlin joined the davis team last thursday as the project manager for the governors new plan to speed construction of power plants statewide hamlin has taken a twomonth leave from edison where he was vice president of power production and operations a faster construction cycle could directly benefit the utilitys operations and generating divisions former treasury secretary robert e rubin chairman of the executive committee at citigroup inc was appointed in january to advise davis on bond financing longterm power contracts and ownership of power plants sec filings show that citigroups salomon smith barney subsidiary works as an investment banker for several private power companies that sell electricity in california salomon prepared for sale last week one one five billion in securities offered by calpine corp and three zero zero million in securities by aes corp in addition citigroup owned or managed two five billion in independent power company stocks as of september two zero zero zero a citigroup spokeswoman said neither rubin nor the company would have any comment on his role michael r peevey a former president of southern california edison co began advising the governor last june peevey left edison in one nine nine three and formed new energy ventures inc a nonutility energy service provider which he sold to aes corp in one nine nine nine for one zero zero million he now sits on the board of excelergy a lexington mass provider of technology to energy companies a sworn disclosure signed by his wife assemblywoman carol liu dla canada flintridge shows that the couple owned between two zero zero zero zero and two one zero zero zero zero of stock in aes enron and unisource all independent power companies last year the unisource stock was purchased one month after peevey began his advisory role liu said in an interview that peevey has sold all his energy stocks since she made that disclosure dec one five davis spokesman steve maviglio said he was unaware that peevey had continued to hold power company stocks after the appointment neither peevey hamlin nor rubin responded to requests for an interview but maviglio said the governor has chosen the best people and is reviewing suggestions to make sure the best interests of californians are being protected it seems natural to tap people who are the best at this and can get the job done for california said maviglio they know that they need to separate their past and their future when it comes to helping the state many experts applaud these choices if youre in a bind and california clearly is who better to enlist than the insiders is it a potential conflict yes is it a big one not likely said ucla finance professor william m cockrum a specialist in business ethics and a former investment banker himself cockrum said such relationships are routine on wall street and investment bankers are trained to handle them what you want is a bunch of smart people who are used to dealing with economic realities cockrum said not everyone agrees it is a different matter when public dollars are at stake and matters of public policy of this order of magnitude are being decided said harvard law professor elizabeth warren the legislature needs to be clear when they are getting independent advice and when they are getting lobbied just because this is how business is always done doesnt mean its right lawmakers have raised similar concerns saying there hasnt been enough disclosure of potential conflicts im uncomfortable with someone who represents a stakeholder like power generators providing independent advice on which direction we should go said sen joe dunn dsanta ana these are folks out of the financial markets whose businesses may very well have a lot at stake in terms of the outcome of this crisis i dont think we can consider that to be independent advice dunn was talking specifically about the role of credit suisse first boston which worked to restructure el paso electric co which went bankrupt in one nine nine two today the investment firm is preparing a public stock offering for a new subsidiary of reliant energy of houston called reliant energy resources securities and exchange commission documents show as of september one nine nine nine the company also held or managed three five million worth of stock in aes corp which owns power plants in orange county investment bankers usually earn between one percent and two five percent of the amount underwritten the exact amount is not disclosed credit suisse first boston declined comment other than to say hertzberg asked its investment bankers to help and they are working for free some of davis appointments have been applauded for instance he tapped los angeles department of water and power head david freeman to lead the states negotiations for longterm contracts with power suppliers freeman has been praised for his role at the dwp because he fought against those who wanted to sell the public utilitys own generators there is no one i would rather have negotiating for the state of california said assemblywoman jackie goldberg dlos angeles he has never worked for anything other than the public this man lives and breaths and thinks about what is in the best interest of ratepayers others sought by the governor decided on their own they had too many conflicts in january consultants from investment banker goldman sachs met with davis finance director tim gage to discuss advising the governor goldman sachs owns j aron a singaporebased energy trader that supplies one zero percent of pacific gas and electrics natural gas needs according to sec records goldman also held or managed more than one five billion in power company stocks as of september of one nine nine nine and is listed as another lead underwriter with credit suisse on the reliant public offering consumer advocates immediately began criticizing goldman for its conflicts goldman decided shortly thereafter that its competing business interests posed a conflict critics worried about the role of the investment bankers said their concerns mounted when they learned that credit suisse was doing more than offering advice hertzberg asked the company to craft a financing plan for the states power purchases abone x the landmark bill which put california into the longterm energy buying business included a revenue bond financing plan written by credit suisse another part of credit suisse plan which would use the bonds to pay off utilities past debts has stalled in committee and may die there some lawmakers say the experts have helped protect californians for example abone x has a provision that came from a panel of bankruptcy attorneys who are advising the governor and the legislature the state was going to buy energy and then sell it to the utilities but this would have made the state an automatic party in any bankruptcy lawsuit as a result of advice from experts the state is making sure the energy gets delivered to customers but the ownership of the electricity never shifts to the utilities we learned that if we are going to go out and buy power there are very specific things we must do to protect ourselves hertzberg said for example that if there was a bankruptcy we would have been is an unsecured creditor their advice has been very valuable and hertzberg said when it comes to advisors with serious conflicts the legislature is smart enough to take the advice of experts and recognize any bias but dunn the santa ana senator thinks the issue is too complex with all due respect thats nonsense dunn said no one in this building can rise to the sophistication of the players in this market their entire professional life is dedicated to make sure they understand how this works in all its subtletiesin fact the advisers may believe they can step aside and provide independent unbiased advise but i dont think they can if you have lived your life in this arena you have a certain point of view by chris knap kimberly kindy and mark katches register staff writer kate berry

the market that these sorts of games have to stop and of course theres increasing pressure coming out of the ministry he told reuters during the eworld of energy conference and exhibition edis a subsidiary of major utility eon has until march eight to respond to charges its fees are more than five zero percent above the national market average hennemeyer said the cartel office was doing a good job given it was badly resourced and with its role reduced to rule whether certain tariffs were anticompetitive on a case by case basis the office cannot actually set tariff levels hennemeyer said a state regulator would be better placed to ensure competition but the preferred reliance on voluntary agreements had created reasonable conditions for wholesale power markets since their

pipeline values spicker who attended closeddoor meetings last week through aquilas membership of the european federation of energy traders efet said it was highly doubtful that a solution could be found on february two one that would pass governmental and eu scrutiny one of the most controversial points was that pipeline operators wanted to base charges on renewal costs of their facilities when many installations had long been written off spicker said we refuse to help pay for pipelines that have already enabled the incumbents to reap profits for many decades he said the economics ministry

international repute one to be decided by it one by suzuki and the third by mutual consent the entire basis for valuation indeed the entire process at each stage will be made completely transparent shourie said this decision was one of the five options before the ccd the outcome of a series of discussions between a panel of union government secretaries and suzuki in addition on monday the secretaries had another detailed discussion with financial institutions on what would be needed if the rights issue was cleared suzukis main concern in the talks already held was to ensure we dont disinvest our share in favour of one of their competitors shourie said adding it was a legitimate wish the ccd he said had decided on doing it this way to ensure two things one to ensure maruti retains its competitive strength two to ensure maximum valuation of the governments present equity in it the ccd decision aims at ensuring both he said in another development the union cabinet discussed the power situation in the country and the reforms in the sector the discussion took place after power minister suresh prabhu gave a presentation on the power sector reforms the slide presentation and the paper on the power scenario in the country provide an insight into the various mechanisms being put in place for augmenting power supply while refusing to divulge any details of the presentation parliamentary affairs minister pramod mahajan said it focussed on the power situation to a query whether the enron issue also came up for discussion the minister said it was only a small part of the overall discussions power reforms and regulations kirit parikh zero two one four two zero zero one business standard one one copyright c business standard power shortages scheduled power cuts and unscheduled brownouts have plagued the country for many years the process of privatisation and reforms was begun in one nine nine two to solve these problems yet eight years later the situation is if anything worse than before why is it what have we done why has not it worked what should we do it is obvious that power shortages imply lack of capacity to generate power in turn this reflects inadequate investment in building power plants transmission and distribution network or fuel production and transport capacity it could also reflect poor operation of existing capacities in mideighties when rajiv gandhi became the prime minister he concentrated on the latter and emphasised improving load factor of thermal plants this worked for some time but the slack was more or less exhausted by early nineties today the average load factor on thermal plants has reached six eight per cent which is very good since then despite some progress in further raising load factor lack of adequate investment has been the main reason for power shortages over the last decade installed generating capacity has grown by five zero per cent whereas power generation has grown by one three zero per cent inadequate investment was mainly the result of the inability of state electricity boards sebs to generate financial surpluses the main reasons for the financial sickness of sebs are poor pricing of electricity and pilferage most sebs subsidise highly agricultural consumers and some also domestic consumers all have high losses due to pilferage of power disguised as transmission and distributions td losses and also as agricultural consumption this is the fundamental reason for power shortages unfortunately instead of tackling this main problem successive governments have tried to skirt around it their efforts at reforms have more or less failed what have they done and why have they failed the first attempt was to attract private investors to set up generating plants the power sector was opened up for private both domestic and foreign power generators in one nine nine two despite massive interest of private investors the progress has been miniscule the private generators were required to sell only to the sebs when ones only customer is financially sick one would think twice before getting into the business the difficulties maharashtra seb is facing in meeting enrons bills would make private producers think even more before they invest in fact unless the financial sickness of the sebs is taken care of private power generators are even less likely to come now once the reluctance of private generators was perceived the government thought of megaprojects there were and are to be large projects which would supply power relatively cheaply to reduce the price of power the government offered concessions such as no customs duty and longer tax holiday thus the government provides the subsidy up front but here also the unreliability of sebs as customers which may not honour bills is a problem to get around this a new public corporation called power trading corporation ptc is envisaged this will buy all the power from a megaproject pay the bill how and in turn sell the power to different sebs how would the ptc collect its dues from sebs if it cannot presumably the central government will foot the bill the sick sebs would have an even greater incentive to default on payment to a public corporation than to a private generator this is obvious as today the various sebs together owe public sector corporations such as ntpc coal india nhpc etc rs two seven zero zero zero crore pricing and pilferage reforms are inescapable if we delay these reforms even good firms like ntpc would be dragged down by the sick sebs the chief ministers agree in new delhi to raise tariff for agricultural consumers but as soon as they return to state capitals they develop cold feet only a handful of chief ministers have made some progress here to force state governments to raise the price of power the idea of state electricity regulatory commission serc was thought of sercs are to be independent statutory bodies and are to prescribe power tariffs if a state government wants so subsidise any particular set of consumers it has to give direct budgetary support to the seb this roundabout way has not yet produced substantial result and progress is understandably slow as the sercs are appointed by state governments only three state sercs had issued tariff orders by the end of june two zero zero zero to deal with pilferage ie theft of power should be easy unfortunately it is not as some of the large staff of sebs collude in this theft thus it was felt that if distribution is privatised the problem of pilferage can be solved naturally the seb unions oppose such moves the progress has been miniscule only orissa has fully privatised distribution some states have privatised small parts of their system the few cases where distribution is privatised customers have not been happy as they are asked to pay higher price they pay it but do not see any improvement in the reliability of quality of supply if reforms are done properly consumers who are not subsidised at present should benefit from them reforms should improve the efficiency of the system reduce costs and hence price for such consumers how should we carry out reforms which have such effects privatisation of distribution is the necessary first step however it should be done in a way that does not turn the consumers away from reforms for this we should set up a process which ensures that consumers are not required to pay any more for the inefficiency of the system this requires the following first of all we should work out the minimum cost at which an efficiently working power system without pilferage would supply power to different consumers consumers should be informed about it and made to accept that they have to pay such a price next sercs should not permit anyone to charge a price higher than the optimal price or the present price whichever is higher if the present price is higher it should be brought down to optimal level in a time bound schedule over two or three years the private distribution company should be given a plan of eliminating pilferage over a period of two years as per an agreed schedule the state should compensate the private distributor for pilfered power only as per the agreed schedule if the private firm eliminates pilferage at a faster pace it would make extra profit if it delays it loses money that is its incentive such a scheme makes privatisation of distribution acceptable to consumers who should see better cheaper power with higher efficiency so deal with the main problem first dpc not to invoke central guarantee our corporate bureau mumbai zero two one four two zero zero one business standard one copyright c business standard the enron promoted dabhol power company dpc has decided not to invoke the central government counterguarantee for now although the maharashtra government failed to pay the rs one five two crore bill for december two zero zero zero on tuesday dpc had invoked the state government guarantee last week when the maharashtra state electricity board failed to pay the bill the last date for paying the bill as per the terms of the state government guarantee was tuesday this is not a double default situation they have already paid the november bill and only the december bill is pending consequently we have decided not to invoke the counterguarantee for the moment said neil mcgregor ceo and president of dpc when queried further he clarified that this did not mean that the counterguarantee would not be invoked at all the next key date is february two five when the january two zero zero one bill becomes due he added it is also learnt that dpc does not want to embarrass the state government at a time when negotiations are due to be held with the godbole panel the maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel under former union home secretary madhav godbole to review the controversial power project meanwhile dpc has said in a press statement that it has received the outstanding amount of rs seven four crore towards the november bill the receipt of this payment as well as the formation of the review committee are very positive signals enron saga powered by govt generosity rajesh ramachandran zero two one four two zero zero one the times of india copyright c two zero zero one the times of india source world reporter tm new delhi the tariff structure of enrons dabhol power project was conceived in such a manner that it was inevitable that the company would invoke its counterguarantee against the maharashtra and union governments the shiv senabjp combine came to power in maharashtra in one nine nine five on the slogan of throwing enron into the arabian sea soon after it cancelled the project later it renegotiated the deal with enron and even gave an assurance for the second phase meanwhile the one three day vajpayee government approved the extension of the government of indias counterguarantee on may two seven one nine nine six the first counterguarantee given on september one five one nine nine four was for phasei of the dabhol project with a capacity of six nine five mw after the ssbjp government cancelled the project the then finance secretary montek singh ahluwalia told the parliamentary subcommittee on fasttrack projects that as of today if the power purchase agreement ppa is being revised that means the counterguarantee is not effective when ahluwalia said this in one nine nine five the project was being cancelled only to be renegotiated again after enrons rebecca mark visited bal thackeray but ahluwalia had held that if the ppa is revised the earlier counterguarantee would not hold good yet the union power minister told parliament in may one nine nine six that the counter guarantee held good thus a member of the standing committee gave a breach of privilege notice against ahluwalia for misleading the house the finance ministry on behalf of ahluwalia replied to parliament thus while the government of maharashtra had announced its decision for cancellation of the dabhol power project the ppa between mseb and the company was not terminated that is despite the project being cancelled the agreement to purchase power from the cancelled project is valid and hence the counterguarantee stands it was then pointed out by the member who had moved the breach of privilege notice that the contract was repudiated by the maharashtra government after renegotiation the project itself was revised there was a change in the capacity of the project the fuel to be used the capital cost tariff and change in scope after inclusion of phase ii of the project which was not included earlier in reply ahluwalia submitted that the counterguarantee had provided for amendments to be made to the ppa subject to prior written approval by the central government thus if jaswant singh as finance minister had not approved the extension of the earlier counterguarantee it would not have been valid insofar as the amendments to the ppa were concerned so the onus of the counterguarantee rests with the one three day bjp government which did not wait for a review before it approved the extension of the earlier counterguarantee all this was done within one three days when the government had not even won a vote of confidence in parliament again it was not a fresh counterguarantee but the extension of the earlier one despite the maharashtra governments repudiation its renegotiation with enron and the changed physical parameters of the project it is interesting to note what jaswant singh as chairman of the committee had said about the counterguarantee a year before his government gave the approval for extension counterguaranteeing for any project is uncalled for since several independent power producers are ready to implement projects without any counterguarantee also there appears to be no justification for giving counterguarantee only to selective fasttrack projects

outlined his intention to transform enron into an even bigger global marketmaker the new vision is going to be from the worlds leading energy company to the worlds leading company because we believe markets are critical to every commodity skilling told reuters in his first interview since assuming duties as president and chief executive officer skilling four seven and chairman ken lay over the past one one years transformed enron from a gas and power company into a trading powerhouse with interests outside the energy sector on their belief that many products can be sold like commodities that business model skilling said helped enron outgrow its old vision of becoming the worlds leading energy company the application is almost limitless because every single business has at its heart markets he said so if weve got a better market model we can participate in a whole lot of different businesses and so enron has as its forays into the marketing of broadband capacity data storage steel and pulp and paper have shown skilling said enrons success in the gas and power businesses is proof his company has the wherewithal to take on the biggest companies in wellentrenched industries enron is an incumbent players worst nightmare skilling do you think amoco liked that we were out talking to their customers about buying gas from us that we were packaging from other people no he

after lay named his heir apparent ceo and decided to stay on as chairman but steady only means enrons constant flow of innovation will continue skilling said enron has quickly become able to remove the complex and costly infrastructure around many commodities because of enrononline its internet trading site which has logged more than four zero zero million in notional trades since starting one

enrononline and other competing electronic commodity exchanges like smaller rival dynegy incs dynegy direct as challengers to the hegemony of traditional american markets where traders still physically work on the floor in every commodity whether its interest rates equities securities there is a battle between exchanges skilling said the american futures exchanges are battling for market share with these new electronic approaches electronic exchanges have the advantage of lower personnel costs and flexibility and skilling said the succes of allelectronic trading in european markets is a harbinger of the uss trading future i think its really going to be a function of who can create the most liquidity at the lowest price and thats going to be the market system that will win skilling

today that power generators will be patient while they await a debt repayment plan i guess i would have to agree that the generators and creditors have been very patient craver said still everybodys patience gets thinner as we move forward each week no one has petitioned the utility to push it into involuntary bankruptcy craver said and he called for continuing patience while acknowledging the pace is frustrating for everybody affected by the utilitys payment suspension financing unlikely were trying to encourage people to stand still and give us time to work this thing out craver said it is certainly not our hope nor our intent to go into bankruptcy which would only complicate attempts to arrive at solutions he added in response to a question about when the utility might be able to get financing again edison officials on the call said issues surrounding the implementation of legislation still need addressing i dont think financing is likely to be available while there is so much uncertainty craver said uncertainty has arisen for example over whether the state department of water resources will be paying for all the power purchases for the utilities or whether some spot purchases still might be passed along to the utilities in future bills duke energy corp sued over this issue yesterday claiming the california independent system operator which runs about seven five

assumption the states credit was on the hook for those purchases stephen pickett general counsel of southern california edison said during the teleconference edison is seeking clarification on the matter with the california public utilities commission because it also believes the legislative intent was to have the state covering all the purchases investors also asked several questions about a decision by the utility to make recent payments on taxexempt pollution control bonds the payments were relatively small and missing them would have immediately caused a broader default on all the utilitys first mortgage bonds said ken stewart an assistant general counsel for the utility that would raise the risk of having about two billion of first mortgage bonds subject to acceleration

coming across as an increase when in reality it is simply properly book ing currently that which was previously expected said differently without the disposition we would have spread the tax over time and with the dispos ition it became necessary to accelerate it as reflected in the tax reserve as always i have asked that only the absolutely necessary amount be res erved please call me at ext three

two pm tozero nine kitchen louise subjectzero nine re tax reserve on allegheny peakers the reserve referred to relates to sales and use tax salesuse tax liab ility related to the purchase and use by the peaker project companies of va rious equipment ie turbines in illinois and transformers in tennessee a nd indiana used to construct the peaker facilities in illinois indiana an d tennessee enron bears this tax obligation under the sales agreement pur suant to which we sold the peakers to allegheny effectively this tax liab ility is a preacquisition date tax liability that we as the seller are responsible for typically the equipment used to construct the peakers would be assessed salesuse tax when purchased by the project company that built the respective peaker and that tax would effectively be passed on to the buyer in a sale such as that to allegheny the ews tax department stru ctured the acquisition of the respective equipment to either avoid the sale suse tax or to spread the cost of such tax over time for example a sales leaseback strategy was employed in illinois to spread the cost of the sale suse tax over many years as lease payments are made rather than pay it up front ultimately we benefitted from this since we did not use as much c ash in constructing the peakers and earned more from the disposition of the peakers than we otherwise would have since the counterparty would have an d we believe did in the specific case of allegheny modelled the cost of th e peakers as including the full current payment of such salesuse tax tha t said we have requested that a portion of the disposition proceeds from t he sale of the peakers be reserved until the applicable statute of limitati ons related to the types of strategies that were employed to achieve the ab ove described results expires since there is risk that our position could b e challenged and if challenged there is a risk that we would not prevail matt is out until may eight he is a recent

seven zero zero german was added to the injury report with a strained hamstring and is listed as probable for sundays game he was used as the third receiver earlier this season when tim dwight was sidelined with various injuries but has done little to push for extra playing time german has just one catch all season packers dt gb free agent updated one one one seven zero zero the packers have a tough test ahead of them this week when they face the colts and the trio of peyton manning edgerrin james and marvin harrison their pass defense has been mediocre this season totaling two five sacks and allowing two one six three yards per game they will need to apply a little more pressure on indianapolis to contain manning and harrison look for green bay to come at manning with multiple blitz coverages but that may not be enough for them to have success against the colts and their balanced attack thomas jones rb ari fear updated one one one seven zero zero jones has come down with a case of walking pneumonia and likely wont travel with the team on their trip to philadelphia for this weeks game against the eagles jones has been a real disappointment to fantasy owners thus far accounting for only four one zero yards of total offense and two touchdowns this season david sloan te det the lie downs updated one one one seven zero zero sloan practiced thursday and is expected to play in sundays game he is recovering from a pulled hamstring that kept him out of last weeks game sloan has caught seven passes in his last two games but has failed to score a touchdown this season shawn bryson rb buf meximullets updated one one one seven zero zero with the injury to sammy morris it looks as though bryson will get the start this week against the chiefs if morris has been one of your main tailbacks this season it may be a good idea to pick up bryson if he is still available sammy morris rb buf the fat bastards updated one one one seven zero zero morris remains questionable for sundays game against the chiefs with an ankle injury head coach wade phillips believes that morris will be a gametime decision so keep the bills rookie tailback on the bench this week if at all possible brett favre qb gb mean machine updated one one one seven zero zero favre practiced thursday and is expected to start sundays game at indianapolis the ball came out sharp said offensive coordinator tom rossley he was right on the money i was pleased with what he did today if favre can stay in the game this sunday he could have a big day the colts have one of the weaker pass defenses in the nfl having allowed one five td passes this season frank sanders wr ari mean machine updated one one one six zero zero sanders had his best game in five weeks last sunday catching five passes for eight two yards in arizonas three one one four loss to the vikings he is currently battling a quadricep injury but is listed as probable for this weeks matchup with the eagles it would be a wise move to bench sanders this week especially against an aggressive philadelphia secondary jake plummer qb ari fdic updated one one one six zero zero plummer completed one nine oftwo eight passes for two one nine yards last sunday against the vikings but was held without a touchdown pass in fact the snake has thrown only one touchdown pass in the last four weeks things wont get better for plummer this week against the eagles who will blitz him relentlessly and likely force him to make bad decisions troy brown wr ne fdic updated one one one six zero zero brown caught only two passes for ten yards last sunday against the browns although he has shown flashes of brilliance in the past brown is far too inconsistent to be considered a starter by most fantasy league standards adam vinatieri k ne free agent updated one one one six zero zero vinatieri has connected on eight consecutive field goal attempts dating back to week four against the dolphins with new englands offense sputtering in recent weeks dont expect much from vinatieri this week against the bengals rod rutledge te ne free agent updated one one one six zero zero rutledge caught three passes for two zero yards last sunday against the browns including his first career touchdown with the release of erich bjornson he should become more involved in the patriots offense in the coming weeks if you relied on bjornson as your everday tight end it would be a wise move to pickup rutledge carl pickens wr ten the fat bastards updated one one one six zero zero pickens was held out of practice yesterday because of his injured hamstring he has missed four of his last six games but coach jeff fisher says that he is improving pickens will likely be a gametime decision bashir yamini wr ten free agent updated one one one six zero zero the titans may need to make a roster move with their injuries at wide receiver one possibility is to sign yamini who is on the practice squad and was on the roster earlier in the year to replace chris jackson who will be out for the remainder of the year with a herniated disc in his back jackson had recently been signed off the practice squad eddie george rb ten fear updated one one one six zero zero george was able to participate fully in practice yesterday after receiving a cortisone shot for his injured right big toe earlier in the week he plans on getting more involved in practice this week and hopes to get it strong enough to play sunday against cleveland the only real concern here is whether george may develop turf toe which could require surgery keep a close eye on him and be sure to insure your roster with his backup rodney thomas wade richey k sf free agent updated one one one six zero zero richey has struggled recently missing four of his last six fieldgoal tries last year richey made two one oftwo three attempts he should get a lot of attempts this week against the falcons san francisco should be able to move the chains against atlanta but with terrell owens suffering from turf toe the niners will have problems scoring touchdowns fred beasley rb sf free agent updated one one one six zero zero beasley missed last sundays game because of leftknee and ankle injuries and remains questionable for this week terry jackson will start at fullback if beasley is unable to play in the beginning of the season the niners threw to beasley in goalline situations recently they have chosen to let charlie garner run the ball or to throw to their wideouts beasley scored five touchdowns in the first three games but has none since then jerry rice wr sf thrill kill cult updated one one one six zero zero rice sat out of practice wednesday to rest his sore back he is expected to play this week and is listed as probable on the injury report rice had five catches for five nine yards in the season opener against atlanta at this point in his career rice has very little fantasy value he is being used mainly for routes over the middle and as a decoy

again if mangum is unable to play sunday brad hoover rb car free agent updated one one one six zero zero hoover has been working out with the first team this week in preparation for a possible start against the vikings sunday starter tim biakabutuka is suffering from turf toe and is questionable for the game at minnesota at this point in the season selecting hoover would be a gamble even if he

the rest of the season if he cant play sunday wideout jj stokes would make his second straight start in place of him ryan leaf qb sd free agent updated one one one six zero zero leaf may now get the starting nod for this weeks game against denver head coach mike riley stated earlier in the week that jim harbaugh would be the starter but now says that he will wait a day or two before making a

listed as questionable with a back injury but is unlikely to play rookie tj slaughter erik storz and jason craft would get the starts at their respective positions pittsburgh has a subpar passing game but its running game led by jerome bettis could give the jaguars defense fits come sunday tyrone wheatley rb oak the lie downs updated one one one six zero zero wheatley is listed as questionable for sundays game against the saints he didnt play in monday nights loss to the broncos and will be reevaluated by head coach jon gruden during practice the rest of the week oakland is reportedly talking

might consider a generic reference to the two zero relevant annex that should apply which might let you delete the sentencetwo zero referring to the quality as well does dso need to be defined somewhere the way the different price definitions fit together has also eluded me two zero there is a formula in the long description and a different formula in the two zero gtc unless industry trading convention is to the contrary the site makes two zero more intuitive sense when the volume quoted and the price quoted use the sa metwo zero units if the volume is bandwidth units and the price is a per mile number two zero some counterparties or perhaps more likely their lawyers may be confused two zero the gtc contains the defined term unit price which is in bandwidth unit two zero it seems to me that if we can quote the price as the unit price and thetwo zero volume as bandwidth units we can ignore the number of dsos per bandwidth two zero unit and the number of dso miles for the transaction two zero since they wont change from one product to the next the two sentencestwo zero beginning with any party entering into a transaction could be moved to two zero the gtc the term contractual currency is not used int he gtc can thetwo zero parenthetical reference come out the enrononline people may care about two zero this more than i if the numbers of miles and dsos need to stay in the long descriptions i two zero would suggest that you change the references to make it dsos per bandwidth two zero unit both where the number is introduced and in the price formula and tha ttwo zero the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be per dso mile per two zero month is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number this needs to betwo zero clear from the

gas on sonat this is what we have found out over the last two days ena no longer has the ability to do nominations on sonats scheduling christina sanchez ena scheduler believes that under normal

upstream contract today i spoke with tammi depaolis at sequent she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it i need to know one what volume to sell i assume we are talking about one eight eight nine four nine dth on deal one two two two which means we ignore the loaned volume of nine six zero zero zero dth on deal one four two four two what period do i sell the gas for all out by march three one st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline or base load in april i prefer all out by march three one st but i would like to ask the pipeline if thats ok three how many

zero seven pm subject importance high sensitivity confidential this was just forwarded to me by my mom you definitely only want to read this one during some quiet time one seven yearold brian moore had only a short time to write something for the fellowship of christian athletes meeting it was his turn to lead the discussion so he sat down and wrote he showed the essay titled the room to his mother beth before he headed out the door i wowed em he later told his father bruce its a killer its the bomb its the best thing i ever wrote it also was the last brians parents had forgotten about the essay when a cousin found it while cleaning out the teenagers locker at teary valley high school brian had been dead only hours but his parents desperately wanted every piece of his life near them the crepe paper that had adorned his locker during his senior football season notes from classmates and teachers his homework only two months before he had handwritten the essay about encountering jesus in a file room full of cards detailing every moment of the teens life but it was only after brians death that beth and bruce moore realized that their son had described his view of heaven it makes such an impact that people want to share it you feel like you are there mr moore said brian moore died may two seven one nine nine seven the day after memorial day he was driving home from a friends house when his car went off bulenpierce road in pickaway county and struck a utility pole he emerged from the wreck unharmed but stepped on a downed power line and was electrocuted brian seemed to excel at everything he did he was an honor student he told his parents he loved them a hundred times a day mrs moore said he was a star wide receiver for the tearys valley football team and had earned a fouryear scholarship to capital university in columbus because of his athletic and academic abilities he took it upon himself to learn how to help a fellow student who used a wheelchair at school during one homecoming ceremony brian walked on his tiptoes so that the girl he was escorting wouldnt be embarrassed about being taller than him he adored his kid brother bruce now one four he often escorted his grandmother evelyn moore who lives in columbus to church i always called him the deep thinker evelyn said of her eldest grandson two years after his death his family still struggles to understand why brian was taken from them they find comfort at the cemetery where brian is buried just a few blocks from their home they visit daily a candle and dozens of silk and real flowers keep vigil over the gravesite the moores framed a copy of brians essay and hung it among the family portraits in the living room i think god used him to make a point i think we were meant to find it and make something out of it mrs moore said of the essay she and her husband want to share their sons vision of life after death im happy for brian i know hes in heaven i know ill see him again someday mrs moore said it just hurts so bad now the room in that place between wakefulness and dreams i found myself in the room there were no distinguishing features except for the one wall covered with small index card files they were like the ones in libraries that list titles by author or subject in alphabetical order but these files which stretched from floor to ceiling and seemingly endless in either direction had very different headings as i drew near the wall of files the first to catch my attention was one that read girls i have liked i opened it and began flipping through the cards i quickly shut it shocked to realize that i recognized the names written on each one and then without being told i knew exactly where i was this lifeless room with its small files was a crude catalog system for my life here were written the actions of my every moment big and small in a detail my memory couldnt match a sense of wonder and curiosity coupled with horror stirred within me as i began randomly opening files and exploring their content some brought joy and sweet memories others a sense of shame and regret so intense that i would look over my shoulder to see if anyone was watching a file named friends was next to one marked friends i have betrayed the titles ranged from the mundane to the outright weird books i have read lies i have told comfort i have given jokes i have laughed at some were almost hilarious in their exactness things ive yelled at my brothers others i couldnt laugh at things i have done in my anger things i have muttered under my breath at my parents i never ceased to be surprised by the contents often there were many more cards than i expected sometimes fewer than i hoped i was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the life i had lived could it be possible that i had the time in my years to write each of these thousands or even millions of cards but each card confirmed this truth each was written in my own handwriting each signed with my signature when i pulled out the file marked songs i have listened to i realized the files grew to contain their contents the cards were packed tightly and yet after two or three yards i hadnt found the end of the file i shut it shamed not so much by the quality of music but more by the vast time i knew that file represented when i came to a file marked lustful thoughts i felt a chill run through my body i pulled the file out only an inch not willing to test its size and drew out a card i shuddered at its detailed content i felt sick to think that such a moment had been recorded an almost animal rage broke on me one thought dominated my mind no one must ever see these cards no one must ever see this room i have to destroy them in insane frenzy i yanked the file out its size didnt matter now i had to empty it and burn the cards but as i took it at one end and began pounding it on the floor i could not dislodge a single card i became desperate and pulled out a card only to find it as strong as steel when i tried to tear it defeated and utterly helpless i returned the file to its slot leaning my forehead against the wall i let out a long selfpitying sigh and then i saw it the title bore people i have shared the gospel with the handle was brighter than those around it newer almost unused i pulled on its handle and a small box not more than three inches long fell into my hands i could count the cards it contained on one hand and then the tears came i began to weep sobs so deep that they hurt they started in my stomach and shook through me i fell on my knees and cried i cried out of shame from the overwhelming shame of it all the rows of file shelves swirled in my tearfilled eyes no one must ever ever know of this room i must lock it up and hide the key but then as i pushed away the tears i saw him no please not him not here oh anyone but jesus i watched helplessly as he began to open the files and read the cards i couldnt bear to watch his response and in the moments i could bring myself to look at his face i saw a sorrow deeper than my own he seemed to intuitively go to the worst boxes why did he have to read every one finally he turned and looked at me from across the room he looked at me with pity in his eyes but this was a pity that didnt anger me i dropped my head covered my face with my hands and began to cry again he walked over and put his arm around me he could have said so many things but he didnt say a word he just cried with me then he got up and walked back to the wall of files starting at one end of the room he took out a file and one by one began to sign his name over mine on each card no i shouted rushing to him all i could find to say was no no as i pulled the card from him his name shouldnt be on these cards but there it was written in red so rich so dark so alive the name of jesus covered mine it was written with his blood he gently took the card back he smiled a sad smile and began to sign the cards i dont think ill ever understand how he did it so quickly but the next instant it seemed i heard him close the last file and walk back to my side he placed his hand on my shoulder and said it is finished i stood up and he led me out of the room there was no lock on its door there were still cards to be written i can do all things through christ who strengthens me phil four one three for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life if you feel the same way forward it to as many people as you can so the love of jesus will touch their lives also my people i shared the gospel with file just got bigger how about yours a andrew marwede private client services donaldson lufkin jenrette securities corporation an affiliate of credit

zero is that jim haslett will likely not go outside the team for a back chad two zero morton and jerald moore will likely be the choices with morton getting fir sttwo zero shot mortonzero one s a little undersized at five zero one eight zero one eight and one eight six but so is sa ntwo zero franciscos charlie garner and he manages pretty wellmorton came from a two zero big time program at usc and averaged two zero carries a game last year so itzero one stwo zero not like he isnzero one t used to carrying the load wezero one ll see donzero one t count out brett favre according to espn brett

lets jump right into our upgraded and downgraded players as we head dow ntwo zero the home stretch identifying those players moving up or down can be the two zero difference between making the playoffs or watching from the sidelines a stwo zero we head into our one two th week of listing these players itzero one s inevitable th attwo zero some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list make sure two zero you understand what wezero one re talking about is players that are moving i ntwo zero other words a player like te chad lewis could appear on the downgrade lis ttwo zero and still be good enough to be a starter in your league it just means i zero one mtwo zero concerned about the way he seems to be heading likewise a player like wr two zero laveranues coles may make the upgrade list even though hezero one s still fairl y fartwo zero down the list of wrs itzero one s all about which direction players are movi ng two zero keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the difference joe upgrades and downgrades some of these players are obvious moves up or two zero down and some arent as clear heres my list of guys i see moving this two zero week qbs moving up qb mark brunell jac izero one m one of those guys who quickly points out two zero brunell has never put together fantasy numbers to warrant the hype he two zero receives but you canzero one t deny what brunell has done lately behind a beat uptwo zero line hezero one s standing in there while taking a beating and delivering th etwo zero ball jimmy smith made a roaring comeback and

phi with deuce staley gone mcnabbzero one s had to shoul dertwo zero the offense and this week he came through with flying colors the bad ne wstwo zero is he only completed four seven of his passes sunday the good news is he threw t hetwo zero ball five five times when a qb airs it out five five times in one game it doesnzero one t two zero usually bode well for the teamzero one s chances of winning but itzero one s certain ly atwo zero plus for your ff team to see that many attempts with that many chances two zero itzero one s like allowing yourself to double the stats a jeff blake two

seetwo zero him continue to throw often qb trent dilfer bal remember this list is relative while he may no ttwo zero be a starter dilfer is definitely moving up the charts and thatzero one s what thistwo zero list is all about he actually looked very good at times in the hugetwo zero victory over tennessee sunday he showed nice poise coming back after two zero basically throwing the game away

troy aikman zero one great real nfl qb but not a much f ortwo zero fantasy gms notice a pattern here after being named the starter sunda ytwo zero aikman went out and lit up the bengal defense which was ranked two zero over t hetwo zero last four weeks itzero one s hard to put too much faith in him but if youzero one re two zero desperate for a qb he could be worth a gamble tough matchup this

izero one m one but what zero one s donetwo zero is done all we can do now is look forward and looking forward i seetwo zero blake being forced to carry an increased load qb donovan mcnabb threw t

bthomascolumbiariverbankcom cc subject prescott case this is interesting the other side of the story those beavs arent such bad boys k interesting reading from someone calling himself grackle on the beaver dam at beaver sport central heres what he had to say regarding the prescott trial ive attended much of the trial and here are the pertinent facts one victor becerra the accuservictim a lied about how much he drank that night for example he told the attending doctor at good sam where he had his battered face treated that hed had half a beer that night he also told the grand jury that hed had at most a beer before going over to the party where the fight occurred in fact witnesses testified that hed one beer and consumed at very potent mixed drink a consuelo a consuelo corey here el presidente makes the best consuelos in corvallis consists of six shots of vodka mixed with juice or the like two becerra also lied about not having struck any blows not only did he strike blows he struck first and suffered the consequences first becerra pushed prescott after telling him that he and his boys prescotts friends at the partyjunior addams newsom weathersby weret welcome at the partyprescott then decked him after more less pawing at becerra twice to get him out of his face in between prescotts mild pawing at becerra becerra taunted him by telling prescott he hit like a bitch subsequently things died down for a minute or so and then becerra proceeded to ambush a very drunk addams who at that time was bending down to fix his shoe previously addams had not been involved in any physical confrontation just exactly what did becerra do to adams he grabbed him by the head and kneed him in the faceknocking adams down and splitting his lip then all hell broke loosewith many people fighting each other and with becerra getting the worst of it kicked and punched all of these facts are in the testimony from reliable witnesses and the da doesnt even deny any longer that becerra was the aggressor three my conclusion first becerra only got what he asked for by kneeing adams in the face with no provocation from addams the fact that addams friends beat the heck out of becerra for the cheapshot was the risk becerra took for cheapshotting adams in the first place charges should never have been brought the thing was a brawl started by becerra but since they were why wasnt becerra charged with assault as well four a coach today told me that this case has already hurt recruitingthe words out that corvallis will go after blacks and prosecute them before running a really thorough investigation i agreethis case should never have been prosecuted and since it was why werent the nonblacks involved charged as well this is something we all need to be concerned about

chris longenron edith terryenron_developmentenron_development cc subject lay wto speech rob has provided everyone a new set of slides for kens speech they want ken to speak for two zero minutes once we agree on these we have to put together talking points for ken to use i would like to be at that point this wednesday so we have the rest of the week to get feed back fro ken and finalize the speech next monday or tuesday let me try out some themes we need to put energy developments in the context of globalization the worlds economy is integrating as never before as transborder trade increases capital becomes more mobile technology speeds this process to compete in this new arena countries must have access to the most talented labor the most advanced technology and the lowest cost highest quality suppliers of goods and services no where is this more critical that in the areas of energy production transportation distribution and use historically energy trade has focused on technology to explore produce and export energy in the one nine nine zero s the focus shifted to using that energy internally to fuel the tremendous economic growth experienced by developing economies the focus became infrastructure development and interregional trade as governments removed the legal and regulatory barriers to private energy and infrastructure development with energy demand increasing at high rates the potential for price increases the need to develop and use new energy technologies and the related environmental problems associated with economic development the next focus must be on opening these same economies to the world class suppliers and partners which have the intellectual property talent networks and technology to provide the answers to the more efficient production transportation and use of energy by opening their economies to an expanded trade in energy services these countries gain instant access to the skills and capabilities that have taken decades to develop elsewhere but its not just governments that benefit in the us and europe today we have seen an explosion of customer choice in their providers of products services prices and terms the service industries have led the way in providing more value at better prices this will help economies leverage their own financial technological and intellectual capabilities having put the need to have energy services on the wto agenda i would now turn the problem of defining the energy services sector i dont like the third chart energy services overview its confusing i dont know if you are listing the companies involved in services in the coalition or what i far prefer the type of chart rachel thompson uses in her environmental services presentation on page three some examples of environmental goods and services we can briefly talk about the historic issues here but also forward our recommendations on how energy services should be considered in the wto gats discussions the inclusion in the next gats round is not an end in itself but will start a process that will clarify the definition of energy services identify the barriers to trade in energy services set the goals for the desired level of market openess establish commitments on transparency due process and regulatory implementation from here we do a summary of global trends the important role energy services will play in a globalized economy how expanded trade in energy services can be a direct channel for technology transfer this is the winwin section in turning to the slides rob provided i have already mentioned my concerns about the second slide the list of members of the coalition can stay it represents the depth and variety of businesses in this area the energy and infrastructure slides fit the initial story the energy services megatrend slide has a long way to go maybe we can show the trend production and export private infrastructure development and the next step mass customization the privatization slide doesnt go here but im not sure what the point is or how we want to tie privatization to energy services the globalization slides need to go earlier if we are to use the story i outlined but the globalization of energy trade slide is about the trade in commodities it doesnt fit we are after data on the goods and services that make this trade happen not the commodity per se the customization is fine we need to have solid talking points about why customization of energy services helps economies this will be a tough section i dont think we have anything in the can exactly on this point do we need new markets for competitive energy energy outsourcing and information age are fine i like the nexus between energy and environment the talking points here should focus on this part of the energy services business ees should have lots of talking points in this area the benefits slide can be expanded i dont see the need for the fragmentation slide point on the conclusions dont be so threatening rather than say must adapt we should be talking about the benefits of embracing the new energy market add a point about rising demand environment problems the need to produce and use energy more efficiently,08:24:00,No

mneight eight nine five nine dtl more blackouts but no ransom payments for energy gougers thats a deal looking increasingly attractive to california lawmakers and consumer advocates the idea which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the cautious interest of gov gray davis is for the state to set a firm ceiling on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer and not one dime more the tradeoff would be certain blackouts possibly more than if the state continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand some advocates of the idea think that california could minimize the number of blackout hours and gain a measure of control over the energy crisis by scheduling service interruptions we need to stop this game of electricity chicken said michael shames director of the utility consumers action network which first proposed the idea we are likely to see blackouts this summer we should use them to our advantage rather than be victimized by them the plan calls for creating a buyers cartel of california oregon and washington essentially the states would decide at what price they were willing to buy power and refuse to purchase once it tops that level the state has spent six billion on energy purchases since january and at one point during last weeks power shortage was spending one nine zero zero per megawatt hour more than one zero times what davis has planned on for this summer that kind of spending cannot go on democratic assemblyman fred keeley of boulder creek said yesterday the question is can we sustain the level of spending we have and have the state maintain economic stability i believe the answer is no said keeley the lower houses main figure on energy policy and author of the bill that put the state in the powerbuying business to get this problem solved we have to think in bold terms said keeley who introduced a resolution along with fellow democratic assemblyman paul koretz of west hollywood that urged davis to form a cartel three states are better than one davis said last week that my bias would be to keep the lights on at any price but yesterday the governor said a temporary price limit is certainly a matter weve talked about and considered at some length the next step will be to see how the governors of oregon and washington respond to it a spokesman for gov gary locke of washington said the matter is being considered calls to the office of oregon gov john kitzhaber were not returned the idea has appeal among some consumers who believe as many state officials do that california is being gouged for electricity i can see if our bills were two zero or three zero more but this is ridiculous said kimberly chambers an one eight yearold fashion design student from oakland whatever it takes i dont think we should have to pay for more but yunah kim three six who moved to the bay area from new york a month ago said blackouts should not even be considered the infrastructure of government is coming apart and its the basic service government is able to provide she said businesses are not going to put up with that its very shortsighted we just have to pay until theres a solution severin borenstein director of the university of california energy institute in berkeley said blackouts might be worse than supporters of price limits believe i think they power companies would call our bluff and sell their electricity elsewhere borenstein said i dont think the state has the ability to credibly commit to paying no more than x that would be a very controversial decision legislation is already in the works to give davis the ability to enter into a west coast buyers cartel a bill sponsored by state sen dede alpert d coronado would allow the independent system operator to refuse to buy power if it is too expensive the maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula based on such things as the cost of natural gas a reasonable profit for power producers would be built in supporters said looking for some control alpert said everyone wants to avoid blackouts but that seems unlikely everybody i talked to once you establish that there will be blackouts both businesses and residents say lets have control alpert said the california manufacturers and technology association which commissioned a recent report that said unplanned blackouts could cost the state economy two one eight billion and one three five zero zero zero jobs is considering whether scheduled interruptions would be less harmful the problem if we do scheduled blackouts is that we may have an inordinate amount of blackouts said gino decaro a spokesman for the group no easy task the iso which runs the states power grid is scheduled to issue a report tomorrow on how scheduled blackouts might work sen debra bowen dmarina del ray said that planning blackouts is not as easy as it sounds the difficulty is a pragmatic one the circuits are not wired to deal with choices like we are having to make said bowen who has been holding hearings on how the state might better manage blackouts maybe we should be paying people to turn off their fuse box bowen said chronicle staff writer marsha ginsburg

the cable industry i am not registered to do enrons press for them simon said in a phone interview you have to talk to them about what they want to say to the press thats not what they want me to do unless they give me the goahead to do that enron is a one zero zero billion energy company with a broadbandservices division the company signed a videoondemand deal with blockbuster inc which

to include nondiscrimination by cable operators against unaffiliated interactivetelevision providers enron did not return phone calls seeking comment a disney official has repeatedly said that the company has made no decision about joining any openaccess or itv coalition a source who recently met with simon said the lobbyist indicated his enron job would deal with open access to cable facilities what he said suggested to me that he has had conversations with enron and disney and it does seem that those companies have something in common on open access the sources said another source said enron which owns an one eight zero zero zero mile global fiberoptic network was looking to deliver content from that plant to end users over the last mile controlled by cable and phone

two zero it felt like my arm was run ragged he said of course the knee questions will be answered the first time applewhitetwo zero takes a hit in the fall the other question the one that he cant shake two zero will take a little longer whos the starter going to be zero one applewhite or simms id be quick to drop in comments about chris hardin said of histwo zero occasional and apparently unnecessary mention of simms as a motivational two zero ploy but i think internally hed have worked that hard whatever its remarkable the way hes come back said sophomore cornerback roderic ktwo zero

at the same time majors a veteran hes beaten nebraska hes beaten them two zero all hes the same old major cornerback quentin jammer said soon applewhite will probably be as tired of talking about the quarterback two zero duel as he is about answering questions about the state of his knee now a two zero month before the freshmen report on aug one three hes talking about how hes no ttwo zero competing against simms just against himself the competitive nature that tiger woods has is the competitive nature itwo zero have applewhite said at pebble beach tiger was up one five and had a one

dont want to be a wimpy quarterback i want to betwo zero like brett favre hes not the biggest or the fastest but he can run when hetwo zero has to and he can chuck it eight zero yards its going to

energy company called enron at a time when so many oldeconomy companies seem helpless against the dizzying pace and technology of the digital age enron is demonstrating why fortune magazine keeps voting it the most innovative large company in america for years the houstonbased firm simply produced transported and marketed natural gas then as energy deregulation threatened profit margins in the gas business enron discovered it could make billions by trading and brokering packages of energy the way midwesterners do pork bellies now enron is moving into the telecommunications business with a national fiberoptic cable network and a floor bulging with sun supercomputers in fact enron may be the most interesting oldeconomy company around since moving its trading operations from the phone to the web eight months ago the company has doubled revenues to more than three zero billion most of that is made through trading everything from energy and paper to weather risk derivatives and now bandwidthmore than eight zero zero offerings in all think of ebay but instead of auctioning five used baby gap pajamas the company trades six zero zero zero zero zero blocks of natural gasand pockets commensurately huge commissions boasts enron president jeffrey skilling in terms of dollars transacted were the worlds largest online site by a factor of one zero so far this year that has meant one two zero billion in transactions and when youre running the network all sorts of profitable opportunities arise last week when word spread that naturalgas prices would spike this winter enrons inhouse traders saw their gains surge as customers raced to lock in future supplies at todays prices and enrons stock price it hit nine zero last week tripling its value of a year ago kind of like an internet play only better the market loves enron because skilling and ceo kenneth lay seem to have come up with a business model that works for just about anything they provide a service to their customers by packaging a supply of name your commodity and then using the efficiency of their vast network to beat most prices they arrived at this model back in the midone nine eight zero s almost out of desperation when crudeoil prices had collapsed naturalgas deregulation had thrown that market into chaos and the peruvian government had just nationalized enrons offshore properties figuring they might as well leverage deregulation instead of succumbing to itcall it business judo skilling a mckinsey co consultant at the time came up with a plan called the gas bank to buy up reserves of natural gas then package them for sale with various prices and conditions for different customers when electricity markets deregulated a few years ago the company did the same its the oldest concept in business buy low sell high enron also leverages its assets and expertise to provide services to big customers since one nine nine seven companies like owens corning and chase manhattan bank have signed longterm multibilliondollar contracts with enron subsidiary enron energy services ees that lock in their energy costs for up to one zero years and provide enron with a steady revenue stream whats more enron is beginning to actively manage its clients heating and cooling plants installing new equipment when necessary and monitoring it all over the internet skillings latest gambit is to apply the same principles he learned in the power and energy sectors to making enron a leader in the booming telecommunications business the plan isnt to go head to head with established fiberoptic carriers such as att qwest and williams communications instead enron wants to use new switching technology and its expertise in trading pipeline access to transform a modest telecom network into a powerful arbiter of bandwidth enrons bet is simple supply and demand will increase exponentially turning bandwidth into a tradable commodity just like gas and electricity along the way why not partner with companies such as blockbuster and use this new technology to offer contentlike movies and blow it through existing underutilized pipe they are jump starting an application telecom content with a potential market of two zero zero billion a year says tom nolle president of the telecom consulting firm cimi other neweconomy players are also beginning to see the power merchant as a prize partner ibm and aol have joined with enron to form the new power co tnpc an independent startup that will offer pricing schemes and a choice of power and gas service for residential and smallbusiness customers enron provides the electricity aol enables customers to buy it via the web and ibm takes care of the billing its ludicrous that were in the two one st century and you still have people jumping over fences to read meters says skilling pointing out that the technology exists to offer realtime pricing for gas and electricity in deregulated markets tnpc will allow consumers to switch power companies as easily as they do phone companies despite all wall streets enthusiasm for enrons bold plans there are still plenty of skeptics critics point out that there is barely a market today for the companys bandwidth trading exchange they also stress that pushing digital signals through pipe is a world away from routing natural gas although there is plenty of cable across the country carriers are not set up to mix and match access to it its a very very difficult concept says nolles even the blockbuster venture is risky technology aside there is also the highly political question of digital rights how do you satisfy hollywood that its content is secure but skilling and his lieutenants are quick to counter that everyone thought they were crazy to try to make markets in gas and electricity and enron after all is a company that thrives on entrepreneurial defiance of convention many of its new ventures were started because managers simply set new ideas in motion without waiting for approval from the top even the online operation was cobbled together in a mere seven months skilling and lay found out about enrononline only two weeks before it went live is taking risks really a part of a gaspipeline companys culture just ask john arnold the two six yearold chief of naturalgas derivatives who after nine hours and one billion in trades last wednesday had this to say

are interesting results i am on vacation next week so here are my current thoughts i am contactable on my mobile if necessary gas to power correlations i see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting var for the combined gas and power portfolio and this raises an interesting point at a conservative three zero long term correlation combined var is oone mm less than previously expected so how does this affect the limit breach strictly speaking we are still over our uk power limit but the limit was set when we were assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio var a suggested way forward given the importance of the spread options to the uk gas and power books can we allocate to the gas and power books a share of the reduction in portfolio var ie reduction portfolio var sumpower var gas var also if i understand your mail correctly matrix one implies five five gas power correlation is consistent with our correlation curves and this reduces total var by oone eight mm efa slot correlations the issue of whether our existing efa to efa correlation matrix is correct is a separate issue i dont understand where the matrix two efa to efa correlations come from but i am happy for you to run some historical correlations from the forward curves use the first two years i would suggest our original matrix was based on historicals but the analysis is worth doing again your matrix two results certainly indicate how important these correlations are closing thoughts fridays trading left us longer so i would not expect a limit breach on

hewittlonectect naveen andrewscorpenronenron david portmarket riskcorpenronenron ted murphyhouectect cc subject re var correlation scenarios everybody oliver sent us the var number for different correlations for ukpower portfolio separately from ukgas portfolio first if var is calculated accurately the correlation between power and gas curves should not affect var number for power and var number for gas only the aggregate number will be affected the changes you see are due to the fact that we use montecarlo simulation method which accuracy depends on the number of simulations even if we dont change the correlations but use different realizations of random numbers we get slightly different result from the model so to see the effect of using different correlations between gas and power we should look at the aggregate number i calculated weighted correlations based on two curves i got from paul as the weights along the term structure i used the product of price position and volatility for each time bucket for gas and each of efa slots the results are shown below inserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix produced negatively definite correlation matrix which brakes var engine correlation matrix for any set of random variables is nonnegative by definition and remains nonnegatively definite if calculated properly based on any historical data here according to our phone discussion we started experimenting with correlations assuming the same correlation for each efa slot and et elec versus gas i am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results in addition to the aggregate var numbers for the runs oliver did you can see the var numbers based on correlation matrix one and matrix two in matrix one the correlations across efa slots are identical to these in original matrix i obtained this matrix by trial and error matrix two is produces by naveen using fingers algorithm it differs from original matrix across efa slots as well as in power versus gas correlations and gives higher var than matrix one does concluding we will look at the historical forward prices and try to calculate historical correlations from them tanya oliver

the nonjurisdictional utilities that have signed a mou to develop a rto the group has met a couple of times to discuss the process they will use confidentiality agreements have been signed so no details are available but they have agreed to a voting structure for the development southern has about one third of the votes and six five of the assets and it takes at least two other parties agreeing with southern to carry a vote southern says they spent a lot of time convincing the other parties that southern was not going to run or dominate the process after that southern said the group started to pull together and get organized for the development they said everyone in the group appeared to be ready to find ways to make the rto work and resolve the hurdles the nonjurisdictional utilities have been expressing with the development of other rtos they said there were some rough spots that had to be resolved and they couldnt be sure agreement would be reached but at this point there was a lot of cooperation andy and bill wanted to convince me that this was not a delaying tactic by southern and they were doing everything possible to ensure that a complete rto filing could be ready by one two one five zero one they also said they thought this is what ed holland wanted to discuss with steve kean we talked about how other stakeholders could have input to the development they said that it was too early to make any commitment but the group had started thinking about it and they expected an input process to be available by late summer they said southern was in favor of some process that would provide stakeholders the opportunity to look at what was being considered and advise the development group as early as possible they said they understood the difficulty stakeholders had with the approach southern used in its initial filing and wanted to do it different but they pointed out again that southern could not dictate the process that would be allowed by the group in the meantime they said if we wanted to provide position papers on any part of the rto development they would make sure the papers were circulated in the group or we could continue to hold bilateral discussions with them or other members of the development group jim i still think it would be worthwhile to have a meeting between ed and steve kean and i would include you and invite andy and bill to come i dont think they want to discuss anything technical at this point they just want to convince enron that the approach southern is taking provides the quickest development of a rto for the southern area and they want any help we can give in convincing ferc to let this process run i also think we need to pass on filing a response to southerns may one five th status report either alone or with alabama municipal electric authority donna i guess thats who you meant in the memo below since aec has signed a mou with southern i will get in touch with bob reilley to find out why we havent

alabama did file comments on the may one five status report and they have asked that the ferc establish a technical conference to publicly air and evaluate the alleged governance concerns and the concerns regarding significant delay following a technical conference they ask for a judge to convene a settlement conference at ferc to undertake a properly supervised and serious development of an rto for the se without further wasted time at this point we could consider filing comments in support of the coop comments embedded stdolelink,12:59:00,"Yes

mount for sierra pacific resources acquisition of portland general appears uncertain by will mcnamara director electric industry analysis the probability appears to be getting smaller that sierra pacific resources nyse srp will complete its three one billion acquisition of portland general electric nyse pgb from enron nyse ene enron disclosed in an eight k filing with the securities and exchange commission sec on feb two seven that the sale of portland general had been delayed because of recent events in california and nevada that affected sierra pacific walt higgins chair and ceo of sierra pacific resources told wall street analysts that the acquisition agreement will terminate if it has not closed by may one analysis yesterday i wrote about the apparent collapse of the merger between consolidated edison and northeast utilities nu now another highprofile merger appears to be unraveling as with the con edison nu deal the problem facing sierra pacific resources pending purchase of portland general from enron is based in economics namely it appears that sierra pacific resources recent financial problems have cast doubt on the companys ability to complete its purchase of portland general this is not a good development for sierra pacific resources as the financial and legal implications of this potentially dead acquisition could exacerbate the companys current financial problems first let me provide some background on this deal the origin of sierra pacific resources attempt to acquire portland general date back to november one nine nine nine enron had purchased the company in one nine nine seven as a strategic move to facilitate its intent to play a major role in the retail markets of california and the pacific northwest at the time enron saw itself as a prototype for the future of the energy industry adding transmission and distribution capabilities as well as more diversified fuel resources to its already successful wholesale marketing core stymied by the slow start of competition in california and oregon enron underwent a transformation in its corporate philosophy under the growing direction of jeffrey skilling enron no longer believed that it needed to own hard assets to retain its place in the top tier of energy companies that philosophy has served enron well as its success in nearly all of its business sectors has been well documented yet enrons transformation opened the door for sierra pacific resources a relatively small and regionally based holding company to move in for a purchase of portland general owning portland general made more sense for sierra pacific resources than it did for enron portland general which provides electric service to over seven zero zero zero zero zero customers in the portlandsalem area was viewed as a good acquisition target as it would help sierra pacific resources to gain scale and a foothold in two fastgrowing states nevada and oregon sierra pacific resources agreed to pay enron two one billion for portland general which included two zero two billion in cash and assumption of enrons eight zero million merger payment obligation in addition sierra pacific resources agreed to assume one billion in portland general debt and preferred stock taking the total value of the purchase to three one billion portland general appeared happy with the scheduled sale from enron acknowledging that its own core business delivering safe and reliable power with a customer service focus was more in line with sierra pacific resources however a number of economic factors on sierra pacific resources side of the table seem to be thwarting this acquisition as i discussed in the feb two two issuealert available at wwwconsultrcicom sierra pacific resources reported a significant fourthquarter loss one eight two million as a result of soaring costs of power in the western united states the company incurred losses as a direct result of the growing and unrecovered cost of purchased power in the volatile wholesale market as a result sierra pacific resources filed with state regulators for an emergency rate increase without some rate relief the cost of fuel and power is close to crippling our ability to serve the needs of our customers said mark ruelle the companys chief financial officer the company attributed the latest quarters loss to nearly two five eight million of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs specifically sierra pacific resources reported a four q two zero zero zero loss of one eight two million or two three cents a share this compared with a profit of two six eight million or three nine cents a share excluding a five six million deferred energy writeoff a year ago including the writeoff the company reported a loss of two nine two million or four two cents a share in four q one nine nine nine for yearend two zero zero zero the company reported a net loss of three nine eight million or five one cents per share a one seven seven percent drop from one nine nine nine in addition the companys stock has fallen steadily over the last few weeks at one point dropping one one eight percent to one zero eight zero on the new york stock exchange feb seven at the close of trading on march seven shares of sierra pacific resources were priced at one three eight zero which is still down from its five two week high of one nine four three and book value of one seven eight two the drop in stock price could make it difficult for sierra pacific resources to secure the financing necessary to complete the purchase of portland general meanwhile sierra pacific resources available cash flow could be impacted by possible restrictions placed on the sale of its power plants the public utility commission of nevada pucn mandated divestiture as a condition of the one nine nine nine merger between nevada power co and sierra pacific power co which created the holding company sierra pacific resources toward that end the holding company and its wholly owned utility subsidiaries commenced a public auction of approximately two nine zero zero mw of power generation facilities of sierra pacific resources nine power plants which are mostly fired by natural gas and coal seven have been entered into sales agreements to companies such as dynegy and nrg and will be sold upon final regulatory approval however over the last few weeks there has been growing concern that nevada regulators would not approve pending sales or authorize the sale of additional power plants by sierra pacific resources thus preventing the company from using the proceeds to pay for the acquisition of portland general perhaps out of fears about depleting the nevadas power supply the attorney generals bureau of consumer protection the southern nevada water authority and the aflcio have urged that the sale of the plants be delayed or canceled further nevada governor kenny guinn has called on the pucn to reconsider the one nine nine nine order that required sierra pacific resources to sell the plants owned by its two utilities nevada power and sierra pacific power any available cash that sierra pacific resources was planning to use from the power plant sales to support its acquisition of portland general may not materialize if the sales agreements are delayed or terminated ironically nevada power and sierra pacific power co just received approval from the pucn to secure one four billion in bank loans bond financing and preferred securities however due to agreements that the utilities previously made none of the borrowed money may be used directly or indirectly to financially support its parents acquisition of portland general thus sierra pacific resources seems to be between a rock and a hard place regarding this purchase which it apparently still wants to complete it would appear that sierra pacific resources will have difficulty financing the purchase of portland general due to the combination of its significant financial losses plunging stock prices and possible restrictions against the sale of its power plants presumably these are the recent events to which enron referred in its sec filing it is fairly clear that enron no longer wishes to own portland general and believes that the company does not fit into its strategy for continuing growth what remains in question however is what will happen if sierra pacific resources pending acquisition is not completed by the may one deadline thus terminating the sales agreement the problems associated with the con edison nu merger are leading to litigation one cant help but think that lawsuits would be inevitable in the enron portland general sierra pacific resources case as well as enron presumably would seek to be compensated in some way for the three one billion that the deal includes further complicating matters for sierra pacific resources is a growing movement to municipalize the electric markets in las vegas and henderson nev on jan one one the southern nevada water authority suggested that the agency could become a public power authority pat mulroy general manager of the water authority recommended that the agency buy power on wholesale markets and possibly generate electricity from some of its own power plants to serve cities in the area efforts to municipalize electric systems in the southern half of the state could potentially gain momentum if sierra pacific resources financial problems worsen an archive list of previous issuealerts is available at wwwconsultrcicom image the most comprehensive uptodate map of

enron corps stock and bond prices took another beating after the energy companys release late monday of its muchanticipated thirdquarter financial filing with the securities and exchange commission which revealed potentially major new cashflow and earnings headaches as of four pm in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday enron shares were at six nine nine one down two zero seven or two three enron once again topped the big boards mostactive list with eight nine nine million shares traded more than twice the volume of the next most active stock enron bond prices fell into the range of between seven zero cents and eight zero cents on the dollar according to market observers following the announcement earlier this month of dynegy incs plan to purchase enron for around one zero billion in stock bond prices had firmed to above eight zero cents on the dollar yesterday a dynegy spokesman wouldnt comment on the status of the pending acquisition other than to say his company was reviewing enrons thirdquarter financial report filed with the sec as part of continuing due diligence under the proposed acquisition dynegy would exchange zero two six eight five of its shares for each enron share based on dynegys four pm price yesterday on the big board of four one seven zero a share off one nine zero the deal values enron shares at about one one two zero well above the current market price mondays thirdquarter financial report from enron which supplemented and revised enrons earnings announcement last month reinforced fears that the energytrading company is in a precarious financial position and will be for awhile said andre meade head of us utility research at commerzbank securities as reported in the wall street journal enrons sec filing monday said that because of the companys deteriorated credit standing it might have to repay a six nine zero million note by this coming monday the filing also said enron might be forced to take a seven zero zero million pretax charge to earnings in the current quarter ending dec three one due to a drop in value of some of its assets houstonbased enron has been in deepening financial distress for the past month since announcing big asset and shareholderequity reductions in the third quarter much of the turmoil has been caused by the companys dealings with partnerships headed by former enron officers including its former chief financial officer those dealings are the subject of a formal sec investigation enrons financial woes have also led to a reduced level of transaction activity with the company by trading partners the sec filing said how well or poorly enrons energytrading volume holds up is the milliondollar question said simmons co analyst jeff dietert enrons trading operation has been the companys main profit engine and the major attraction for dynegy in the acquisition deal yesterday other major energytrading companies said they were still doing business with enron but were closely monitoring the firms condition standard poors ratings group also reaffirmed enrons credit ratings even though it said mondays sec filings raise liquidity issues for the company copyright two

bloomberg enron corp the largest energy trader seeks to export electricity from bulgaria to italy dnevnik daily reported citing unidentified sources from the state energy agency enron as well as two german companies including vdeg will be invited to bid at a tender for the national electricity company to select energy trading partners the paper said enron is being bought by rival dynegy inc for about two zero billion currently nec ead is the sole exporter of electricity from bulgaria which provides energy to most of its neighbors including serbia macedonia montenegro greece kosovo albania and turkey last year the country exported electricity worth one one seven million to turkey alone opening the energy market to competition is part of the requirements for bulgaria to join the european union the international monetary fund which is expected to provide one five zero million to bulgaria over the next year also insisted on reorganization of the energy industry raymond james analyst cartwright comments on enron disclosure two zero zero one one one two one zero seven four five new york new york nov two one bloomberg jon kyle cartwright a senior vice president and senior energy analyst at raymond james associates inc in st petersburg florida comments on the enron corps disclosure that it may have to repay a six nine zero million note next week following the downgrade of its credit ratings to the lowest investmentgrade level the houstonbased energy trader made the disclosure in a filing with the securities and exchange commission known as a one zero q on monday i have to believe that dynegy knew about this maybe not when the deal was signed but certainly before the one zero q was published there was wiggle room in the deal for both write downs which effectively includes both the note and the potential write down for whitewing there still appears to be enough liquidity to handle the write offs and the six nine zero million limited partnership note over the shortrun the rest of this week it is going to be difficult for anyone to trade with enron because they should be generally concerned that neither enron nor dynegy has made public comments on this one zero q if it is only for a few days were ok as long as dynegy doesnt pull out of this deal we should be ok and enron should maintain its investment grade rating and all the enron corp bonds should mature without incident hopefully the company will comment shortly if there has ever been a company that couldnt afford to disclose a time bomb in a one zero q it is enron this should have been disclosed prior to this it added to the crisis of confidence we believe the company will be able to satisfy the six nine zero million note it appears they should be able to do it from existing liquidity they could renegotiate the note andor the other bank facilities that would be jeopardized if they default on the note even our buy recommendation on the enron notes is based on our belief that dynegys management is credible because enrons lost all credibility with this disclosure on the possibility that enron may be downgraded to junk ratings nothings too big to fail and pge proved that the core business at enron is the trading operation and it is difficult for people to trade with any firm particularly an energy trader if there is any concern they wont be able to deliver on their side of the trade enron stock punishment deepens debt woes cast pall over merger by tom fowler copyright two zero zero one houston chronicle november two one two zero zero one the continuing stream of surprises from the depths of enron corps balance sheet is putting a strain on dynegys plans to buy its beleaguered competitor but analysts say the deal remains on track enrons share price dropped two three percent tuesday to six nine nine after news the company had to restate its thirdquarter earnings and would need to pay off or renegotiate a six nine zero million iou by monday the changes came just five days after enron executives told analysts in a conference call they believed most of the charges related to special financing partnerships had been disclosed the fact that enron is still capable of pulling new rabbits out of their hat would make me think dynegy would question their future earnings even more said prudential securities analyst carol coale referring to the big income benefit dynegy hopes to reap from the deal but at this point dynegy says theyre still going forward so i still have a positive outlook on it closing the six nine zero million note payable which is related to a natural gas partnership in brazil had been reported earlier but the fact that it would come due almost immediately if the companys credit rating was downgraded to bbb which happened nov one two was news to analysts and to dynegy enron spokesman mark palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended negotiations are under way to do so he said the surprise surrounding the early deadline for the note was likely because of high turnover in enrons accounting department said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey in a report tuesday but he believes the debt was taken into account by dynegy in merger negotiations the latest twists while negative are not however likely to turn into a tornado and are not dealbreakers in our opinion eassey said at the level enron is being purchased dynegy had clearly bakedin these types of uncertainties into its purchase price enron is also feeling pressure because some of its energy trading partners are either cutting back on the amount of business they do with the company or keeping close watch of enrons credit rating officials with mirant corp and aquila said they have cut back on trading while houstonbased reliant resources is watching the situation carefully were being cautious monitoring our position with them very closely said joe bob perkins president of reliant resources wholesale business but i dont think that today feels significantly different than it felt a week ago perkins said reliant officials read enrons one zero q filing the questions we had about that we addressed with enron perkins said he said the fuss over the one zero q seemed to be coming more from the press than the energy trading industry and said any slowdown in overall trading in the market may have more to do with the season than problems at enron it looks more like the preholiday norm than anything fundamentally different because of enron perkins said that doesnt mean analysts are resting easy commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said in a report that although the one zero q sheds more light on enron finances the information continues to be released piecemeal making it likely more surprises are in store overall we believe the filing clearly shows that enron remains in a precarious financial position and its status as a going concern is much in doubt meade said enron has about one five billion in cash and about three billion in recently negotiated revolving credit lines as well as eight zero zero million in asset sales pending and another five zero zero million to one billion in equity investment expected soon that could disappear in a hurry however if the companys credit rating drops one notch to belowinvestment grade that would trigger several partnership contracts that would force the company to repay or refinance up to four billion in debt credit rating agency standard poors said tuesday it was maintaining enrons rating but prudentials coale is concerned the real crisis is in six months when almost four billion in debt is expected to mature she said its not fatalistic but it is dire watchdog group nixes request to probe enron audit woes by judith burns of dow jones newswires one one two one two zero zero one dow jones news service copyright c two zero zero one dow jones company inc this report was originally published late tuesday washington dow jones an accounting industry watchdog says it wont probe auditing problems at enron corp ene despite a request from a senior house democrat but the group the public oversight board says it may take a broader look at what is causing a rash of audit blowups investigation of the enron situation rests with the sec chairman charles bowsher said in an interview tuesday we cant run a separate investigation the securities and exchange commission is examining accounting and audit problems at enron of houston focusing on investments in limited partnerships tied to former chief financial officer andrew fastow enron has acknowledged it overstated net income by five eight six million and will need to restate five years worth of financial reports citing concerns about the accounting industrys peer review process rep john dingell dmich asked the public oversight board to conduct a special investigation of arthur andersen llp and its audit work for enron bowsher said the oversight board wont open a special investigation leaving that to the sec and the industrys quality control inquiry committee but will decide at its next meeting whether to take a hard look at recent highprofile audit debacles were probably going to want to look at some of these major audit failures and thats not limited to andersen bowsher said he cited recent audit failures involving cendant corp cd microstrategy inc mstr sunbeam corp and waste management inc wmi saying i think we ought to look at them all former sec chief accountant lynn turner expressed disappointment at the oversight boards reluctance to exercise its investigative muscle given a rash of financial restatements and frauds that have cost investors upwards of one zero zero billion in recent years in light of losses that have reached the magnitude of the savings and loan debacle its time for the pob to start carrying out investigations of whats happening at the audit firms turner said turner said dingell is right to question the accounting professions ability to police itself through socalled peer reviews saying recent audit failures are evidence that the peer review process is not as robust as it needs to be theres an incentive built into the system that says dont tell on me and i wont tell on you turner said firms that audit public companies must undergo peer review every three years subjecting their work to scrutiny by a competing audit firm or a panel appointed by the american institute of certified public accountants in practice the big five firms hire each other to conduct the oversight with no requirement to rotate assignments and critics say reviewers arent as probing as they could or should be theres a tendency in the peer reviews even when problems are identified to regard them as isolated instances not evidence of a systemic failure at an audit firm said douglas carmichael an accounting professor at baruch college in new york since peer reviews began in one nine seven eight no big five firm has received a qualified opinion of its audit work he added its just not going to happen pob chairman bowsher defends peer reviews as a very rigorous thorough process but concedes they havent prevented a recent bout of problematic audits he suggested they may be due to a combination of factors from bad judgment on the part of individual partners to questions about applying accounting and auditing standards audit failures are the exception not the rule bowsher stressed of the more than one zero zero zero zero audits done each year only about five zero generate legal claims requiring referral to the aicpas quality control inquiry committee and bowsher estimates no more than a few dozen involve major failings in enrons case the quality control inquiry committee composed of about a dozen cpas will investigate andersens audit work but critics doubt it will do much digging my personal opinion is that they rely way too much on what the firm tells them rather than conducting their own investigation said carmichael he said inquiry committees also are hamstrung because they lack the power to subpoena evidence or witnesses any disciplinary measures recommended by the inquiry committee will be kept private as is customary leaving investors with no sense of how the matter is resolved despite former sec chairman arthur levitts push for public representation on aicpa committees carmichael said its pretty much an inhouse closed affair judith burns dow jones newswires two zero two eight six two six six nine two judithburnsdowjonescom

company had to restate its thirdquarter earnings and would need to pay off or renegotiate a six nine zero million iou by monday the changes came just five days after enron executives told analysts in a conference call they believed most of the charges related to special financing partnerships had been disclosed the fact that enron is still capable of pulling new rabbits out of their hat would make me think dynegy would question their future earnings even more said prudential securities analyst carol coale referring to the big income benefit dynegy hopes to reap from the deal but at this point dynegy says theyre still going forward so i still have a positive outlook on it closing the six nine zero million note payable which is related to a natural gas partnership in brazil had been reported earlier but the fact that it would come due almost immediately if the companys credit rating was downgraded to bbb which happened nov one two was news to analysts and to dynegy enron spokesman mark palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended negotiations are under way to do so he said the surprise surrounding the early deadline for the note was likely because of high turnover in enrons accounting department said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey in a report tuesday but he believes the debt was taken into account by dynegy in merger negotiations the latest twists while negative are not however likely to turn into a tornado and are not dealbreakers in our opinion eassey said at the level enron is being purchased dynegy had clearly bakedin these types of uncertainties into its purchase price enron is also feeling pressure because some of its energy trading partners are either cutting back on the

the fuss over the one zero q seemed to be coming more from the press than the energy trading industry and said any slowdown in overall trading in the market may have more to do with the season than problems at enron it looks more like the preholiday norm than anything fundamentally different because of enron perkins said that doesnt mean analysts are resting easy commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said in a report that although the one zero q sheds more light on enron finances the information continues to be released piecemeal making it likely more surprises are in store overall we believe the filing clearly shows that enron remains in a precarious financial position and its status as a going concern is much in doubt meade said enron has about one five billion in cash and about three billion in recently negotiated revolving credit lines as well as eight zero zero million in asset sales pending and another five zero zero million to one billion in equity investment expected

of enrons largest energytrading competitors besides dynegys continued commitment to the merger analysts and industry executives said the most crucial issue for enron was restoring the confidence of investors and trading partners in its financial health the restatement of earnings two weeks ago and other disclosures about complex dealings with partnerships some of them run by enrons former chief financial officer had prompted the major creditrating agencies to rate enrons bonds at the lowest investmentgrade level if the rating agencies take them below investment grade they cant do business anymore the rival executive said yesterday thats become almost conventional wisdom another downgrade could force enron to pay or refinance up to three nine billion in debt and it could prompt other energy traders to halt dealings with the company entirely in fact standard poors one of the major creditrating agencies gave enron something of a vote of confidence yesterday while it will continue to review the company for a potential downgrade s p said it expects enrons nearterm financial health to be sufficient to carry the company through the completion of its proposed merger with dynegy s p

would need to meet its obligations ms coale noted that the six nine zero million obligation whose disclosure shook the markets yesterday was set off by a credit downgrade on nov one two two days

analytics which aggregates insidertrading data last months ratio of sellers to buyers ranked by dollar value was one two sold for every dollar bought in line with the fiveyear average the ratio had

profits from the bounce weve had in the market insider data analysts however will be keeping a close eye on the november numbers to see if that trend holds one explanation for the relatively light selling in october could be company restrictions on insider transactions ahead of thirdquarter earnings reports in light of that said mr gerber we would expect to see a bit of an increase in sales on

kevin drawbaugh washington nov two zero reuters the regulatory panel that oversees big us accounting firms plans to discuss concerns about its peer review process and other issues at its next meeting in december the panels chairman said on tuesday amid growing concern about the enron corp debacle and the accountants involved in it public oversight board chairman charles bowsher said theres just a lot of problems in this enron case some really significant problems many of them were raised in a letter sent recently to bowsher by rep john dingell who called on the board to investigate arthur andersen auditor to enron the houston energy trader rocked in past weeks by a series of setbacks including a securities and exchange commission investigation the investigation of this situation is one being done by the sec the pob does not do individual investigations bowsher said in a telephone interview with reuters but he added that dingell did raise other issues in his letter that get to our responsibilities like the overall quality of the processes and standards that the firms use thats what weve got to look at and deal with dingell a michigan democrat specifically questioned a peer review system overseen by the board which the congressman complained has never resulted in a qualified review being filed by one major accounting firm about another very good processes very good people bowsher confirmed dingells assertion but added that a qualified review of one firm by another would be drastic and likely has not been deserved by any of the nations biggest accounting firms since the review process started in one nine seven eight what there have been as part of these peer reviews is recommendations in areas that need to be improved he said the real facts of life are these big firms have very good processes they hire very good people they train them very well and they have one zero zero zero zero audits that go well each year but theres no question weve had a series of big problem audits that bring the whole process into concern we cant ignore the fact that weve had these thats one of the things were going to be thinking a lot about at our december meeting enrons stock price has plunged several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending in the wake of revelations about certain unusual deals with outside partnerships involving company officers enron earlier this month said it planned to be acquired by dynegy inc critics have said arthur andersen should have done more as enrons auditor to draw investors attention to the companys unusual finances similar complaints have been voiced in recent years about the performance of auditors of other companies in june arthur andersen was fined seven million by the sec to settle

and that can spell trouble and following up on a financial times scoop we brought you yesterday there are mounting fears that dynegy url httpwwwdynegycom could abandon its proposed bid for enron lets get michael heims ph thoughts on those issues hes an energy analyst at ag edwards thanks for joining us we appreciate it michael heim ag edwards my pleasure francis first of all lets get the latest here your analysis of the latest news that they did restate their earnings and they might be having some difficulty meeting their obligations here how do you add that up heim well enron filed their one zero q last night as i think everyone knows and it did include a modest restatement but i dont really think thats the big news more of concern is the debt obligation that you talked about although even that is six nine zero million is manageable but i think the one zero k filing has addressed many of the previous concerns about some of these limited related party partnership that enron has and the obligations the backstopping enron has provided with those partnerships hays michael could you just tell us a little bit more about that because it it i get its so complicated i really have you know have a hard time following it after a while and what i cant understand is presumably the reason they were opposing this deal dynagy and enron is that dynagy knew what was going on figured they were a lot of deals like this so one im kind of surprised that they would be talking about maybe triggering the material adverse charge at this point which could get them out of the deal i mean they say theyre not going to do it but bankers say theyre talking about it so whats going on here heim well its not unusual for deals to have a material adverse condition clause and there was a lot thats unknown in enron its a very difficult company to follow and dynagy certainly has done a lot of due diligence but it was in a crash period and im sure theres a lot of questions dynagy has with enron as well the dynagy was very careful on how they worded the deal and left themselves some outs and i dont know if theyre going to try and take advantage of those outs but certainly im sure they share a lot of the concerns that enron investors have francis is there another shoe to drop next week when these obligations come due on the two six th heim well francis and should we be braced for another big day in for enron stock or has it found a basement heim well thats a very tough question to answer certainly anybody whos been negative on the stock has done so not because they knew there were some problems coming but because they didnt know that there werent problems coming and i certainly cant say that there isnt other problems that could be disclosed yes in situations like this you have to rely a little bit on the company and unfortunately the companys reputations already been stained francis michael you got a sell on the stock is there a point at which this issue becomes attractive or are there just too many potential bodies buried here heim well im a firm believer theres always a point at which stock becomes attractive but at this point its really become a betting game on whether the deal gets done and there are certainly people a lot of people speculating on that both sides and as an analyst i dont know if you necessarily have a more insight to that type of question than somebody else its not a bet that we want to take at these prices hays ok well michael hime you certainly certainly got a lot of reasons i guess not to take the bet certainly not before you have

welcome to the program floyd norris financial editor the new york times thank you romans this has been a fascinating story and stock to watch develop first off what is the latest that drove this stock down more than two zero percent again today norris well yesterday after the close they filed a report with the securities and exchange commission and as people studied it overnight they were quite surprised and it got worse this morning they disclosed that they have six nine zero million in debt so they may have to pay next week if they cant either come up with collateral which will not be easy or persuade the lenders to renegotiate and what was shocking about that wasnt that the debt existed that was known it was that they had to pay it so quickly it turns out according to what people are telling analysts that dynegy company dynegy inc ticker dyn url httpwwwdynegycom which agreed to buy them only a week or two ago didnt know about this they had not told them apparently enron didnt realize they had this problem romans ok wait there seems to be a lot of things that wall street didnt know was going on and every sort of revelation is a big blow to the stock who is watching whats happening here and how can there be so many surprises thats confusing to a lot of folks who are following this norris well itsthe fact wall street is surprised isnt necessarily surprising but the fact that enron seems to have been surprised is surprising theyve had a lot of turnover it reinforces the suspicion that jeff skilling the chief executive officer who quit in midyear and perhaps the treasury and chief financial officer both of whom were ousted within the last month as this crisis grew may have been the only people who really understood what was going on there and that makes you wonder what else might yet come out romans well what about auditors and what about the board governing this firm and what about ken lay i mean he is sort of the statesman of the industry isnt he and hes running this company again norris well hes back running the company the suspicion is and lay denies it he says he knows whats going on my suspicion is that he didnt know the details he trusted he understood the company was overvalued probably this is a man who was taking out hundreds of millions of dollars by selling stock exercising stock options and selling stock but i suspect he didnt understand all of the details and now they are coming back to haunt him the other thing that is bothering people today is these numbers show the company is burning through cash at an amazing rate and enron has not really given us a good understanding of why they are burning through the cash that fast but it raises questions about whether the company can continue operating until its supposed to be taken over by dynegy by next september and of course the way the stock is trading its obvious that a lot of people on wall street doubt that deal will go through or at least doubt that it will go through on the announced terms tracy eichler ubs painewebber floyd my question regarding shareholder lawsuits it seems like theres some validity there any new news on the sec investigation and the magnitude to those lawsuits norris theres no news on the sec investigation there are of course huge shareholder lawsuits theyre filed against enron theyre filed against the current and former officers of the company and theyre filed against arthur andersen which audited this company the accounting regulators are already starting to check in again on arthur andersen which used to be the class of the accounting business and has had a string of recent embarrassments romans all right floyd norris for the new york times thank you so much for joining us norris thank you,06:30:37,No

who are most likely to see quick action brown said redshirt freshman tillman holloway probably will start at left guard but he said derrick dockery who had been starting before missing some practice because of a large cyst will play a lot too defensive coordinator carl reese said sophomore de cole pittman has been playing really well if he keeps playing like he has well probably move him over to the other end as the starter and have jermain anderson be a swing guy who can substitute at either end pittman has been backing up cory redding at right end he might start at right end saturday because redding also has missed some practice with a knee sprain but reese said redding and pittman are my two best ends right now so i might move pittman im still not happy with the end play but well keep working on it texas has nine defensive starters back but the two regulars who graduated were des aaron hmphrey and cedric woodard brown said he is pleased with the team leadership on defense and he said the offense seems to be developing more leadership he also said he is pleased with the way the team has worked in the record heat in austin one one zero on monday and one one two on tuesday

cpjohnsonbrobeckcom subject sempra tax rate greg and chris as best we can tell sempra is not in a position currently to use section two nine tax credits this is based on the following bits of evidence one a company cannot claim section two nine tax credits in years when it pays no taxes or pays them under the alternative minimum tax rather than the regular corporate income tax two section two nine credits cannot be carried forward a company must use them or lose them the one exception is in a year when the company is on the alternative minimum tax the credit turns into a socalled amt credit and can be carried forward it must be used in that case in the first year the company comes off the amt three it appears from sempras one zero k that it was in a net operating loss position in two zero zero zero the company shows current federal income taxes of eight million it also shows deferred federal income taxes last year of two zero seven million according to morris meltzer tax director at pges unregulated affiliate this means that the company had more book income than taxable income last year the deferred tax liability reflects the taxes the company expects to have to pay in the future as a result of this disparity four sempras one zero q for the first quarter two zero zero one shows positive current tax liability of seven four million however jack casey vice chairman of meridian investments told me that sempra expects to be in a net operating loss position for the year meridian has been hired by sempra to sell sempras interest in the carbonronics syncoal facilities i asked casey why sempra wants to sell is it because it cant use the tax credits or because it has soured on investing in syncoal projects given all the bad publicity casey said it cannot use the tax credits in other news the irs has not budged on its plan to limit the capacity of plants to which it issues rulings to absurdly low numbers the industry has complained to the treasury and there have been discussions at senior levels of treasury and the irs but no reports back on where these internal talks are headed detroit edison has a meeting with the irs on its ruling request next tuesday the irs has said it will limit capacity at the dte facility to one nine eight zero zero zero tons a year i assume you saw the article last thursday in the wall street journal about syncoal projects it was on the front page as far as i can tell all proposed sales of syncoal plants in the market are on hold this is a consequence of the wall street journal article and the impasse with the irs over capacity the industry is starting to think it may have won a political battle earlier this year at treasury but lost the war the irs bureaucrats will have the final say joe makurath the irs rulings group chief said he is getting a number of foia requests for documents about projects on which the irs has already ruled he said he intends to be liberal in releasing information there are rumors that the wall street journal may be one of the organizations seeking information and may be at work on a followup article the irs launched an audit of four projects in west virginia and virginia that many people consider to be on the best end of the spectrum the projects already have rulings that they qualify for credits the irs appears to be gathering evidence to argue that they did not get into service in time to qualify for tax credits or else that the projects failed to comply with the rulings it is sending out big guns from chicago and one agent told the taxpayer that the irs national office said
