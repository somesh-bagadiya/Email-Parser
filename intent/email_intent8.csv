cos prices by locking in a fixed rate for gas that wont fluctuate with market changes some regulators and consumer advocates however say it may not be a good deal only about seven four zero zero zero of pges four million residential power customers proved adventurous enough to switch when companies such as green mountain set up shop as alternative electricity suppliers under the states deregulation experiment and that retail choice program for electricity may soon be suspended a casualty of the energy crisis but people are free to make private deals for natural gas which has long been deregulated newpower based in new york state is the first energy firm to set up as an alternative supplier in california for households that now buy from the utilities newpower is betting that residents are in no mood to take a chance that pge gas rates have stabilized after the spikes that drove bills up by hundreds of dollars last winter the firm is offering contracts at a set rate for two years even if market prices shoot through the roof again you still keep the same reliable service from pge says a newpower ad placed in california newspapers you just pay a lot less for the gas newpower has also peppered pge customers with solicitation letters though the company wont say how many it has sent out it also wont say how many utility customers have switched newpowers naturalgas deal should be closely scrutinized by anyone thinking of signing on say state regulatory officials and consumer advocates this month for example the price being charged by newpower for gas is more than double pges september rate and the newpower rates could remain higher than pges through the winter if the utilitys rate forecasts prove accurate right now the price is fairly low newpower spokeswoman gael doar said of pges rate of five two cents per unit of gas for september but earlier this year the price was higher than one four zero in fact pges recordsetting peak rate in january was one seven seven but gas prices have plummeted and newpowers critics say they are unlikely to reach the same record highs this winter the stable rate under both plans offered by newpower tops pges average charges during the height of the energy crisis a chronicle analysis found pges average cost per unit of gas from june two zero zero zero to may two zero zero one was one one zero when all charges are included the cost per unit of gas is a flat one two two under one newpower plan and an average of one one six under another doar said newpower customers will save because they will avoid price spikes during the winter when households use the bulk of their gas if consumers are worried about prices going up like they did last year our product might appeal to them doar said harry snyder of consumers union in san francisco said he doesnt buy it theyre trying to lock you in now at a rate that is already high but will be way too high shortly snyder said he said newpowers marketing letter also makes it hard for people to make a cost comparison the letters reassure customers that pge will still deliver their gas through utility pipelines repair the lines answer service calls and read their meters but they dont talk about the fact that youll have to pay pge to do that snyder said newpowers marketing letter promoting its seasonal saver plan which offers a rate of eight seven cents for most of the year and three five cents for three summer months makes no mention of an additional three six cent fee that customers must pay pge he said doar said newpower wasnt trying to confuse people were very careful in terms of making sure the consumers understand what they have to pay doar said our letters have to be approved by the puc but trina horner a naturalgas adviser to loretta lynch president of the state public utilities commission said no one at the puc has reviewed the mailer i dont know what newpower is talking about when they said we approved the letter she said the puc has no regulations requiring alternative gas providers to register file their contracts and honor them or submit their marketing materials or business plans for review horner said those who went outside pge to buy their electricity were dumped back on the utility when prices soared last winter but doar said newpowers gas customers wont have to worry about that she said the companys contracts bar it from unloading residential customers unless emergencies such as pipeline breaks make it impossible to deliver gas snyder said evaluating such contracts requires people to predict gas prices like an energy expert a job that he said is better left for utilities to do on their behalf hey its me against enron snyder said thats not a fair matchup im going to get beat every time

washington sept one zero bloomberg about two zero zero representatives of utilities power marketers and regulators in the southeastern us couldnt agree on the form a sole regional electricity grid operator should take though four five days of mediated talks ended with an outline of two possible models a judge said federal energy regulatory commission administrative judge bobbie mccartney presented the two models to the commission saying ferc should quickly tell participants which it favors she said she recommends the proposal that would set up a forprofit transmission company and gives key functions to a nonprofit market administrator it has the broadest support she said ferc wants as few as four regional grid operators to replace dozens of local transmission systems saying consolidation would boost competition expand available energy supplies and discourage grid manipulation by utilities in the southeast where power is generally cheaper utilities and state regulators are resisting the move claiming it could boost power bills absent clear commission endorsement of its preferred model impasse will continue with the parties polarized to their respective models mccartney wrote in her one three three page report the southwest power pool inc which ferc directed to participate in the talks failed to agree on a plan with any of the other organizations and decided to enter into talks to form a midwest regional organization the judge said the southwest power pool covers oklahoma kansas and parts of arkansas louisiana mississippi missouri and new mexico northeast ferc ordered the talks in july between southern co entergy inc and other groups that have proposed several smaller transmission groups in the southeast utilities and other parties that participated in the ferc talks agreed not to discuss the negotiations until after the judge issued her report an entergy spokeswoman said her company was still reviewing the report and a call to southern for comment wasnt returned the commissioners have called for similar negotiations in the northeast and said they may require discussions aimed at forming grid operators in the west and midwest most of texas is separate from the national grid and wont be required to participate other participants in the mediation included representatives from gridsouth a grid group proposed between progress energy incs carolina power light duke energy corp and scana corps south carolina electric gas co and gridflorida llc a transmission group of florida power and light co tampa electric co and florida power corp judge mccartney said the favored plan is a consolidation of aspects of the proposals submitted by gridflorida gridsouth and entergy the second plan contains many of the aspects of the model proposed by southern she said the ferc and many power suppliers say the southeast is a natural market for wholesale power and its grid should be operated by a single organization electricity generators and marketers support a small number of grid operators because it will reduce the fees they pay to move power from one area to another enron corp the largest us electricity trader said in a filing to ferc that the southeast needs a single organization capable of ensuring the security and reliability of the regional transmission grid as well as efficient market development in the region an independent analysis submitted by enron shows most of the southeastern utilities power sales are to each other or to market trading affiliates inside the proposed region smaller control areas within the region wont be able to manage power flows as market activity continues to expand in the region according to the analysis the judge in charge of the northeast mediation efforts which finished on friday is due to report on the progress of those talks on oct one seven the talks sought to link grid operators new england independent system operator new york iso and pjm interconnection

morning here are my notes did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order the call began with watson bergstrom and whalley reading from prepared statements watson spoke for c one zero minutes bergstrom for five and whalley spoke for perhaps three zero seconds dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them specific points ees will be a part of the new company enron assets will be revalued at closing the investment in northern natural takes the form of convertible preferred if the merger does not go through dynegy has the right to acquire northern for very little additional consideration if dyn terminates the merger and ene has sufficient liquidity ene has right to repurchase the convertible preferred debtequity of combined company expected to be four five both companies will remain on ratingswatch negative chevrontexaco will hold one six nine mm shares out of a total six five zero mm shares of the postmerger entity watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and offbalancesheet leverage in what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings rumors that dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to enron are not true dynegy owed enron five zero mm lay says that enron had other options particularly financial all of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way lay had the spes been capitalized with perhaps three zero mm more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the spes dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at enron and thus dynene cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there doty dynegy cfo says that late last week ene had close to a billion in cash osprey will be unwound late next summer marlin will be unwound after closing many of the offbalancesheet structures including the creditlinked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing with regard to ene asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible however doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ene will renew its three six four day facility believe this is the three bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next six eight weeks bbbflat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies mcmahon says no comment to wsj article indicating that enes banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ene in the next few weeks consolidation of trading activity mid and backoffice consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing ees nng and tw have no real overlap with existing dyn activity so there wont be much integration work required there the big integration effort will be ena watson says that the creative financing surrounded noncore assets doty adds that frankly dyn assigned zero economic value to noncore businesses in their valuation model they bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the noncore assetsbusinesses and left it at that watson mentions that dyn would not have gotten involved with enron had they not been approached by enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with dyn to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger watsondoty said that theyre not one zero zero sure that no surprises remain in enrons booksbut that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling the deal does have materialadversechange outs for dynegy covering any mac regarding enrons assets or businesses dynegys lawyers indicated that the mac language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops three five bn prior to closing mcmahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ene international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list the merger structure calls for a new entity to take over enron enron is planning to hold an enronspecific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for wednesday initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities mcmahon acknowledges that enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to yearend had the merger not materialized dynegys earnings guidance places enronrelated earnings accretion at zero nine zero zero nine five which represents a two five haircut to enron internal estimates doty says that this is all operating earningsfigure does not include any amounts from expected synergies doty says that both enron and dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively shortterm in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash chevrontexacos investment in dynegy was calculated at a five discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed given the runup in dynegy stock last week chevrontexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices chevrontexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better no further clarification given whalley believes that well retain the enron traders and marketers theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner they have talked with most of the enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination they will be working with the enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions he says that to the extent necessary yes watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of dyn and enethere will be more of an assetbacked trading focus but by the same token the new dynegy will be involved in much more financial marketmaking trading than the dynegy of today watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player he does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well give me a call if youd like me to try to clarify any of these comments patrick tucker xthree three zero five

litigation or arbitration what concerns me however is his advice that politically it is not the time to seek assistance fromthe president for the consent that there is a political battle in the senate and that we should wait until the end of february to seek political assistance my view on that is to wait four more weeks to progress with this notice of default when the nine zero day cure period has expired plus the three zero day extension which has also expired sends the wrong message and weakens our position thus it is my recommendation that we proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under clause two seven paragraph two of the ppa which then requires a three zero day consultation period paragraphthree at the end of which we have the option to terminate this buys us a little time but keeps the pressure on at the end of which we can initiate proceedings to compel the consent or to terminate im not sure what reaction the notice to terminate could bring about from furnas im not sure how that plays out in our settlement with siemans consider also that the commercial people are not comfortable with termination yet i am not sure what rights if any we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may affect our position in arbitration or litigation something we need to look at under the contract although i cannot immediately recall any deadlines or express waivers related to timing in this regard i committed that we would advise the team on the next call next thursday our recommendation with respect to arbitrationlitigation i want to make sure they understand every possibility so they can make an informed decision you have the matrix developed already if you want to expand on that or handle that your own way bestard opines that furnas will fight hard that they have traditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative ill find out who represents them three force majeure furnas is also taking a very strong position that epe does not have a valid force majeure claim based on my reading of the contract our facts appear to fit squarely under clause nine five c however im told we did not comply strictly to the notice terms well need to show that we were not negligent as a cause for the attorney generals action laine powell president of the cuiaba companies will gather the information on our force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our position note that if fm lasts more than one two consecutive months both parties have the right to terminate no one buys the plant and were stuck ill find out the date of our last fm notice there have been several four budget lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week what it will cost to prepare for arbitration and the cost of the arbitration darren ill call you tomorrow and we can break that out we may want to consider the litigation route well need to put together some kind of proposed or potential time line and what will happen in each stage and tie a number to it ive done this with pete before and he seems to like it it needs to be subject to review as we go along five next prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place im going to get together all our opinions on the brazilian state of arbitration and get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best advice we certainly have some conflicting views our experience in the brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years so i am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in the court anyway if we go to court perhaps furnas would take the position that we must arbitrate that is what fernando serec said who knows please give me your comments or just call me im open to any suggestions john novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that i may be unaware of with any strategic plan regards michelle,00:33:00,No

templemancalectect tana joneshouectect cc dpefblakescom subject alberta ppa financing i thought i might try to sum up it seems to me that we both need to finalize the structure as well as coordinate across various groups such that we all know what each is doing with the view to funding on time by the end of next week one as soon as possible next week ie monday we need to finalize the swap structure including the credit and covenant package two if there is not already a term sheet in place it may be useful to have one prepared frankly it seems from my various discussions with global finance credit origination enron corp royal bank of canada and its external counsel and our external counsel that there are certain agreements documents deliverables and covenants that are being expected by or exchanged between the parties but which are not being communicated among each other and we are therefore working at cross purposes frankly unless and until we know what the structure is to look like what the credit and financial covenants are to look like and what the documentation expectations are it is difficult if not impossible to prepare documentation for example a i had a confusing conversation with the bank as to the form of guarantee they were expecting from enron corp i was trying to require the bank to accept an enron corp standard form guarantee whereas the bank was looking for a long form guarantee that includes the covenants representations and warranties of enron corp in its revolving credit facilities based upon this disagreement i left a message for clement to the effect that we may have a problem to resolve however clement was kind enough to advise me by voice mail that in fact enron corp does not have a problem with giving a long form guarantee of this nature and that the form of guarantee had in fact been provided by whom im not sure to the bank b the bank was enquiring as to what would be the governing law of the enron corp guarantee to which i advised it would be texas law however i now understand there may be some agreement by whom im not sure to have the enron corp guarantee governed by new york law c in any event i understand that the bank will be looking for a form of enforceability opinion from enron corps outside legal counsel with respect to the authorization execution delivery and enforceability of the enron corp guarantee as well as certain conflicts of laws opinions with respect to the governing law of the guarantee texasnew york being enforceable d in my discussions with the bank this afternoon it also became aware to me that the bank is expecting external counsel legal opinions with respect to enron canada blake cassels graydon is prepared to provide those legal opinions e as noted above i have discussed with the bank that the governing law of the underlying swap documents would be alberta to which they seemed fine i suggested that ontario law would also be acceptable f i assume that enron canada ought to obtain legal opinions from the banks external counsel with respect to the documents and obligations of swapco and perhaps even the bank but i will need to have this confirmed g it came to my attention during my conversations with the bank this afternoon that swapco or financing spv is unaffiliated to the bank this presents problems as i understand for accounting purposes the two swaps involving enron canada cannot be linked for example by crossdefaults at the same time unaffiliated exposures under delinked transactions may not be capable of being setoff we undertook to attempt to remedy this situation through broadening the setoff concepts under the isda master agreements h i do not think the bank frankly nor anyone else has a firm grasp on the creditcollateralizationmargin requirements which i think is dependent upon a final understanding of the swap structure i from my discussions with the bank it seemed to me that they were not clear as to how their fees and costs would be repaid through the swap structure although it might be as simple as adding these amounts to the principal amount of the swaps i suggested that the bank prepare a separate fee letter to recover its fees more problematically the bank was not clear as to how increased costs would be accounted for in the swap structure generally speaking a bank credit agreement contains provisions that if there are increased costs of funding to the bank as a result of a change in bank regulations or lending or reserve requirements those increased costs are flowed through they were not sure how this could be accommodated in a swap structure i suggested that there may be some way to fix this through a price adjustment mechanism in the fixed price or volumes or through a separate indemnification in the fee letter j the bank is anxious to see paper and i am not sure who is preparing the paper and consolidating it in a distribution package to the bank for example i think a package that includes all of the swap master agreements and related documentation which i believe mark ts group will prepare in houston the enron corp guarantee which ive indicated above seems to have already been provided in draft to the bank and all other documentation needs to be sent to the bank as soon as possible as well as to blake cassels graydon and vinson and elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the bank in connection with the transaction of course this depends on finalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants package in concept i have told the bank and i believe the bank agrees that the form of the isda master and related documentation would be the same as the form of isda master which currently exists between ena and royal bank of canada and the bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper as soon as possible perhaps tana could look after delivering that as soon as possible if not this afternoon monday morning frankly i think this project if it is to get funded on time needs a measure of coordination and communication of internal and external expectations it may be worthwhile to convene a conference call

big company that did heavy lobbying of the federal government and then went bust costing investors billions and workers their jobs why wendy gramm most recently awakened watchdogs would say wife of the republican phil gramm of texas previous chairman of the banking committee as a director of enron she was on the audit committee that didnt question the fastand loose auditing and subtracting the deferred compensation that went into the tank received about two two zero zero zero zero over eight years thats peanuts say republicans the senatorial wife who hit it big was anne bingaman married to new mexicos jeff bingaman chairman of the energy and natural resources committee as lobbyist for the telecommunications comet global crossing which went bankrupt last month she received two five zero zero zero zero zero for six months work during one nine nine nine both senatorial wives are accomplished executives who parlayed responsible government appointments into lucrative private positions wendy gramm was chairman of the commodity futures trading commission anne bingaman was bill clintons assistant attorney general for antitrust until leaving in june one nine nine six her lobbying fee for delaying approval of a competitors undersea cable still makes beltway bandits gasp this juxtaposition shows that the enron scandal is having only bipartisan political fallout in this case the everybody did it defense works you can bet that neither spouse will be subpoenaed and publicly humiliated by the club member fritz hollings at the commerce committee because both the biggest bankrupt enron and the fourthbiggest bankrupt global crossing made contributions to politicians of both parties the resulting public disgust has been used to advance bipartisan campaign finance reform enron which mostly embarrassed republicans has been wrung dry in the media the sight of the tilted e symbol elicits yawns from viewers its the telecommunications giant global crossings turn in the barrel now well be hearing about clinton connections on its board and its bosss milliondollar contribution to the clinton library especially delicious will be the examination of terry mcauliffe the fabled fundraiser whom bill clinton insisted the democratic national committee take on as chairman mcauliffe says he merely invested one zero zero zero zero zero in global crossing and sold it for one eight million and whats the big deal what his dnc spokesman wont say is what price per share he paid before the company went public and what that stock was worth when it went on the market and what he did to earn the difference same question could be directed to bush the elder but after the politicians tire of wounding each other and declare a truce we may see some overdue action on the control of financial derivatives these are the investments often off the books in futures and currencies that slice and dice risk and have made instant billionaires but whose abuse has been disastrous to investors from orange county to longterm capital management hedge funds are supposed to spread and reduce risk in reality they are often used to make huge bets unknown to their institutional investors accountants are supposed to enforce disclosure of all liabilities but many have become expert in the concealment of risk i dont profess to understand the worries some of my financial sources express about dangerous excesses in the convertible bond market swaptions and evernarrowing derivatives but my unwillingness to break my head learning these intricacies gives the wheelerdealers an edge complication and secrecy are mothers milk to them while the average investors best protection is full disclosure when you flip over a flat rock like enron or global crossing you see much panicky

'cherie.ancrum@enron.com'""]",FW: The Truth,this is long but really caught my attention and felt no other choice but to share with those i care forhave a blessed day finally the truth on national tv billy grahams daughter was being interviewed on the early show and jane clayson asked her how could god let something like this happen and anne graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response she said i believe that god is deeply saddened by this just as we are but for years weve been telling god to get out of our schools to get out of our government and to get out of our lives and being the gentleman that he is i believe that he has calmly backed out how can we expect god to give us his blessing and his protection if we demand that he leave us alone i know theres been a lot of email going around in regards to nine one one zero one but this really makes you think if you dont have time at least skim through it but the bottom line is something to think aboutin light of recent eventsterrorists attack school shootings etc lets see i think it started when madeline murray ohare she was murdered her body was found recently complained she didnt want any prayer in our schools and we said ok then someone said you better not read the bible in school the bible that says thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal and love your neighbor as yourself and we said ok then dr benjamin spock said we shouldnt spank our children when they misbehave because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their selfesteem dr spocks son committed suicide and we said an expert should know what hes talking about so we said ok then someone said teachers and principals better not discipline our children when they misbehave and the school administrators said no faculty member in this school better touch a student when they misbehave because we dont want any bad publicity and we surely dont want to be sued theres big difference between disciplining and touching beating smacking humiliating kicking etc and we said ok then someone said lets let our daughters have abortions if they want and they wont even have to tell their parents and we said ok then some wise school board member said since boys will be boys and theyre going to do it anyway lets give our sons all the condoms they want so they can have all the fun they desire and we wont have to tell their parents they got them at school and we said ok then some of our top elected officials said it doesnt matter what we do in private as long as we do our jobs and agreeing with them we said it doesnt matter to me what anyone including the president does in private as long as i have a job and the economy is good and then someone said lets print magazines with pictures of nude women and call it wholesome downtoearth appreciation for the beauty of the female body and we said ok and then someone else took that appreciation a step further and published pictures of nude children and then stepped further still by making them available on the internet and we said ok theyre entitled to their free speech and then the entertainment industry said lets make tv shows and movies that promote profanity violence and illicit sex and lets record music that encourages rape drugs murder suicide and satanic themes and we said its just entertainment it has no adverse effect and nobody takes it seriously anyway so go right ahead now were asking ourselves why our children have no conscience why they dont know right from wrong and why it doesnt bother them to kill strangers their classmates and themselves probably if we think about it long and hard enough we can figure it out i think it has a great deal to do with we reap what we sow dear god why didnt you save the little girl killed in her classroom sincerely concerned student and the reply dear concerned student i am not allowed in schools sincerely god funny how simple it is for people to trash god and then wonder why the worlds going to hell funny how we believe what the newspapers say but question what the bible says funny how everyone wants to go to heaven provided they do not have to believe think say or do anything the bible says funny how someone can say i believe in god but still follow satan who by the way also believes in god funny how we are quick to judge but not to be judged funny how you can send a thousand jokes through email and they spread like wildfire but when you start sending messages regarding the lord people think twice about sharing funny how the lewd crude vulgar and obscene pass freely through cyberspace but the public discussion of god is suppressed in the school and workplace funny how someone can be so fired up for christ on sunday but be an invisible christian the rest of the week are you laughing funny how when you go to forward this message you will not send it to many on your address list because youre not sure what they believe or what they will think of you for sending it to them funny how i can be more worried about what other people think of me than what god thinks of me are you thinking pass it on if you think it has merit if not then just discard itno one will know that you did but if you discard this thought process then dont sit back and complain about what a bad shape the world is in,14:24:45,No

status report on legislative activity thursday jan two five assembly committee held a hearing on abxone one eight hertzberg the speakers vehicle for allowing dwr to purchase power for the state and to use revenue bonds to payoff utility undercollections and to finance ongoing dwr operating costs we have forwarded by fax the latest version of this bill the assembly committee was only able to discuss three sections of the bill before adjourning until one pm tomorrow chairman wright expects to take the remainder of the afternoon tomorrow to go through the bill line by line and expects to only get part way he anticipates no hearings over the weekend and more hearings to follow monday through wednesday next week thus no vote on the bill is expected for a while in addition all parties including wright expect amendments as a result of ongoing negotiations between the governor speaker the utilities and the generators these would center on the price the generators will bid and how much if anything the utilities will have to absorb of past undercollections there is no indication at the present of when they will show or what those amendments will say initial analysis of the bill raises the following issues most important issue on pages three eight of the bill new provisions are added to ab one eight nine zero section three six eight et al to define how the tra and tcba are to be calculated and what the commission must allow in rates these provisions appear unduly generous to the utilities and may well provoke an immediate end to the rate freeze if enacted here are the main elements of the language three six eight two the legislature finds that it is appropriate to allow the utility to recover the reasonable costs incurred to purchase wholesale energy that means the big under collection from summer two zero zero zero to date three six eight three new definitions of the adjusted tcba and net undercollected amounts are provided which appear to provide for the following way of wrapping up transition cost ratemaking one the tcba is the positive balance as of one two three one zero zero increased by the trust transfer amounts to be recovered in rates for two zero zero one also increased by amounts included in retail rates for prior period costs if any are authorized by the cpuc and also increased by the balances in the generation memo accounts as of one two three one zero zero two the new net uncollected amount that the utilities could collect in rates would be the current tra account as reduced by the above defined balance in the tcba as of one two three one zero zero note edison claims this is the same mechanism that enron proposed to the commission as an alternate to the turn proposal it has similarities to the comments we filed nov nine but our official position is still to support the fromthebegining netting of the two accounts as proposed by turn three there is also language to lock in the cpucs current ratemaking for these accounts so that the turn proposal to net the tra and tcba cannot be implemented four the utilitiesretained generation will be put in rate base at book value except for the nukes which will have their rate base calculated without the application of overcollections in the transition cost balancing account to accelerate depreciation five the cpuc is supposed to establish a dedicated rate component within the existing rates as of one eight zero one to allow recovery of the net undercollection the large tra undercollection as reduced per the above the undercollection is to be amortized over one zero years six the utilities will not have to buy power if their credit rating drops below bbb the remainder of the bill has to do with the mechanism for the dwr to purchase power and to have revenue reduction bonds pay for costs in excess of those recovered in the utilities rates rod wright is seeking a stop lossprovision which will force a rate increase once the dwr has used up all its appropriation and all the bond revenues to buy power this is controversial with the other members we have been asked for a reaction by the committee members and would like a response asap certainly by midday friday this will require balancing the concerns about and early end to the rate freeze with the increased likelihood of payment for power transactions once dwr is funded the prospect of successful participation in more auctions is unclear unless more practical auction terms are used however the auction process is not spelled out in this bill the generators are supporting an early end to the freeze so that they can be paidi am in meetings starting early in the am so i will not be on the one zero three zero call please send comments to scott govenoreither by e mail or by fax his fax is

x three credit concerns regarding authority granted to dwr in abone x to purchase two zero electricity on behalf of the utilitiestwo zero enron responded to the rfp issued by dwr to enter into power contracts with two zero suppliers enron is in active discussions with dwr to establish contract terms with th etwo zero goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible however ambiguities contained in abone x have created significant credit risk two zero concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms we understand that the lionzero one s share of

is mutually agreeable to two zero both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements two zero going forward summary of the source of the credit risk issue ambiguous ratemaking authority the language in abone x is ambiguous as to whether dwr has any authority totwo zero charge california ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power from our two zero analysis of the bill the language in abone x appears to leave intact thetwo zero california puczero one s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in california astwo zero such suppliers have no assurance that the puc will agree to include in rat estwo zero adequate charges to cover dwrzero one s costs of power purchases ambiguous regulatory authority regarding contract zero one prudencezero one eight the language in abone x leaves open the possibility that the california public two zero utilities commission could determine that power purchases made by dwr are two zero zero one imprudentzero one eight on the basis of such a finding the cpuc could then ref use totwo zero allow dwr to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its powertwo zero purchases consequently suppliers have no assurance that the puc will agr eetwo zero to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that two zero dwr has entered into with suppliers two zero ambiguous language regarding the ratemaking mechanism that will be used to two zero recover dwrzero one s costs of power purchases in addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority two zero noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to two zero the specific ratemaking zero one mechanicszero one eight that abone x directs the puc to empl oy totwo zero permit dwr to recover its power purchase costs based on our analysis it i stwo zero extremely difficult to determine how the puc would design the rates to ensu retwo zero dwr recovers its power purchase costs moreover as currently drafted it istwo zero difficult to determine whether abone x would even permit the puc to include in two zero rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover dwrzero one s power purchase two zero costs again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since two zero suppliers have little assurance that dwr will have the ability to recover two zero from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power options to resolve concerns regarding credit risktwo zero we have been working diligently with dwr officials to resolve the credit ri sktwo zero issues we have identified three options amend abone x the amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the two zero puc would accept as zero one prudent and reasonablezero one eight all purchase costs incur red bytwo zero dwr and b the puc is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary totwo zero ensure that dwr fully recovers its costs of power purchases this is the two zero preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political two zero challenges standing in the way of amending abone x see attached filetwo zero entitled zero one amendabone xdoczero one eight clarify the ambiguities in abone x through an order issued by the puc andtwo zero through contract language this is the option that we are currently working with dwr officials totwo zero implement however it is more complicated and could take significantly mo retwo zero time to implement than the legislative fix we have attached electronic two zero copies of the talking points related to the order that the california puc two zero would need to issue under this option see attached file entitledtwo zero zero one cpuctalkingpointsdoczero one eight make use of other instruments designed to address credit risk as indicated in our letter responding to dwrzero one s rfp we are willing to ac cepttwo zero other forms of credit from dwr those options include a letter of credit two zero cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral dwr officials have two zero indicated to us that dwr prefers to pursue the second options that is dwr two zero prefers to clarify the ambiguities in abone x through a puc order and through two zero contract amendments four californiazero one s supplydemand picture heading into summer two zero zero one both the california energy commission and cambridge energy researchtwo zero associates cera a private sector energy think tank have issued reports two zero showing that california faces a severe supplydemand imbalance they diffe rtwo zero only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available al ltwo zero credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the summer two zero of two zero zero one and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts aretwo zero likely two zero cec and cera both forecast that california will be short of supply thistwo zero summer by approximately five zero zero zero mw these numbers are in line with ourtwo zero estimates californiazero one s supply base currently has a six capacity margin welltwo zero below the average one five two zero which is recommended for reliable system operatio ntwo zero in the west since the west relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power two zero than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to thetwo zero unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the west has experienced t otwo zero date in the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess t hetwo zero flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply two zero californiazero one s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to thistwo zero requirement two zero other reasons for reduced supply for the summer of two zero zero one include the early two zero drawdown of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage californias seve retwo zero supplydemand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced two zero number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with thetwo zero utilities cambridge energy research associates asserts that at the curren ttwo zero pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be two zero added to correct the market imbalance until two zero zero three at the earliest cera predicts that california is likely to face approximately two zero hours of two zero rolling black outs this summer the cec paints a considerably moretwo zero optimistic scenario betting that california will bring an additional five zero zero zero two zero mws on line to meet peaking summer demand it is our view that california two zero should view the cecs rosy scenario with considerable skepticism five suggested package of legislative proposals designed to solve california zero one stwo zero electricity crisis this email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution we wil ltwo zero deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing two zero bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals as we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to californiastwo zero crisis must focus on four issues

it takes about six years or longer the governorzero one s executive orders and senator sherzero one s siting reform legi slationtwo zero are steps in the right direction our suggested amendments can

summer this can be accomplished mo sttwo zero effectively and quickly in two ways buydown demand california is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the general fun dtwo zero to finance dwrzero one s power purchases california could likely reduce demand moretwo zero economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ldtwo zero be willing to receive to reduce

demand response in two zero excess of four zero zero mw during certain high cost hours and a demand response for two zero summer two zero zero two onpeak hours that could exceed one zero zero zero mw we further estimate two zero that the market response to this program from all esps could be two to three time stwo zero that amount we recommend that the state of california provide rebatestwo zero

 for EPSA Comments, Due MARCH 30TH",memorandum to regulatory affairs committee power marketers working group from joe hartsoe regulatory affairs committee chair bob reilley power marketers working group chair julie simon vice president of policy mark bennett senior manager of policy erin perrigo manager of policy date march two zero two zero zero one re commission actions to increase supply and decrease consumption in the western united stateskey points for epsa comments due march three zero th as we previously reported on march one four two zero zero one ferc announced certain actions to address the energy problems in california and other areas of the west in an order removing obstacles to increased electric generation and natural gas supply in the western united states and requesting comments on further actions to increase energy supply and decrease energy consumption the following is an overview of the steps the commission proposes to immediately help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure the commission also invited comments on certain proposals this memo includes a list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by march three zero th overview of order the order reflects a thorough review of all of fercs rate and facility certification authorities in the areas of electric energy natural gas hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy supply however the commission noted that its authority is somewhat limited while the commission believes state regulators must assume the lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission as well as demand reduction measures the commission noted that the impact of californias energy shortage on the western interconnection underscores the regional interstate nature of the energy marketplace accordingly it encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for western markets epsa appreciates the commissions effort to exercise the full extent of its authority to help ease the wests energy problems taken together the commissions proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational solutions to the difficult circumstances in the west most importantly the order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment including increased generation transmission and natural gas pipeline facilities the commissions immediate actions which will expire on december three one two zero zero one include requiring the california iso and transmission owners within the wscc to provide ferc with a list of shortterm grid enhancements extending and broadening waivers of operating and efficiency standards and fuel use requirements for qualifying facilities qf providing wholesale power sales from generation used primarily for backup and selfgeneration for businesses with prior notice waivers and marketbased rate authorization allowing wholesale and retail load reduction to be resold at wholesale marketbased rates the commission seeks comment on several other proposals including rolling in new supply interconnection and upgrade costs increasing the rate of return on equity for projects that significantly increase transmission on constrained and new routes in the near term one zero year depreciation for shortterm transmission projects and one five year depreciation for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be in service by november one two zero zero two use of the interconnection authority set forth in fpa otwo one zero d to help alleviate obstacles to electric supply reaching load epsas comments in its conclusion the commission stated that comments should be concise and focused accordingly we suggest that epsas comments focus on the following areas applaud the commissions effort to increase supplies from qfs but encourage it to provide relief from existing contracts by allowing qfs to sell to creditworthy parties we understand that there are ongoing differences of opinion regarding the relative merits of an incremental versus a rolled in approach to interconnection and upgrade costs therefore while we may lack a consensus on the question as a final policy position we believe that the extreme circumstances surrounding the order and the urgent need to move power quickly into the western system make it wise to endorse fercs instant recommendation the commissions proposed actions to create and enhance incentives relating to expanding and improving the transmission infrastructure through higher roes and accelerated depreciation schedules are positive steps the commission normally conditions such premiums on meaningful participation in regional transmission organizations however given the current situation and the immediate impact of any projects that might be entitled to the higher roe epsa could support this proposal constraints on the gas infrastructure have a generally adverse impact on the energy supply system therefore the commissions proposed waivers of blanket certificates and rate incentives to expedite construction projects are favorable developments we will discuss the order and epsas comments during tomorrows regulatory affairspower marketers conference call in addition we have been asked to consider what type of shortterm relief could be included in federal legislation we will discuss this question as well to access the call dial one eight zero zero nine three seven six five six three

quality issues htwo s and htwo o with agave and coming up with an agreement on how much they will be allowed to give us they way it stands now is they cant give us anymore than we were giving

baileyetsenronenron team artesiaetsenronenron subject agave atoka system earl mansoor as communicated earlier i met with ed perry with agave today we looked at the atoka three piping drawings and discussed some possibilities for connecting their one two coming into atoka three our old one two atoka loop to the discharge side of the station we decided to make a quick site visit with the team for possible issues drawing athree aone one one nine shows a capped tee on the one two just downstream of the receiver line tiein we talked about connecting to that tee going underground to the west coming above ground and running south along the fence placing some valves for scrubber installation and turning toward the east for tiein to the existing eight meter run the upstream of the meter run upstream of the existing shutin valve would need to be manifolded to allow flow from the one two or commoning like it is now there is a relief valve existing at the eight meter run inlet it can remain on either high or low pressure service an additional relief valve would be needed for the other stream drawing athree aone one one nine a shows the meter run area the downstream meter run piping would need a tee in place of the nine zero under the meter run flange one side of the tee would go the existing valve to the suction side of the station the other side of the tee would go a new valve and line running to the discharge side of the station that line would go west from the meter run outlet to the fence turn north and follow the fence to a point adjacent to an eight valve on drawing athree aone one five at the eight valve the line shown as eight line from meter runs would be cut and capped the new line would flange to the valve with the valve open gas would flow through the eight crossover to the tiein on the eight atoka lateral we went to the site and all piping can be above ground per terry youngren except the initial take off from the one two tee that would need to stay underground to the fence area to permit vehicle traffic the piping in paragraph two would actually be agaves up to the upstream flange at the new valve at the meter run all the downstream piping would be transwesterns additionally agave has said they would place a scrubber on order and expected a one two one six week delivery measurement and quality issues brought up by terry existing eight meter run is secondary tube so no quality equipment exists it does have an operator on upstream valve for shutin it does have full transmitters differential pressure temperature need additional htwo s monitor for high pressure stream looked at two stream sulphur smart physically too large for building need htwo o monitor for high pressure stream kahn or meeco terry is checking on a new type monitor need two stream danalyzer existing chromatograph is single stream the single could be used at new aid st if it is ever separated to west texas need new one eight sample line with shutin solenoid for eight run need new sample probe regulator for eight run look at a corp they have one that includes a membrane filter in the probe i have some drawings that are put together maybe we could get together monday morning and hopefully explain a little better finally i committed nothing to ed i explained that his next steps would be for agave to contact their marketing person and let them run the project through the proper channels for estimates and evaluations i explained that the scenarios he presented of placing however many mmcf on the discharge side reducing the low pressure existing atoka three suction volume and using horsepower to reduce suction pressure and possibly placing two units on lec one zero service to allow entire duke and yates sulphur plant gas on that line would have to have someones blessing besides mine i also explained that some modeling would probably need to be done to check expected results issues like isolating eight atoka lateral from the one two to allow high pressure receipt to bypass dehy at atoka one and still be compressed by atoka one possible and brought up by terry isolating eight from one two and bypassing atoka one completely brought up by ed perry with enough pressure were noted and i said i would pass them along thanks mike,09:32:45,No

seven el paso released this information via a a press release without any prior approval from ena julie please dont hesitate to fill any holes or unintended innaccuracies the situation is complicated

solely for enron however one outcome of the negotiations has been the suit ip launched against el paso at ferc regarding el pasos nom process i believe ena filed in support of the suit el paso is losing that one and will likely change its nom process sooner rather than later i think its important to have a quick call to develop a clear and consistent message on the ena deal and coordinate what were saying about that deal with the other gas issues on the table im assuming that if theres anything we can do to keep harvey morris and california from mucking up the deal the better i know harvey

paso deal could mute competition to ca fearing an end to pipeline competition in california the states regulators and indicated shippers have called on ferc to summarily reject the three transportation agreements by which enron north america corp has contracted for one two five bcfd of unsubscribed firm capacity on el paso natural gas approval of these agreements would give enron corp parent of transwestern pipeline and enron north america control over all the available transportation capacity to the southern california border warned harvey morris principal attorney for the california public utilities commission cpuc which plans to submit its protest today between the two pipelines he estimated enron will control two three four bcfd of firm capacity from the san juan and permian basins to california for morris enron north americas contracting of the el paso capacity represents a worse threat to the pipelines other shippers than dynegy marketing and trade who has held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires dec three one at least then there was some transwestern competition to the dynegy situation now its enron the owner of transwestern whos stepping into dynegys shoes but whats even worse he told ngi is the revenuesharing provision in the contracts it stipulates that after enron makes three five million off of these contracts it has to share the proceeds with el paso for two five of anything beyond three five million so effectively enron and el paso have become partners in how high they can jack up the transportation rate differential between the california border and the southwest producing basins the two pipeline companies that have for decades competed with each other in carrying southwest supplies to california are now partners we think thats anticompetitive and theres no way ferc should approve it morris said he recalled the basis differential between the san juan basin spot price and the california border shot up by one seven during one nine nine eight the first year during which dynegy controlled the el paso capacity into california this situation could worsen under enron he believes at first blush the el pasoenron contracts do not appear to contain the same anticompetitive features of the el pasodynegy contracts indicated shippers noted but a closer review and analysis reveals the anticompetitive effects of the revenuesharing provision rsp in el pasoenron contracts are not only similar to those of the hotly contested reservationreduction mechanism rrm in the el pasodynegy case but are increaseddue to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing affiliate of el pasos primary interstate pipeline competitor transwestern both the rrm and rsp operate to provide a disincentive for el paso and its competitors to compete against each other or to take any other action that will act to drive down the basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity indicated shippers told ferc in a protest filed on wednesday rpnine seven two eight seven zero four one the group includes producers amoco production burlington resources oil and gas marathon oil and phillips petroleum and two marketers amoco energy trading and phillips gas marketing ferc should reject the tariff filing immediately the commission erred in allowing the el pasodynegy contracts to remain intact for their twoyear term after finding that the contracts were anticompetitive this issue is pending in the dc court of appeals that same error should not be repeated here the producers and marketers said the cpucs attempt to block the enronel paso contracts at the outset is a little bit unusual for the agency morris said but it learned its lesson following dynegy when the dynegy situation first hit we asked for ferc to investigate the matter we thought ferc did a very inadequate job thenthis time around were asking for ferc to summarily reject it its hard for an agency like ours to take such a strong stand right at the beginning but weve learned too much from two years of suffering under the dynegy situation and this is even worse in the event the commission should reject californias request the cpuc has asked that an antihoarding condition be included in the contracts which would require enron to release unused capacity into the shortterm market at a price higher than what its paying el paso for the capacity they must make a little profit morris noted were confident enron cant use the entire one two bcfd of capacityso theres going to be unused capacity the agency also wants ferc to clarify that the primary delivery point for the block ii portion of the capacity five seven nine mmcfd is pgetopock in keeping with the terms of the one nine nine six settlement between el paso and its customers morris said he agreed fully with amoco burlington resources and southern california gas socalgas which accused el paso of violating the one nine nine six agreement by allowing dynegy to use socalgastopock as a primary delivery point for the block ii capacity last summer they contend the alleged violation is included in the enron contracts he also noted the cpuc will challenge the ability of enron to call back block ii capacity after it already had been recalled by el paso shippers to serve pacific gas and electric pge customers in northern california last july ferc granted dynegy the right to do this under its contracts with el paso but morris contends the decision violates the one nine nine six settlement under which pge paid five four million to preserve the right of the pipelines shippers to recall the block ii capacity to serve endusers in its service territory the cpuc also intends to challenge the commissions decision that would enable enron to just sit on the capacity thereby withholding idle block ii capacity from the market indicated shippers also contend the enron contracts violate the block ii capacity provisions of the one nine nine six rate case as well as exacerbate the primary firm delivery point capacityallocation issues that are pending before ferc now the cpuc accused el paso of deliberately filing the enron contracts at ferc just before the holidays to avoid controversy the pipeline is trying to sneak one of the most controversial things ever past ferc right before christmas so that protests would be minimized said morris they did this with the dynegy contracts two years ago they have a pattern of filing right at the last minute making it harder for people to protest and harder for ferc to stop it from going

history below that suggests that t here is a relationship between efs buying the existing projects under the g sa contract and a potential adverse affect on the gsa commodity portion of the commodity risk book this is not the case the potential adverse affe ct on the commodity risk book would exist regardless of whether or not efs bought the projects that is if there were no change to the internal stru cture of the contract and ees went forward as if nothing had happened then the issue of this potential adverse affect would still exist it would ex ist as an internal ees problem which would have to be resolved because we h ave an existing contract with the va this commodity risk issue would not exist only if we were going to terminate all the va projects but as far as i know there has never been serious consideration to terminating the pr ojectsif for no other reason we have no right to unilaterally terminate only the government has that right the important point here is that this issue is not an issue pertinent to th e indemnification issue whatever needs to be done to complete the indemni fication process should proceed uninterrupted once the indemnification ha s been resolved then as a separate matter ees and efs should address what affect the projects have on the commodity book they are separate issues and would have to be resolved independent of any indemnification issue two

california ap via newsedge corporation even with customers paying up to four six percent more for electricity californias financial controller says the state faces a dlrs seven four billion shortfall over the next one eight months if it keeps buying power but a state department of finance spokesman dismissed kathleen connells dire financial projection saying it doesnt take into account the governors efforts to reduce electricity costs by signing longterm purchasing contracts with power wholesalers connell estimated california will spend dlrs two six eight billion buying electricity the next one eight months for the states two largest utilities which are on the brink of bankruptcy despite the rate increase approved this week and the dlrs one two four billion the state is authorized to sell in bonds she said wednesday that california would find itself billions of dollars in debt by october two zero zero two connell said the problem is that gov gray davis and lawmakers failed to examine the states ledgers before buying power for southern california edison and pacific gas and electric co we must all work together so the left hand knows what the right hand is doing you have to look at the books before attempting to solve the energy crisis she said department of finance spokesman sandy harrison said california normally has cash flow problems in october because most of the states revenue comes in april just how much californias energy crisis will cost the state has been hotly debated by state officials financial experts and business people some predict the power crisis and rolling blackouts will have a ripple effect through all segments of the states economy and even into neighboring states remember that trends start in california said jack kyser chief economist for the los angeles economic development corporation i think this is definitely going to create inflationary pressures and that is something the federal reserve bank cant do anything about californias dlrs one three trillion economy accounts for one three percent of the nations gross domestic product and one six percent of us consumer demand the energy crisis has been blamed mainly on californias

2000-06-18,"[""'rebecca.cantrell@enron.com'""]","[""'jane.tholt@enron.com'""]","El Paso ADR Settlement Conference, June 12-13",in the final analysis we did not make a lot of progress in reaching agreement to settle the rpnine nine five zero seven proceeding on el pasos capacity allocation proposal at the conference in san francisco last week the parties have agreed to proceed on a dual track because of burlingtons concerns about timing we will reconvene for settlement discussions july one two and one three at southwest gass offices in las vegas after comments and reply comments are filed as permitted under the procedures agreed to at the may two technical conference at ferc comments are due june three zero and reply comments on july seven amoco and burlington filed the original complaint on september two one one nine nine nine and requested fasttrack processing under the commissions new complaint procedures burlington is pushing to have the commission adhere to the fasttrack processing of the complaint maintaining that an order should have been issued within two four zero days i dont know where they got that from i cant find any such requirement and vehemently opposed any attempts to extend the procedural schedule the tone of the meeting was set when harvey morris representing the cpuc was allowed to make a statement because he had to leave by one three zero the meeting started about one two three zero he started by saying that the cpuc was in complete opposition to the settlement proposal circulated by el paso on june six and then outlined all the reasons it was unfair to california shippers and was in violation of the nine six settlement after harvey spoke el paso then reviewed its june six settlement proposal which you received by email and provided some additional explanations of assumptions etc then the parties met in individual groups to caucus on their positions and reconvened as a group to discuss of particular note was the allocation of the three six zero mmd of san juanonly capacity that el paso proposed to take back from burlington nine seven jfour and amoco nine seven jb el paso said that it had been allocated one zero six mm to the havasu shippers one eight zero mm to the eoc shippers and seven four mm to all others california cd shippers this was a major point of contention in most of the ensuing discussions california shippers objected to eoc getting the lions share of the additional san juan capacity under el pasos proposal eoc shippers would get eight two of their rights from san juan and one eight from permian based on bds cd shippers on the other hand get six one and three nine respectively eoc shippers pointed out that the bds were not actually representative of their load bds were simply a number negotiated among the eoc shippers to allocate the costs that were allocated between eoc and california in the nine six settlement certain eoc shippers suggested that their specified rights should be based on some other calculation such as noncoincident peak day usage rather than bd another major issue was the proposal that full requirements shippers fr shippers be given systemwide receipt point rights in addition to the specified rights they would get based on their billing determinants bd el paso proposed that these systemwide rights would have a scheduling priority superior to that of a cd shipper using its capacity on an alternate firm basis either alternate receiptprimary delivery or alternate receiptalternate delivery of course the fr shippers approved of the proposal but most other parties objected to it several suggestions were advanced to try to reach a compromise for instance limiting fr shippers to primary specified receipt point rights during cycle one nominations but none were accepted most nonfr shippers stated concerns about the practical impact of giving fr shippers such a scheduling priority particularly since el pasos interpretation was that the fr shippers would not have to nominate any of their permian specified rights in order to come back to the san juan with the systemwide rights everyone pretty much agreed that el pasos proposal for capacity release of receipt point rights four in their writeup was a nonstarter it was put on the table to address an earlier suggestion by eoc shippers that if they could be made economically neutral to using nonsan juan points they might be more receptive to some restrictions on their specified rights what they were looking for was some discount for using permian and there was some further discussion along those lines but el paso was not receptive stating that such would mean opening the allocation of costs in the rate case a third issue was who gets what rights at socaltopock socal gas doesnt consider el pasos proposal not to sell block ii turnedback capacity to its topock point to be of much value since ferc has said they cant anyway socal gas is looking for a right to get out of any of its contract for which it cannot get a specified delivery point of socaltopock however socal gas cant at this point commit to the group a number that it could live with as a specified right at topock conversely all the other cd shippers who think they bought firm rights at socaltopock are not willing to see socal gas get all the rights unless they too can get out of their contracts fuel was the other contentious issue that seems to be a key sticking point for certain parties some insist it has to remain in the settlement others say there cant be a settlement if it stays in el pasos proposal would move the fuel rate back to four eight five effective two one zero zero by changing the way they eliminate fuel used in facilities that have been refunctionalized as gathering in the filing to be effective two one zero one the rate would go down to approximately four four and then to three eight eight on one one zero three burlington insists they will opt out of the settlement if they dont get relief on fuel apparently to the extent el paso doesnt include the costs of compressors that burlingtons gas utilizes in systemwide fuel they have to pay a higher fuel rate to el pasos gathering affiliate they say it has already cost them several million dollars i heard numbers between nine and two seven million no hard data and they will not settle without getting something in return after the full group discussion and statements of position on monday afternoon rick miles the ferc adr facilitator pushed for individual meetings between the various segments eoc california producers marketers el paso based on several parties representations that they were willing to continue talking a schedule was worked out and the individual meetings took up the morning on tuesday just before lunch the entire group got back together and accepted mr miles suggestion that each segment select three or four representatives who would then engage in a full discussion of the issues he felt that with a smaller group it might be easier to reach some understandings however it apparently didnt work because he called us all back late in the afternoon for a full group discussion where the positions outlined above were stated and restated certain parties when pressed could not agree to certain basic principles because they said they would have to get input from others in their organization mr miles expressed his frustration that parties were at the table who didnt know what their bottom line position was eg socal gas southwest gas following discussion by the producers particularly burlington as noted above that they would not agree to an extension of the date for filing comments the next settlement meeting was scheduled after the filing dates mr miles requested that parties send him an email note that would state their bottom line settlement position which he would keep confidential he would review all the positions and to the extent possible put then together and float a settlement package of his own he assured all that no one would be able to identify the individual positions from his package one positive note at this meeting was that there was no conflict over the pooling committees report no one registered any complaints although a few parties who had not been at the last settlement conference indicated that they would like to participate this is how i see our bottomline position i would like to send it to rick late this week if everyone agrees a pooling procedure that will follow assigned priority rankings for both market and supply with no restrictions on pooltopool transfers loops allowed only san juan receipt point rights on our havasu contract or preferably termination of the contract so that the san juan rights could be allocated to others as part of a settlement full requirements shippers systemwide rights above their specified point rights would not have a higher priority than cd shippers using alternate delivery points although no objection to using some allocation method other than billing determinants such as peak day volume to establish those specified point rights do you have any opinion about the allocation of socaltopock rights please give me a call when youve had a chance to look this over im sure youll have some questions also well need to talk about what kind of comments we want to

looked like he was carrying all of his books i thought to myself why would anyone bring home all his books on a friday he must really be a nerd i had quite a weekend planned parties and a football game with my friends tomorrow afternoon so i shrugged my shoulders and went on as i was walking i saw a bunch of kids running toward him they ran at him knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt his glasses went flying and i saw them land in the grass about ten feet from him he looked up and i saw this terrible sadness in his eyes my heart went out to him so i jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses and i saw a tear in his eye as i handed him his glasses i said those guys are jerks they really should get lives he looked at me and said hey thanks there was a big smile on his face it was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude i helped him pick up his books and asked him where he lived as it turned out he lived near me so i asked him why i had never seen him before he said he had gone to private school before now i would have never hung out with a private school kid before we talked all the way home and i carried some of his books he turned out to be a pretty cool kid i asked him if he wanted to play a little football with my friends he said yes we hung out all weekend and the more i got to know kyle the more i liked him and my friends thought the same of him monday morning came and there was kyle with the huge stack of books again i stopped him and said boy you are gonna really build some serious muscles with this pile of books everyday he just laughed and handed me half the books over the next four years kyle and i became best friends when we were seniors we began to think about college kyle decided on georgetown and i was going to duke i knew that we would always be friends that the miles would never be a problem he was going to be a doctor and i was going for business on a football scholarship kyle was valedictorian of our class i teased him all the time about being a nerd he had to prepare a speech for graduation i was so glad it wasnt me having to get up there and speak graduation day i saw kyle he looked great he was one of those guys that really found himself during high school he filled out and actually looked good in glasses he had more dates than i had and all the girls loved him boy sometimes i was jealous today was one of those days i could see that he was nervous about his speech so i smacked him on the back and said hey big guy youll be great he looked at me with one of those looks the really grateful one and smiled thanks he said as he started his speech he cleared his throat and began graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years your parents your teachers your siblings maybe a coachbut mostly your friends i am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give them i am going to tell you a story i just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met he had planned to kill himself over the weekend he talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his mom wouldnt have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home he looked hard at me and gave me a little smile thankfully i was saved my friend saved me from doing the unspeakable i heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome popular boy told us all about his weakest moment i saw his mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile not until that moment did

selfinflicted electricity woes los angeles times august two five two zero zero zero return to headlines publication date friday august two five two zero zero zero page cone los angeles times home edition copyright two zero zero zero the times mirror company by james flanigan lets be clear the fact that the state botched the job of deregulation to begin with is one reason californias electricity market is such a mess but failure to build a single new power plant in the state even as californias economy expanded its use of electricity is the basic cause of todays shortages and soaring prices in san diego orange county and other areas still some simple steps can be taken by regulators legislators and gov gray davis to provide immediate relief the states major utilities should be free to buy power wherever they can get it they should not have to buy exclusively from the power exchange the pasadenabased power pool that was set up by the one nine nine eight deregulation to achieve auctionbased prices for roughly eight zero of the states electricity approval should be expedited for adding smaller generating plants that supply power at times of peak demand that could alleviate a tight supplydemand situation over the next year or two while larger plants are built long term the state needs to speed up the approval process for building new electricity plants the state also should force utilities to invest in the stillregulated system of power transmission lines which now has weaknesses in the san diego and san francisco areas perhaps the most glaring fact about californias electricity problem is how few companies have stepped up to supply power to this enormous market the nations biggest only one five or so suppliers including federal agencies the states own utilities municipal companies and private generating firms supply power to californias system by contrast pennsylvania which has an electricity market less than one two the size of californias has one three zero separate suppliers of electricity today reports john quain chairman of that states public utility commission its no coincidence that pennsylvania has seen monthly electric bills drop three on average since deregulation its worked out terrifically quain says what did california do wrong it allowed the states major utilitiespacific gas electric southern california edison and san diego gas electricto recover one zero zero of their unrecovered or stranded costs for nuclear and hydroelectric plants and for past power purchase schemes mandated by the california legislature to encourage alternative sources of energy then californias legislators told the utilities to sell their conventional power plants to private generating companies all of which would sell their power to a central power exchange the california scheme was flawed at once overregulated and yet commercially clueless in not foreseeing trouble from a single power pool fed by only a handful of suppliers how did pennsylvania do it it allowed the states utilities to recover no more than six seven of their stranded costs for nuclear plantsreasoning that company shareholders should accept some of the risk of their investments and rather than set up a central power exchange the state allowed its utilities and newcomers to the states electric system to compete for business competition after all is what deregulation is supposed to encourage and competition is not happening in california it should be noted that the summer is relatively cool in the east this year and extraordinarily hot throughout the west all the western states are suffering electricity problems thats another reason for californias trouble normally two eight of californias electricity comes from us and canadian government systems and from utilities in oregon and washington nevada and arizona but this year because of lower hydroelectric supplies and higher demand from booming economies in those other states power for california is in shorter supply and more expensive when the state can get it now there are accusations that some suppliers to california have taken advantage of their market leverage to extract premium prices for power theres nothing illegal in angling for a better price or in using futures markets and other trading techniques as some generators may have done if any stepped over the line to illegal collusion federal and other investigations will determine the facts but who gave the generators the market leverage to exploit us the california regulators legislators and utilities did told to sell their generating plants in one nine nine eight the utilities sold dozens of plants in package deals of two and three to single buyers they received premium prices from buyers such as aes corp duke energy southern co reliant energy dynegy and nrg the premiums were paid for the market leverage that multiple plants afforded the buyers nobody in the utilities reckoned that they were handing market leverage to potential commercial adversaries nobody in the legislature or the regulatory staffs reckoned that the central power exchange could be held up by market leverage as outsiders often say about californians maybe its the sunshine makes them slow end zero five two three edt august two five two zero zero zero copyright two zero zero zero times

2000-10-24,"[""'gfergus@brobeck.com'""]","[""'richard.b.sanders@enron.com'""]",Some thoughts on options,privileged and confidential attorney client privilege richard after todays discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on options one wait for a better protective order ask harvey morris where they are on fixing the protective order that is being litigated by others if the protective order has not changed then unilaterally postpone production until it is pro better protection and more time con even with a more stringent protective order enron still questions whether the puc is entitled to financial performance data thus this option does not fully disclose all of enrons positions and the company may be accused later of simply engaging in delaying tactics under this option we file our formal objections as well two turn over the transaction data as is continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for electricity that was delivered pro puc will get the data anyway either through ferc unfair competition antitrust or price gouging litigation by turning over the data that will show profits puc might slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by seeking to depose witnesses etc con this would be waiving the legitimate question that enron has as to the pucs ability to discovery this information through a subpoena there is also a question of how confidential this data would be given the current political agenda it might also serve to whet the appetite of the puc for more enron information and discovery this option would also provide confidential proprietary information to the puc about how enron gets its competitive advantage three turn over data for outside of california and let puc get rest of data from iso and px we have told the puc we do not want to duplicate the efforts of iso and px so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give only missing data pro it would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of california data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question con without enron cost data for the california iso and px transactions the puc would not be able to arrive at what they want a profit and loss picture we would have a hard time representing to the puc that the combination of the puc data and the enron data would be all that they need to calculate the answers to request nos seven one zero four turn over everything but price this option would simple omit the price data pro it would not reveal the profit and loss information con it would not reveal the profit and loss information in other words the puc is clear that this is what they are after by giving them everything else we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and loss moreover by piecing some of it together with the iso and px data the puc might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be quite large but just not the cost or expense side five decline to produce the data we would tell harvey morris that enron has reconsidered its position for the following reasons one our firm belief that the puc is not entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking two in his latest email harvey has made it clear that the puc wants more data one nine nine nine than we discussed earlier three continued threat that if they do not like the transaction data they will come back and ask for profit and loss information that we do not believe they are entitled to four commissioner woods statement that the purpose of this investigation is to get money from market participants in the hands of consumers five investigation by the ag into activities of other market participants and the notice that other governmental agencies are cooperating who are we producing this information to and for what purpose six enron favors public disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to do so seven enron is a small player in this market and many other market participants are not involved in the process bpa etc pro this may be the only way to preserve enrons challenge to the jurisdiction of the puc to get this data moreover in the current political environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked it also makes sense to see what ferc will do with their published one one one zero zero report on investigation date under this option we file our formal objections and sit back and wait six me too upon reflection we agree with the approach taken by the other market participants we will not produce until the protective order is modified and then only data that is within the puc jurisdiction pro this makes it look like all the market participants are acting in concert and really is no different than option one above moreover if you read reliants responses they appear ready to turn over financial data if the protective order is modified terry and mike day are both out of their offices today note that williams is adopting a strategy that says the puc needs to go to superior court to enforce its subpoena this may be met with strong opposition by the puc given their california constitutional contempt authority seven move to quash before the alj here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the puc does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits before the alj pro the alj is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions it has the least procedural risks of being dismissed con reading the tea leaves we believe it unlikely that the alj will determine that the puc has no jurisdiction moreover because the puc has its own constitutionally granted contempt power the puc will take the view according to mike day that they need not go to the superior court for enforcement they will also take the view that the superior court has no jurisdiction to hear our appeal appeals have to go to the puc and those orders are appealable at the court of appeal level thus the only de novo review of our objections might be at the alj level eight file declaratory relief action in federal court in california we would claim federal question jurisdiction under the federal power act and in particular the provisions of eight two four g under which the puc issued its subpoena in part the dispute to be decided is whether the puc has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and loss information from the wholesale market the authority for this would be mississippi power light v mississippi four eight seven us three five four bright line between wholesale market regulated by ferc and the retail market regulated by states bristol energy corp v new hampshire one three fthree d four seven one one st cir one nine nine four federal question whether state agency can inquire into business and financial data in the wholesale market but found no cognizable claim pro the federal forum may be more even handed than the alj but the question is whether we can state a cognizable claim there may be greater protections from disclosure of the information as well con the puc may continue on a parallel track unless we are able to obtain injunctive relief the puc might seek discovery of the same information in the federal court proceeding we should assume that this action will trigger the strongest response from the puc andor the ag in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same information eg unfair business practice suit price gouging antitrust etc we should anticipate deposition requests for traders etc by taking this position we will clearly be conceding that if ferc asks for the data it is germane to their authority nine separate responsesstrategies for different enron entities it may make some sense to chart a different course for portland general ees and eemc and continue to produce some data from those entities pro the information provided for these entities is not likely to generate profit and loss information that would be germane to the fight we are about to engage in eg eess description of off tariff rates for example for portland general dave aamodt is out of the office and not able to
