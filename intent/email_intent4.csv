surrounding san diego belectricityb bills is a poignant reminder of just how politicized an issue can become under the rubric of fostering the public good in this case californias sevenyear belectricb industry bderegulationb effort with complete support and crafting from the democraticcontrolled state legislature is being made the whipping boy for the current price spikes the truth is anything but nevertheless facts have never stopped elected officials politically appointed regulators or consumer advocates as they try to elbow one another out of the way to be seen by consumers as their patron saint in the debate over this summers high power bills it is the very folks who are screaming the loudest who have contributed the most to the crisis among the culprits sen steve peace del cajon the legislature public utilities commission member carl wood and san diego gaselectric co each has contributed to the bills going through the roof but having said that it never has been nor does it need to be a crisis for the state or for san diego county california will survive the current electrical bumps and grinds but it may not survive the political fallout it is now clear that two gov gray davis appointees wood and cpuc president loretta lynch want to reregulate the electric industry as does sen peace sdge unfortunately was dumb enough to help establish the climate that has allowed them to demagogue the issue and escalate its importance way out of proportion start with a recent assault by wood to declare that a radical deregulation policy driven by ideology rather than economic soundness has created a crisis the cornerstone of the problem as wood sees it is that there havent been any major power plants built in the state in more than a decade it is also true that when californias electric restructuring law was unanimously passed four years ago there was an oversupply of generation capacity within the state wood wants to turn that around by mandating utilitybuilt power plants wood knows all too well that more than a dozen major generation plants are under construction or in the states lethargic approval process right now if magically they could all be built by next summer california would be awash in electrons they cant but there is the prospect for getting ahead of the curve by the summer of two zero zero three if the state gov davis most specifically does something to accelerate the current siting approval process earlier this month the governor set in motion work to streamline the siting process regulatory intervention some call it reregulation is what peace has had on his mind at least since winter when at an energy discussion held in san diego he sounded the drumbeat for the government to try to correct what he perceives as failings in the market at the same time he and his colleagues in the legislature for the past couple of years have stymied cpuc moves to step up the deregulation process for both natural gas and electricity most notably peace engineered a bipartisan rider in this years budget bill that prevented the states utilities from buying some of their power supplies outside the statecreated power exchange that move and sdges passive financial management helped eliminate one means of lessening the current electric bill shock there are further design flaws in californias restructured electricity market initiated by peace to buffer san diego from having the highest priced power in the state that have complicated the newly developing market and for which politicians take no responsibility finally there is sdge which clings to its own selfproclaimed fiction that it is only an energy delivery service and holds no responsibility for what has happened to the one two million households and businesses using the juice it delivers in fact however the utility company could have taken some steps in the spring in terms of financial riskmanagement instruments offered through the california power exchange that would have lowered the price spike it also could have been more aggressive in promoting conservation by customers subsequently sdge has been tripping all over itself making emergency filings to the cpuc seeking authorizations it could have aggressively pursued before the crisis the regulators granted everything it asked for finally on aug three but sdge does have a generating role it still has a two zero percent interest in the san onofre nuclear plant and a corporate affiliate operates a new power plant in nevada and guess where that plant sold all of its power during the recent crunch in

against the prior version is not particularly helpful but i am happy to provide one if you wish please note that i am the only one on the enron working group that has seen this revised draft it therefore remains subject to comments by the other members of the team instead of providing a redline i thought it would be helpful to review the most substantive changes in this email please feel free to give me a call with any comments or questions one as i have discussed with stephen you should not assume that we have rejected any of your comments if they did not appear in the attached version please contact me to discuss or resend any comments that you believe that we accepted but that are not reflected in this document two several new defined terms have been added several definitions were revised to reflect that espeed will be posting prices to a platform operated by a separate legal entity that espeed will not necessarily control three the defined terms sponsor material adverse effect sponsor regulatory event and sponsor technological failure have been renamed espeed instead of sponsor four sections three a and b have been slightly reworded to reflect the multiple platform concept section three c was moved from section five the standards for a partys right to suspend have been revised slightly also section four d includes a right by enron to suspend prices specifically in the event of mapping errors this provision also relates to the termination right in section one three with respect to mapping errors five section four has been rewritten to reflect the multiple platforms six section five b has been revised to reflect that the parties should develop a set of ground rules for operating and maintaining the interfaces that will govern the parties once they commence operations seven section six has not been changed in any significant manner except for section six d with respect to commissions eight section seven has been moved it was previously section nine and reflects our concerns that the means by which contracts are entered into with enron are clearly disclosed to participants nine the parity section has been revised as we discussed essentially enron shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure parity one zero the reps and warranties and covenants have not been substantively revised but separate reps warranties and covenants are made by each party instead of including both parties repswarrantiescovenants in the same provision one one section one two is new we felt that the agreement did not clearly set forth what would have to be done before the parties could start posting prices one two we have revised section one three ai and iii and one three bi and iii termination events as we discussed one three aii and bii are new one three section one four has been substantially revised but is still confusing however the idea is that the agreement include a single provision governing confidentiality and that certain information that enron is particularly sensitive about will be kept confidential while other information becomes espeeds property at some point to do with as it wishes any thoughts about clarifying section one four would be appreciated one four the indemnity has been revised to include a separate section for each party a and b but we do not believe that the substance of the prior provision was changed one five we need to give further thought to section one six and the provisions that espeed provided to us sections one five e f and g in the prior draft while i have discussed this with stephen and do not object to the point that those provisions is trying to make the language is a bit broad in places and we need to spend more time with it to make sure that it does not conflict with other provisions of the agreement one six i have tried to reserve the right for the parties to obtain injunctive relief but this section needs expansion and i think stephen had some specific thoughts about what would not be subject to arbitration one seven the enron covenant added as exhibit h is not perfect but it is essentially what we had contemplated providing the schedule a listing specified products is also attached therefore the only exhibit or schedule missing is exhibit i which is the commission structure please feel free to call or send a message if you have any

note is to keep you abreast of progress in determining the ga needs for india and seek your opinion for the best reply for wade i look forward for your comments and advise best regards ai here are the salient features meeting with wade the meeting with wade indicated that he is open to suggestions to what needs to be done on the regulatory front he indicated that if ga sees and agrees he would be happy to financeon a semi full time basissuch support from houston his major concern is to satisfy himself that a all what needs to be done on the ga front is being done b manage and maintain an effective team ie those currently employed in bombay and delhi offices just in case of need he mentioned that he is not going to be penny wise and pound foolish given the eight five zero million at stake i informed him that houston shall advise on the best approach as soon as taking stock is complete and generally speaking shall also deliver on what is needed ga needs in india the regulatorygovernment affairs needs in india are in the following five areas a third party sales basically for phase ii output b dealing with the regulatory commission c dealing with mseb the customer e government of india and f ebs the volume and intensity of work however shall differ with the following scenarios namely a enrondpc intends to exit through arbitration b enrondpc intends to renegotiate the contract and c undetermined as of yet here is an assessment of this work load under the two former scenarios arbitration renegotiation third party sales basically for phase ii output lowmedium high dealing with the regulatory commission medium high dealing with mseb the customer medium high government of india and high high ebs medium medium it is surprising to mention that most colleagues here say that enrondpc seems to be taking the arbitration route although that renegotiation in the sense of renegotiate stabilize then take hit on equity and exit is the best way it is more surprising however that no one can speak with any degree of certainty on where the ship is going in this context a riskaverse person shall take the undetermined scenario as equal to renegotiation while a risktaker shall take the undetermined as equal to arbitration personal it is clear that the current personal here shall need support from houston in the renegotiation scenario on a semi full time basis short of that a visit every six weeks may be adequate as the current team here will be working under legalcommercial suggested approach continue understanding the details of the outstanding regulatory tasks for the coming three to four days if the above opinion is still the same then the suggested communication to wade preferably from you is if there is renegotiation then ga shall send the required personpersons on a semifull time basis if arbitration then ga shall be available on as needed basis caveat it is not clear what does rmcdonald wants to see on the ground to tilt the suggested approach above one way or another forwarded by amr ibrahimenron_development on zero six one five two zero zero one zero five five seven am amr ibrahim zero six one two two zero zero one zero six five four am to richard shapironaenronenron cc james d steffesnaenronenron subject india progress report one rick this is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations and short talks with the various colleagues in india team i do have a meeting with wade tomorrow june one three th to understand his requests of support from ga while i do not expect much i shall communicate to wade the standing policy of ga namely ga shall provide the required support notwithstanding this mandate i shall communicate it in a manner to give houston the final say in the context of regulatory support there two important areas for ga contribution they are a dealing with the regulatory commission merc and b third party sales it is likely that india shall need a week per month most conducted from houston but may include a visit to bombay the feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the ppa and exit india but see point five below it is the understanding that there are teams in london that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation to transfer them to mseb as per the contract mseb has to agree on the valuation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process it is noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market basis but rather on accounting basis as most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely route around six zero renegotiation is not discussed much hastily added however renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated in singapore the other day in the lenders meeting they also want enron to complete phase ii which we are refusing if renegotiation is to take place its crux will be the reduction in energy and capacity costs to both phases and finding offtaker to phase ii one four zero zero mw kit and caboodle ntpc or ptc are the likely parties to assume such responsibility of course we are trying to avoid any commercial risks associated with marketing this power whether we accept it or not every issue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and solved the decision making process here is entirely dependent on houston highest level that is directly from rmcdonald and js the fact that both of them did not visit india and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned as a minus point perhaps this point should be communicated to them as mentioned above ga contribution could be in two areas namely dealing the regulatory commission merc and third party sales starting with the later third party sales it is perhaps the most important point in the renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment incidentally enrons commitment in the project is between zero six five and zero eight two five billionwith bdepending on what to include and exclude ironing the issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of renegotiation but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added as for dealing with merc it an ongoing basis particularly that merc is seeking to expand its jurisdiction in favor mseb at every through of the dice i shall keep you posted with progress meanwhile please let me know if you have any questions andor advise best regards ai,23:20:00,No

one five pm et url httpwwwthestreetcomtechinternetone zero six two one seven four html poor commerce one cmrcnasdaq despite its best efforts including wednesdays two one gain its still less than half the stock it used to be trading at about six three a share its well off its splitadjusted high of one six five five zero reached near the end of last year meanwhile archrival ariba arba nasdaq at about one five zero a share has steadily been marching back toward its alltime high of one eight three three one it has jumped four seven since reporting its earnings on july one two but as wednesdays move may indicate it may be commerce ones turn people are beginning to pay attention to the strength of its partnership with germanys sap sapnyse adr an exchange that commerce one is helping build for the big automakers is about to crank up and perhaps more importantly some observers are beginning to see some value in commerce ones focus on socalled direct btwo b which involves buying and selling major supplies like steel for cars instead of office supplies issues aplenty of course there are still plenty of issues facing commerce one the same issues that have held its stock down for instance it carries the stigma of being a concept stock because no one knows whether those same big industry exchanges actually will work its sluggish stock also puts it at a disadvantage to chief competitor ariba when it comes to making acquisitions to grow but for now there are signs that sentiment is shifting in commerce ones favor gavin mlinar an analyst at sands brothers sees three shortterm positives for commerce one hes the analyst who had the gall to downgrade ariba on valuation concerns his firm hasnt done underwriting for either company mlinar says the word on wall street is that commerce one along with its new best friend sap will announce two new online exchanges in the coming weeks tscs adam lashinsky recently wrote a column about the partnership between commerce one and sap while those sorts of announcements no longer guarantee a moon shot for a companys stock they could show that the partnership is working two weeks ago they announced new exchanges in the mining and energy industries commerce one declined to comment about the possible exchanges blastoff on top of that covisint the megaexchange that commerce one is helping build for the auto industry is slated to begin operations at the end of september which could give the first indication of whether these exchanges actually work then theres the coming completion of commerce ones acquisition of consulting firm appnet apntnasdaq investors initially reacted negatively to that deal but since then its become clear that there arent enough consultants in btwo b to go around so the deal will give commerce one its own army of geeks to plug in its software theres no doubt that investors are in a good position with either commerce one or ariba mlinar says but its a matter now of who has the nearterm operational catalysts i think there its commerce one beyond those shortterm catalysts others say commerce one has been positioning itself smartly for the long term especially with its focus on the direct business we think the big play here is in direct says john biestman director of investor relations for commerce one while we will continue to service the indirect procurement side we are hitting at the heart of where we think btwo b will be which is direct goods we want to be the bestofbreed player there ariba has also made headway there but its focus has primarily been on the indirect business in part because its easier to get companies to buy things like paper and pencils online than material that actually goes into the manufacturing process but with companies becoming more comfortable about buying and selling online theyre now looking to the direct business as a way to save more money with big customers like gm gmnyse and boeing ba nyse and its partnership with sap commerce one could be ready to exploit this growing comfort direct vs indirect whats happening is the marketplace is beginning to understand the difference between direct and indirect says ben smith a consultant for at kearney his firm hasnt done consulting for commerce one picking a software solution for one doesnt necessarily include the other smith points back to commerce ones partnership with sap for years the german software maker has been concentrating on the complex kind of software that helps businesses build things if a firm can successfully plug that in to software designed to buy the building blocks like commerce ones software it could have a winning combination the sap partnership legitimizes commerce one in the direct materials space smith says it gives them much more depth from the product standpoint than they can possibly build on their own of course ariba isnt letting this business just slide by its working with partners itwo technologies itwonasdaq and ibmibmnasdaq but this is commerce ones focus so if companies do begin to use direct btwo b commerce one will be ready and waiting,11:06:00,No

seven pm peggy hedstrom zero seven two zero two zero zero zero one zero four nine am to sally beckhouectect cc subject re financial confirm npsix zero five zero one thanks for your prompt response i really hope that you can convince mark taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to calgary is the right thing to do as you recall we have been down the road of improving the service to calgary previously this seems to work in the short term but as soon as there is turnover in the group which unfortunately seems to occurs regularly the service level starts to drop i would like you to consider the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to calgary when you meet with mark first when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial confirmations to calgary mark taylors concern was our legal staff at that time we had one attorney who did not have expertise in the financial area we now have three very competent attorneys greg johnston has spent time in houston and has recently attended an isda training course second there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by houston and with the process itself at the time of the project doorstep audit we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent out after we had approved them as you saw from my memo confirmations are periodically sent out without our review also we have found mistakes in the confirmations themselves including the contract date referred to in the confirmation the first two issues cause me a lot of concern some of the confirmations sent out without our review were wrong which is a big problem we had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out which is even a bigger problem third there is no real additional control in the process by having houston generate the confirmations if you think about what the process is the transactions are done in calgary we fax the deal sheets to houston the confirmation is generated using a template that has been preapproved by legal we review and approve the confirmation and execute them online if done by enron canada corp or send an email if the enron entity is enron north america houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty if the counterparty is a trading company houston follows up on the status of execution for all other entities the calgary office is now doing the followup all these transactions are currently settled out of the calgary office if the transactions were done in calgary we would be using the same preapproved templates that houston is using it is not clear to me where there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in houston or conversely why there is any additional risk in having calgary prepare our own financial confirmations if there is some perception that an element of risk exists by having calgary prepare the financial confirmations why are we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations fourth there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in houston while the review process is done in calgary currently houston has staff handling the calgary transactions because the confirmations are reviewed and approved here i have similar staff who print the confirmations route them for review update tagg notify houston when the review is complete and then followup with either houston or the counterparty on issues or execution we are currently following up on all nontrading company financial confirmations so we are both printing and reviewing the transactions following up with the counterparties and filing these documents as i stated before calgary could assume full responsibility for the financial confirmations without adding any staff fifth there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in houston because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth the confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within two four hours of the transaction being done we feel this time line could be met if we did the financial confirmations here this reduces risk for enron finally because we are a small office i need the opportunity to develop my existing employees so that they dont feel that they need to leave the company in order to broaden their knowledge base given the skill sets of the documentation group it is difficult for them to move into other areas such as risk logistics or accounting so it is important that i am able to keep them challenged within the documentation group because we review the confirmations the basic understanding of the financial transactions already exists however i know that my employees would appreciate having full accountability and responsibility for this function and have the opportunity to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations as a final note i report to you i am fully accountable to you for ensuring that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function properly it would mean a lot to me as well as the documentation staff to get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this function to calgary mark taylor has never met me or my staff yet i get the impression that he doesnt think we are capable of handling this function i hope that you will be able to set him straight on this he just needs to look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that exists here if you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in this memo please let me know as you can see the calgary office feels very strongly about this issue including rob milthorp and peter keohane please let me know how your meeting with mark

friday two one julzero zero to inspect the combustion turbine during that inspection westinghouse employees informed him that the generator had salt water damage at the port as a result the following monday two four julzero zero he visited the port of houston with the siemenswestinghouse insurance adjustor and saw the damaged generator note this was just a cursory visit to verify that in fact the

generator ddp per incoterms one nine nine zero means delivered duty paid westinghouse despite two prior requests from enron has not provided copies of the customs clearance documentation ie we dont know the exact date that the generator cleared customs or if it cleared customs title means ownership but does not imply either risk of loss or care custody and control with title comes both ownership and the responsibility for payment of taxes d info not known by enron when did ship come into port when did damage to generator occur when or if us customs duties were paid f info known by enron generator is a total loss as determined by westinghouse per section one zero two three of contract enron was not given the formal opportunity to inspect the damaged generator until a month after it arrived in port as recalled by matt tezyk westinghouse was then advised by enron in writing that the generator was rejected and that delivery had not occurred authors note matt to find cc of that letter g enrons assertions are that ddp was not satisfied ie delivery of the generator did not occur in accordance with the terms of the contract title ie ownership remains with siemenswestinghouse risk of loss remains with siemenswestinghouse xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx john plz assess the copy of the contract provided to you this afternoon under separate cover we request a legal opinion as to whether delivery in accordance with the contract of the ctunit occurred or not plz call with any questions regards scott,10:36:00,No

earnings per diluted share of zero four three this marks a two six percent increase over the third quarter of last year which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines in addition we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of zero four five for the fourth quarter one eight zero for two zero zero one and two one five for two zero zero two we made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about enrons business strategy and performance so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter over the past few months we have met with analysts to discuss enrons performance we received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units in response to that feedback we have provided results separately for several of our business units for example while we have provided volume figures for north america and europe this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for enron americas and for europe and other commodities in addition information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for wholesale services this quarter they are reported separately finally even though our broadband business is now part of enron wholesale services we are continuing to report that business separately following are the highlights of our businesses wholesale services total income before interest minority interests and taxes ibit increased two eight to seven five four million in the third quarter total wholesale physical volumes increased six five to eight eight two trillion british thermal units equivalent per day tbtued americas ibit increased three one to seven zero one million natural gas volumes increased six to two six seven tbtud and power volumes increased seven seven to two nine zero million megawatt hours mwh europe and other commodity markets ibit remained unchanged at five three million as compared to last year while physical gas and power volumes increased low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat retail services enron energy services reported ibit of seven one million compared to two seven million a year ago so far this year ees has completed more than five zero transactions with large customers and more than nine five zero zero zero deals with small business customers transportation and distribution natural gas pipelines ibit increased slightly to eight five million in the third quarter portland general we reported an ibit loss of one seven million this quarter compared to ibit of seven four million a year ago this loss is due to power contracts pge entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter last week we announced an agreement to sell pge to northwest natural this transaction is expected to close next year global assets this segment includes elektro dabhol tgs azurix and enron wind third quarter ibit remained unchanged at one nine million compared to last year broadband services ibit losses were eight zero million in the current quarter compared to a two zero million loss last year this quarters results include significantly lower investmentrelated income and lower operating costs corporate and other this segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions this segment reported an ibit loss of five nine million compared to one zero six million a year ago in addition this quarter we announced onetime charges of one zero one billion over the past few quarters we have conducted a thorough review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core businesses these charges include a two eight seven million writedown of azurix corp one eight three million associated with the restructuring of broadband services this includes severance costs a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers and a writedown of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers five four four million related to losses from certain investments primarily enrons interest in the new power company broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement with our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things one we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses two we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses and three we expanded our

no tv brown says tech dangerous foe the longhorns game next week at kansas has been set for one pm with no television this is the second faraway game this year that has not been televised the other one was at colorado folks one of the primary reasons that was given for the longhorns playing louisianalafayette with that ridiculous one one am kickoff back in early september when it was hot as blazes was that the tv brass appreciated texas making an extra effort and would reciprocate down the line well it hasnt happened the bayloram game was shown in place of the texascolorado game back on

conflict with the abc college telecasts coach mack brown said monday the longhorns are in for a terrific battle in lubbock saturday night he said the raiders run a nohuddle offense they might get nine zero plays wed better have a bunch of guys ready to rush the passer he said the raiders throw on nearly every down and he said the ut coaches will play a lot of people on defense to try to keep fresh pass rushers in the game he also said the last three games of the season against texas tech and kansas on the road and texas am in austin are all tough games i told the players we could end up six five or we could end up nine two he said i really dont know brown said the longhorns are five five in their last one zero trips to lubbock he is zero one in his one trip to lubbock with the longhorns because the raiders took a four two three five victory in one nine nine eight the last time the horns came to town but brown is one one against the raiders because texas mauled tech last year in austin five eight seven mike leach the tech coach was offensive coordinator at ou last year and brown said texas tech runs the same offensive scheme that oklahoma runs that should get our attention he said raider qb kliff kingsbury is one of the top quarterbacks in the league and in the nation he is much improved it will be strength vs strength when kingsbury the most prolific passer in division i

blackouts.,pge could face mutiny on outages smud others may balk if utility orders summer blackouts by carrie peyton bee staff writer published march seven two zero zero one sacramentos electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on pges command so do a lot of other utilities theyve been writing letters lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with pacific gas and electric co to get off the hook before summer who dodges the blackout bullet is going to play out as a political hot button around the state said george fraser head of the northern california power agency a coalition of municipal utilities in sacramento the next volley is expected soon with the sacramento municipal utility district reportedly poised to notify pge that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utilitys command we are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the sacramento area said linda davis one of seven elected members of the smud board of directors saying they dont want to be dragged down by somebody elses problems two southern california utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by pges or southern california edisons financial woes but in pges view california is in an energy crisis and were all in this together said spokesman john nelson the maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer although gov gray davis has said conservation new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts officials at the independent system operator which runs much of californias grid expect frequent rotating outages one consulting firm cambridge energy research associates predicts two zero hours of rolling blackouts during july and august and about two zero zero hours of especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks before blackouts hit the jockeying over just whose lights air conditioners and assembly lines will be shut down is growing the outcome could affect millions of people statewide the state public utilities commission is probing rolling blackout programs run by the forprofit utilities it regulates including pge and edison a puc analysis has suggested that pges program which currently exempts about four zero percent of its customers should spread the burden more broadly for example it said one nine million homes and businesses are spared just because they share a circuit with a customer deemed essential but notforprofit utilities such as smud which answer to their own elected boards or city councils have other worries many have already lined up their power supplies for summer some have raised rates or are considering raising rates some have taken extra conservation steps they think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease blackout clauses in their contracts with pge smud general manager jan schori is going to use every avenue any avenue to put pressure on including lobbying the iso the governor and others said utility director davis the northern california power agency a jointpowers authority that owns and operates power plants for municipal utilities has begun informal negotiations with pge to change blackout rules according to fraser its top executive it is preparing to write pge asking that its members be exempted from outages altogether failing that it wants them to face fewer outages or to be compensated for cutting off power he said at smud the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what it is required to do during electric emergencies under terms of the interconnection contract that links smuds lines to pges the contracts are being inspected with a finetooth comb said smud director howard posner schori declined to comment on any specifics sources indicated that the main option being considered is notifying pge that because of changed circumstances smud believes it no longer is required to routinely comply with outage requests other options being explored include renegotiating existing agreements with pge posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in january constituents have been asking him why are we participating when were not the problem and i dont have a good answer to that several directors said smud has already spent a lot of money and is considering one six percent rate increases to ensure that it has enough electricity under contract to meet its customers summer demands they believe pge should do the same were almost like a david against goliath here said board vice president genevieve shiroma the huge investorowned utilities next door have severe problems that they need to get under control in addition smud plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its peak corps program which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer households it has already done its part without rotating outages director davis said pge believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities ties to its transmission lines have benefits and burdens to both sides said nelson it wouldnt be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract he said interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to help each other out to avert greater emergencies sometimes reducing demand called load shedding can be the only way to stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or transmission line fails its been around in the electrical fabric forever said jim pope head of silicon valley power santa claras cityrun utility in addition to legal requirements you have a moral obligation so you dont bring the system to collapse like other cityrun utilities silicon valley power has a contract with pge that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency but its contract allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand so no one has to be completely shut off such agreements formed long before deregulation when pge ran the north states grid now are complicated by the one nine nine seven creation of the state independent system operator the iso today runs pieces of the grid owned by pge edison and san diego gas electric co if it believes power use is about to surge past supply potentially triggering a grid collapse across the western united states the iso notifies the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts the big utilities meet that requirement two ways they cut circuits to some of their own customers and they tell smaller connected utilities to cut a proportionate share in northern california about eight zero percent of the outages are borne by pge customers and the rest by customers of smud and other municipal utilities and irrigation districts in one sense we are all in this together if smud were in danger of going down we would hope others would help us out said smuds posner but thats if were in danger from circumstances beyond our control not from mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal it is unclear what penalties if any a utility would face for violating an interconnection agreement in the long run the issue would be fought either in the courts or before the federal energy regulatory commission grid officials said as a practical matter in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest if one utility refused to shed load the iso would probably solve to problem by calling on pge edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks they said,06:44:00,No

Update 7/30/01 - Direct Access,executive summary direct access could make a rescue of socal edison more difficult bond issuances for california may be in jeopardy as direct access becomes more popular with municipalities municipal power is politically attractive there is growing pressure across california for cities to consider forming their own municipal power companies community leaders across the state are enviously eyeing the success of sacramentos smud utility and the los angeles municipal power utility where rate hikes and service disruptions have been far less pronounced than the rest of the state several leaders in san francisco are considering setting up their own power company and another two dozen cities are also contemplating action municipal power companies are not subject to regulation by the california public utilities commission and could therefore sidestep the current proposed structure of rate hikes trying to stop municipalities from opting out of the state power plans will be extremely difficult as it runs against some of the most entrenched and longstanding privileges in california politics under california law it is very difficult to stop many cities from doing what they feel is in their best interest most older and larger cities are charter cities rather than general law cities subject to the california municipal code under the california constitution charter cities can pretty much do anything or provide any service short of printing money and raising an army the league of california cities a weighty organization representing every one of californias cities is already swinging into action to support direct access most assembly democrats started out as city councilors and have some sympathy with local independence and the resistance within the assembly is already building against hertzbergs attempts to stop even large companies getting direct access some city leaders will not wish to fight the governor and the state legislature on the issue but if municipalities do not opt out they may have to explain to their local business and voters why they are paying far more for electricity than a city next door which chooses to set up its own power company cities are beginning to realize they might potentially lose major employers politicians are also beginning to realize that local companies stand to gain or lose a fortune on this matter and this could affect campaign contributions state power plans at risk if municipalities do move to set up their own power companies it could undermine at least three key elements of the state of californias power plans first the rate hike already approved falls mostly on businesses and other large users but municipal power would unpick this structure allow large regions of california to ignore the puc leaving the rate structure to be determined city by city many municipalities may be unable to resist pressure from local businesses to protect them from disproportionate rate hikes others might cave into irate voters second the plans laid out by governor davis and state treasurer angelides for a california state public power authority would also be badly damaged if large regions avoid having anything to do with it it is possible that longterm power contracts might also face an additional hurdle if municipalities opt out of higher longterm rates by buying on the open market it could mean the state is left with excess power that it would have to sell at a loss third revenues to back the proposed power bond could be imperiled if municipalities opt out of the rate structure and revenue stream needed to repay the bond and if the momentum for direct access develops among the cities and municipalities across the state it could make it much more difficult to launch the bond in the first place as investors may take fright at potential threats to the viability of repayments the issue is at an early stage the puc had a general workshop on the matter at its offices in san francisco on friday state legislative leaders are likely to use every political and legal means available to stop municipal secession or at least smother the issue until the power bond is successfully away but stopping the municipalities if they choose to follow this path could prove to be difficult,04:01:00,"Yes,[{'sender': 'kristin.walsh@enron.com', 'receiver': 'louise.kitchen@enron.com', 'subject': 'Cal.

five three four two three zero six zero zero dont ever dial area code eight zero nine this one is being distributed all over the us this is pretty scary especially given the way they try to get you to call be sure you read this pass it on to all your friends family so they dont get scammed this scam has also been identified by the national fraud information center and is costing victims a lot of money there are lots of different permutations of this scam but heres how it works you will receive a message on your answering machine or your pager which asks you to call a number beginning with area code eight zero nine the reason youre asked to call varies it can be to receive information about a family member who has been ill to tell you someone has been arrested died to let you know you have won a wonderful prize etc in each case you are told to call the eight zero nine number right away since there are so many new area codes these days people unknowingly return these calls if you call from the us you will apparently be charged two four two five perminute or youll get a long recorded message the point is they will try to keep you on the phone as long as possible to increase the charges unfortunately when you get your phone bill youll often be charged more than two four one zero zero zero zero why it works the eight zero nine area code is located in the british virgin islands the eight zero nine area code can be used as a paypercall number similar to nine zero zero numbers in the us since eight zero nine is not in the us it is not covered by us regulations of nine zero zero numbers which require that you be notified and warned of charges and rates involved when you call a paypercall number there is also no requirement that the company provide a time period during which you may terminate the call without being charged further whereas many us phones have nine zero zero number blocking to avoid these kinds of charges nine zero zero number blocking will not prevent calls to the eight zero nine area code we recommend that no matter how you get the message if you are asked to call a number with an eight zero nine area code that you dont recognize investigate further andor disregard the message be wary of email or calls asking you to call an eight zero nine area code number its important to prevent becoming a victim of this scam since trying to fight the charges afterwards can become a real nightmare thats because you did actually make the call if you complain both your local phone company and your long distance carrier will not want to get involved and will most likely tell you that they are simply providing the billing for the foreign company youll end up dealing with a foreign company that argues they have done nothing wrong please forward this entire message to your friends family and colleagues to help them become aware of this scam so they dont get ripped off love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired

holiday of the sacrifice and istanbuls streets are full of folks in their holiday best and blood for days cows lambs goats rams and other big animals have been being brought to istanbul from the countryside i read that in cairo you could see people bringing their animals in by cab tent cites consisting of rickety structures of unlumbered wood and huge plastic tarps full of these doomed animals have sprung up under bridges in garbage filled lots and along the highways the citys normal perfume of car exhaust and coal fumes is now mixed with the heavy smells of the barnyard and today the slaughter began pools of blood and rain spotted the pavement in front of my building evidence of a recent butchering on a muddy hillside in one of the older neighborhoods south of the halic golden horn in eski old istanbul i saw several women all smiling surrounding a man vigorously chopping away at the rib cage of a cow with an ax the cows recently skinned hide was spread out neatly beside them the rest of the animal in a heap nearby i passed three men loading sagging plastic sacks no doubt full of the spoils of a recent kill into the trunk of a car sorry but my weak imagination couldnt help but conjure up to images from scorceses goodfellas by a mosque three was a lone rams head under a tree its snout was pointing upwards as if thinking about stretching a neck that was no longer there to the leaves just above it on the sidewalk in front of a butcher shop a man hacking off the skin of a decapitated lamb rolled the body back and forth like a water balloon a few meters away a pen full of sheep ate their feed contentedly from a trough i looked closely at them was surprised to see that they seemed oblivious to the significance of what was going on right next to them mounds of entrails lay in the gutter of one street i walked bye the opening of a narrow alley from which i was assaulted by a draft bloated with the now unpleasant order of fresh meat later i watched with absolutely no idea what it meant a young man put his fingers into the blood runoff of one butchering then walk to his car and wipe it on the license plate the kurban bayram is an extremely important holiday for moslems second only ramadon ramazon in turkish its the time for the hajj hac in turkish or pilgrimage to mecca which all moslems of any means are to make at least once in their lifetimes here in turkey most folks get at least two days off work some the entire week during the holiday throughout the moslem world many families buy an entire animal for sacrifice using only a part of it themselves giving the bulk of it to others including most importantly the poor some play amateur butcher but i have been told the vast majority of them have an expert do it indeed the koran demands that the sacrifice be as quick and painless as possible the holiday itself celebrates the old testament story in which ibrahim abraham to nonmoslems was ordered by god to sacrifice his son abraham reluctantly agreed but was given a last minute reprieve and was allowed to sacrifice a ram instead it is a powerful story about belief and faith and must give animal rightists a few textual problems i can see why moslems have picked the story out as paramount it certainly provides an interesting contrast to the new testament story of gods sacrifice of his son as i walked around istanbul today i overwhelmed the city was a slaughterhouse full of for me somewhat gruesome contrasts young girls in flowered dresses and boys in tiny threepiece suits ran around the streets laughing and playing games with blood on their shoes i passed a curious boy kicking at some unfortunate creatures stomach which had been left on a pile of garbage i saw a little girl holding her mothers hand smiling at me shyly as her mom picked through a pile of discarded intestines april five one nine nine nine my discontent at the sights of the kurban i concluded later was a bit sanctimonious americans eat considerable more meat than turks its only that in the united states the dismemberment is done quite a bit more discretely but why should it be isnt it a better or at least a lot more honest to understand what the animal part and animal youre eating looked like when it was still alive including rippling muscles forlorn gaze and all i thought of my canoe trips to canada and how much more meaningful my fish dinner was because i had caught and cleaned the unlucky critter myself a sharpening of reality i think is always a good thing especially in this time when so much of our knowledge and experience comes secondhand through the media including i have to reluctantly admit my beloved books if our rituals often the most powerful means of creating realityblindness can be infused with as much truth as possible all the better id say then perhaps when those flimsy dreams we try to kid ourselves with disintegrate like pieces of wet toilet paper today is the fivemonth anniversary of my arrival here in istanbul its an amazing thing ive done for myself i think i am as close to totally engaged in my life and the world around me as i have ever been it will be hard to live any other way again i imagine in the last week and a half three terrorists here in turkey succeeded only in blowing themselves up much i suppose to their martyred souls chagrin ive got to hope that these crazy acts are evidence of the pkk or whomever being on its last legs there are important elections national and local coming up on april one eight th so well probably get a chance to see just how long those legs are hope all is well drop me a line marko ______________________________________________________ get your private free email at httpwwwhotmailcom,21:20:00,No

to deliver on winter gas i would like to prepare an answer in case anyone asks power points time for a bronx miracle in houston by mark golden one one zero two two zero zero one dow jones energy service copyright c two zero zero one dow jones company inc a dow jones newswires column new york dow jones with two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down by two runs with one man on enron corp ene needs nothing less than a home run just to stay in the game this is the home run enron must come up with full disclosure of the assets and liabilities of those troubled partnerships that have been kept off their balance sheet and proof the corporation can cover the difference its what stockholders bondholders and trading partners have been demanding but time is running out and enron hasnt produced were going to get to that number soon and tell people we have to do that said a source at enron who didnt know how quickly the disclosure would come or whether it would be independently audited in this environment we are going to be absolutely sure that its accurate enron has about three three billion in debt on the two key partnerships payable in two zero zero three the company will sell the assets in those partnerships and in a worse case scenario will face a one billion shortfall that could be covered by selling stock and other company assets enron has said the company hopes that when the time comes to issue new stock shares will be trading closer to two zero than their current one one investors however arent acting as if theyre reassured part of the trouble analysts with creditrating firm standard poors said friday morning is that until enron sells the assets nobody knows for sure what theyre worth or how deep the partnerships are in the hole sp is confident that enron can raise enough capital to fill that hole provided its trading partners in key energy markets continue to business with the company credit derivative fizzle to see the pickle the worlds premier energy franchise is in one needs to look no further than its credit derivatives trading desk that relatively new and innovative operation was getting off the ground nicely but the desk hasnt been able to transact for three weeks since the value of enrons stock and bonds began to plummet according to another enron employee enron didnt respond to a request for comment but the enron credit division in europe said in a release that lines are constrained as the market continues to evaluate the companys credit position until recently customers would buy a credit derivative from enron to cover its exposure to bankruptcy by a third company a big supplier to a financially troubled company like xerox corp xrx or lucent technologies lu for example might pay enron one million a year for a payout of say one zero million in the event of a bankruptcy but you wouldnt pay the premium on your insurance unless you were sure that the insurance company could pay your claims likewise with enrons creditworthiness in doubt theres no reason to pay a lot of money just to exchange lucent risk for enron risk the same holds true though less obviously for enrons core business of energy trading some utilities large industrial companies and other energy trading companies could see their profits ruined if natural gas prices already on the rise at three per million british thermal units shoot to one zero this winter as they did last winter to guard against that risk companies buy contracts now for delivery this winter at set prices if a company wants to lock in winter gas at three should it turn to enron if gas were to rise to one zero in january and enron couldnt deliver enrons counterparty paid a good price for no protection and if enron failed in a one zero gas market that would send hundreds of companies scrambling for supplies gas could go to two zero in a heartbeat leading role an asset enron does have a man on base the company is so important to energy market participants that they desperately want enron to survive and any company that moves to lock enron out of the market now could regret doing so if enron survives as the big dog enrons trading partners have a pretty consistent position at this point they are continuing to trade with enron but are avoiding longterm deals that increase their exposure to the company the only acceptable longterm deals are those that offset deals done earlier unless and until a bill goes unpaid theyll keep delivering enron like the rest of the us energy industry paid its bills for september gas deliveries on oct two zero and for its september electricity deliveries on oct two five its next power and gas bills come due in the third week of november that means trading companies generally have just seven weeks of receivables at risk before enrons creditworthiness faces another test in exchange for taking on that small risk they keep the great market maker in business lenders show concerns lenders whether through holding enron bonds or providing loans dont have the same luxury as energy trading companies that are keeping deals on a short leash lenders supply cash up front and for longer periods of time usually years outside of longterm commitments what worries the banks which presumably got a good look at enrons books if enron is now unable to make the big bets with longterm energy deals that have kept it profitable for years can it service all of its liabilities known and unknown if it has to sell profitable assets like pipelines and power plants or otherwise put those assets at risk will lower earnings be enough to pay rising credit costs what happens if its greatest asset its traders leave in droves to work elsewhere if enron is to have a chance it needs energy trading profits to keep rolling in so that it can continue to service its debt so far this year trading and other wholesale operations have accounted for two two billion out of two four billion in net recurring income before interest and taxes by comparison enron has made six one seven million in interest payments so far this year jp morgan chase co jpm and citigroup inc c unit salomon smith barney at least dont show much confidence enron can do it when they agreed to provide enron with a one billion line of credit they did so only after enron posted valuable gas pipelines as collateral bond traders the most sophisticated investors in the world make their money by understanding the probabilities theyre trading enron debt at levels typically associated with distressed companies the lenders have chalked up their runs shareholders have ratcheted up the pressure enron now must step up to the plate by mark golden dow jones newswires two zero one nine three eight four six zero four

nine edith cross and i turned over every rock that we could find booked things properly and moved on i know nothing about this amortization thats been going on perhaps there were two payments to fort james one being the payment that west power trading expensed in one nine nine seven associated with the in money waunahalsey position and the other associated with the overall alliance west power trading very clearly liquidated the payment associated with waunahalsey in one nine nine seven i have the dpr from march of one nine nine seven to prove it if this payment was capitalized for some reason after west power trading expensed it then im not sure what to do it seems odd for us to pay for the same bad position twice if the amortization is associated with the second payment to fort james the alliance payment then we have a different kettle of fish entirely i dont understand why it was ok for the amotization to hit the industrial group but when we do a onetime amortization of the balance it all of a sudden switches over to the west power trading group how come last month it was proper for the charge to hit the industrial group and this month it is proper for the charge to hit west power trading the charge should hit whoevers rc it was who thought that paying fort james a bunch of money was a good idea if that person is no longer around the charge should either hit that persons successor or it should hit a management book to your point about who benefits from the termination of this deal clearly it is a good idea to terminate these deals and remove bad positions with a lot of uncertainty from the west power trading books having said that i have a hard time feeling good about the benefit that west power trading has received from these deals in one nine nine nine i was told that this was largely a legal question a memo written by jake thomas on april seven one nine nine nine memorializes this line of thought we established a five zero zero k legal reserve rebooked the deals took most of the positive value to the book to offset large losses associated with other old deals and granted the remainder about one million to jake in origination the entity that has benefited the most from these deals is west origination finally i cant see how this expense belongs to west power trading i would like to understand how all of the accounting worked before i can accept an expense on my rc if you want to deal with the expense separately and have a discussion about granting origination for terminating this deal then lets do that that discussion needs to reflect history and include the origination that was granted in one nine nine seven one nine nine nine and include the legal reserve of five zero zero k give me a call when you get a chance david w delainey zero six one six two zero zero zero zero five one one pm to tim beldenhouectect cc subject fort james amortization tim my understanding is that partnership fee the one one zero m has been amortized for the last several years and expensed to the industrial groups mcconville and ondarza as you are aware i sued them for breach the settlement involved the elimination of all existing transactions between ft james and enron including the wauna and halsey power contracts it is my understanding that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the portland shop the elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement i originated it seemed logical to charge the portland office with the remaining unamortized fee of one eight m as a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent liability lets discuss regards delainey forwarded by david w delaineyhouect on zero six one six two zero zero zero zero seven zero zero pm from tim belden zero six one six two zero zero zero zero five zero nine pm to wes colwellhouectect david w delaineyhouectect john j lavoratocorpenron cc paula harrishouectect subject fort james amortization edith cross and i looked at the fort james deal in great detail in early one nine nine nine when the deal was closed west power trading booked an in the money position and an offsetting expense of about one one million this money has already liquidated from our book in fact i have a copy of the three three one nine seven dpr that reflects this liquidation at that time west power trading also paid a three five zero k credit reserve two four seven k to the finance book and one three million in origination i have also heard about a partnership fee that enron paid to fort james around the same time im not sure what this fee was and who benefitted from it it had nothing to do with the west power trading book on johns recommendation i called wes to see if we could figure this out wes please give me a call back to discuss i think that someone needs to look at the actual journal entries from march of one nine nine seven to see why an expense of one one million was deferred this is not my problem i should not receive this expense until this is resolved i would greatly appreciate it if the writedown of the deferred account does not hit west power tradings

move the two way so i can try simulating actual market cicumstances from david forsterenronenronxgate on zero five zero eight two zero zero one zero nine five five am to john arnoldhouectect cc savita puthigaienronenronxgate subject john you might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more intelligence for outofhours trading than just leaving the products on last trade is mid attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work it builds on offset to last trade functionality the simplified description is it tracks two variables intensityspeed and bias buy or sell emphasis as intensity increases the spread increases as bias increases the offset increases ill call later to see what you think of the idea dave program criteria the formula which defines the trading decisionmaking program will need to work with several criteriainputsdefinitions these might be intensity speed the average time between transaction attempts regardless of whether they are buys or sells measured as a moving average over the last intensity factor transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction tibco messages for the product obviously the lower the intensity calculation the higher the transaction flow therefore a high intensity number indicates low transaction flow intensity factor the number of transactions to be included in the moving average intensity calculation a possible value for this might be four buys the number of buys which have occurred sells the number of sells which have occured transaction count could be either buys or sells whichever last occured buy offset the offset value which will be applied if a buy occurs sell offset the offset value which will be applied if a sell occurs offset reversion ratio orr the amount by which the buy offset should be reduced if a sell occurs or amount sell offset should be reduced if a buy occurs a possible value for this might be zero three if the application of the orr results in a reduction of less than one then the reduction shall be one transaction reversion ratio trr the amount by which buys should be reduced if a sell occurs or amount sells should be reduced if a buy occurs a possible value for this might be zero three if the application of the trr results in a reduction of less than one then the reduction shall be equal to one spread minimum the minimum spread value allowed a possible value for this might be zero zero four spread maximum the maximum spread value allowed a possible value for this might be zero five zero offset minimum the minimum offset allowed for both buys and sells a possible value for this might be zero offset maximum the maximum offset allowed for both buys and sells a possible value for this might be zero five zero initial offset the buy and sell offset used when the program is started initial spread the spread used when the program is started spreadoffset minimum the minimum amount by which spread must exceed offset prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer a possible value for this might be zero zero one dead interval the period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above criteria if no transactions have taken place during the dead interval a possible value for this might be two four zero seconds program outputs the program should output the following variables as a result of combining the above criteria in a userdefined formula spread integer as per current stack manager offset integer as per current stack manager suspension boolean whether or not the product should be suspended normally false program interface and operation principles the user should be provided with a gui which will allow them to define a relationship among the above criteria which will produce and apply the outputs to a particular product this relationship would be defined with intensity formulas and transaction formulas every time a transaction occurs or a dead interval passes the criteria will be recalculated and the userdefined formulas will be reviewed by the program if a dead interval passes without any transactions taking place then intensity intensity two four zero and buysbuystrr and sellssellstrr and buy offset buy offset orr and sell offset sell offset orr if the userdefined formulas see following indicate that a change in spread should occur then if the offset is zero in the case of a trade occurring or if no trade has occured during the passing of a dead interval the system shall perform a last trade is mid calculation around the last transaction adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new spread value any adjustment to the spread shall respect the spreadoffset minimum if a reduction in the spread should violate the spreadoffset minimum then the buy offset or sell offset or both as appropriate shall be reduced accordingly similarly if the offset is increased by a transaction formula to a level greater than the spread the spread shall be increased

the warning levels will trigger a pager message the failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be automatically suspended the price checks will be against prices input by the

xcel as public service supported deregulation legislation in the general assembly wilde of wilexco said selling electricity in a deregulated market wasnt the reason his firm sought to build its plant

four six one six inevitably you are going to get some profittaking as we get near the end of the quarter and people want to lock in some of their profits said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey ed tirello of deutsche banc alex brown said the decline was due in part to investors viewing enron as a technology play because of its online trading and broadband businesses consequently enrons stock was susceptible to weakness in the techheavy nasdaq market this month which appeared to have triggered selling by momentum investors tirello said merrill lynchs eassey said enrons stock might also have been hurt by an article in the weekly texas supplement to the wall street journal which called into question the trading profits reported by enron and other big energy marketers eassey dismissed the article as misleading and said he retained a buy rating on enrons stock with a one two monthprice target of nine five this is a stock that youve got to have in your core portfolio enron is still

 Regarding our PX Credit Claim and Meeting with Edison Tomorrow",edison has dripped out information over the last four eight hours that reveals what the team had anticipated for some time edison will pay esps what they are owed wrt the negative ctc when they pay everyone else sometime in qone zero two however edison has told us and will tell esps today that they intend to very aggressively push the puc to charge da customers for their fair share of the px credit since in their view da customers through the negative ctc contributed to the undercollection no more and no less than bundled customers did they claim they are on the side of the angels because it is an equity issue and that allowing da not to pay would be a massive jailbreak their calculation is simple if da represents one zero of the load then da is responsible for paying down one zero of the undercollection edison wants the undercollection recovered over the period of its settlement they claim that based on their calculations they can recover it over two years in short edison is zeroing out payables tied to negative ctc by forcing espsda customers to pay it back through rates over the next two years in a conversation yesterday edison said that it is not attempting to link the two that is they are not making payment of pxcreditrelated debt on agreement by esps to pay a portion of edisons undercollection through rates over the next two years presumably in this way edison can say we said that we would pay our creditors and we did it was the puc who sets the rates and decided to claw back by charging espsda customers as part of the normal course of fulfilling its regulatory responsibilities implications clearly negative from the perspective of expeditiously recognizing earnings for amounts edison says it will pay us when it pays everyone else in qone equally important it may increase significantly the risk of recognizing earnings for what pge will pay us if the puc addresses whether espsda customers should contribute to pay down edisons undercollection it will likely also want to address the issue for pge we need to discuss the extent to which the puc can meddle with pge in this regard given that pge is pursuing its work out through bankruptcy impact on tomorrows meeting i still think it is constructive to meet facetoface with edison tomorrow but wanted to give folks the option of doing it by conference call we still have to determine whether we have agreement on what they owe us this includes calculations up to jan one seven the period from jan one seven to when we put our customers back on bundled service and the period since theyve been returned to da status since edison claims they will pay everyone at the same timesometime in qone zero two there seems to be some value in determining what that number is and getting the agreement in writing second it would be useful to explore with edison why they have chosen to take an extreme hardball stance on the issue given that the px credit issues represents about two four three mmsix b four five of the total debt in addition it would be useful to let edison know that they are in for a very long protracted litigation struggle if once theyve paid us they attempt to take it back through ratemaking shenanigans at the puc in yesterdays conversation with fielder i told him that edison is ensuring world war three and that theyd better prepare for it if they intend to pursue this unreasonable approach however i tried to keep things as cordial as possible in an effort not to close down communications altogether other esps and da customers are likely to oppose edisons proposal sues informing the arm coalition of what edisons up to,09:13:50,No

meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person we will know how to be grateful for that gift when the door of happiness closes another opens but often times we look so long at the closed door that we dont see the one which has been opened for us the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing withnever say a word and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation youve ever had its true that we dont know what weve got until we lose it but its also true that we dont know what weve been missing until it arrives giving someone all your love is never an assurance that theyll love you back dont expect love in return just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesnt be content it grew in yours it takes only a minute to get a crush on someone an hour to like someoneand a day to love someone but it takes a lifetime to forget someone dont go for looks they can deceive dont go for wealth even that fades awaygo for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright find the one that makes your heart smile there are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real dream what you want to dream go where you want to go be what you want to bebecause you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do may you have enough happiness to make you sweet enough trials to make you strong enough sorrow to keep you human enough hope to make you happy always put yourself in others shoes if you feel that it hurts

a few folks from our group who have been looking at this i want to make sure that it would be an efficient use of your time and that we would not be duplicating anything i will have lindy contact you so we can set something up and then move forward as necessary thanks steve original message from davidafotiaccenturecomenron sent tuesday october three zero two zero zero one seven two zero am to harris steven subject ecs contract review new idea steve i worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for my time one seven five hour normal rate is three five zero i would like to send you an engagement letter this week for up to three weeks or one two zero hours two one k i think we can get it done in less time but the one two zero hours provides some flexibility if we decide to go deeper on something we would only charge you for the hours we use i am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring options as well as the npv income and operational effect for each to the extent time allows i will be able to help negotiate and close whatever option you choose in order for me to offer our preferred rate it is important to note that i would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible basis eg friday meetings emails and phone vs being onsite three weeks fulltime even with this flexible structure i feel confident that we can have the deliverable complete by mid december please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with these terms as for the new idea i have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset positionmarket intelligence it occurred to me that there is an analogy here that relates to pipelines pipelines have operational events that may have market effects unplanned outage majorminordurationnotice planned outages over a certain volume operation flow order sols key plants backed in takes over schedule volumes key points linepack levels pressure drops at key points since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through gas needed for operational purchases it is rationale that these phenomena would be studied and acted read traded upon in order to minimize tws market risk read generate income tw can setup a risk management group to execute this idea it is not unusual for a pipeline to have a risk management function duke pipeline for example has a vp of risk management for pipelines these events would be studied in the follow way one determine whether there is a correlation between an event and gas pricesbasis differentials based on historical data two for those events that have a strong correlations develop a trading strategy around the relationship three backtest the trading strategy against historical data determine profitability four for operational events that are applicable setup a system to execute program trading that is directly linked to scada secondary benefits of this risk management trading strategy would be developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of selling the capacity physical vs through basis derivatives or some combination of both steve if

update i moved over from ees to accentures energy group about six months ago and have been focusing on trading and risk management pipeline optimization projects i had an idea which i thought you

decisions they are the standard for electric td companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment this is how i was thinking about using them to structure a deal one tw hires accenture to implement rcm two rcm benefits are determined by a pilot project four weeks three accenture pays tw upfront for one zero years of projected benefits from rcm say two zero mm as part of

vasconcellos brent bowes bill sandt jim subject raptor restructuring gentlemen after talking with both joel ephross and ron baker this morning about the raptor restructuring my understanding of the current plan is summarized below please let me know if i have mischaracterized the proposed approach we have a couple concerns from a tax perspective that are also discussed below one ve is currently drafting documents to allow each raptor structure to look to the other structures in terms of credit capacity two the previously proposed assignment of the ldc swaps from raptor ii to raptor iv is off the table these swaps will now be terminated three either raptor ii or raptor iv will be used to hedge the mariner investment three six zero m instead four the jedi structure is expected to be unwound thus allowing one two m enron corp shares to come back to enron corp and no longer be treated as issued and outstanding for purposes of enrons eps calculation five the value of one two m new enron corp shares would be used to capitalize either raptor ii or raptor iv one two m shares x seven zero approx eight four zero m a as consideration for the contribution of the shares the receivable owed by the lower tier llc to the enron member under the grid note would be increased by the same amount b the credit capacity of the subject raptor structure would increase by an amount equal to the discount on the shares caused by their restricted nature eight four zero m x three five to four five approx two nine four m to three seven eight m c ryan has apparently suggested that the shares actually be transferred to a trust and that the trust issue a forward contract on the shares to the chosen raptor structure we have some concerns about this approach from a tax perspective i would like to better understand the benefits of using a forward contract who would own the beneficial interest in the trust and what followon transactions might be planned regarding the trust d i am still confused about the characterization of the contribution of the additional shares as utilizing the credit capacity of the raptor structure to which they are contributed i can understand why the shares would not increase the credit capacity of the structure but i am told that the potential downside on the enron stock would actually utilize the structures capacity annmarie original message from

applications in the financial arena manufacturing consumer products les s experience with oil and gas but good skills with newer web applications prefer to take entire portions of the projects themselves rather than wo rk collaboratively with customers expensive weaker on actual ma strateg ic work planning of an integration or leading an entire effort like this again prefer to have control rather inflexible in their approach very dedicated to procedure and process which is good to an extentbut tends to spend way too much time with administrative tasks and creating reams of paper and meetings than getting anything done when they are managing an ef fort like this better choice for actual integration work but should giv e them whole applications or departments like finance or distribution for example not good with applications that require a lot of interface with other project teams and multiple business units does not play well with others so carve up chunks of the effort they can do on their own and you w ill get good results lots of ma integration experience as a result of th eir close relationships in the banking industry and consolidation that has been prevalent there over last one five years two zero pwc very strong overall ma strategy great documentation of business pr ocesses for multiple vertical industries which can be very helpful in manag ing projects like this project management tools are strong as is collabo ration with other project teams or other business units particular streng ths in integration work in financial services manufacturing telecomm esp ecially with applications like sap and supply chain price wise middle of the pack good choice for either role but would recommend pwc serve eith er as project manager or as integrator not as both would stretch them to o thin with companies your size and complexity i think two zero deloitte my favorite for ma leadership and integration work solid pric ing great business process documentation through templates they have creat ed very collaborative works well with others solid project mangement experience with ma for about one zero years multiple projects and initiatives good

will al so work to ensure that knowledge transfer occurs so that internal it perso nnel learn as much as they can very customer friendly good choice for e ither component project management of entire merger due to deep knowledg e on process and knowledge data bases also very strong integration practic e if i had to choose i would choose deloitte to manage the project two zero kpmg weakest of all the companies in both project management and integrat ion work has not had a lot of experience with ma leadership does not ha ve the strength of documented tools and business processes of the others actual integration work would be ok especially surrounding sap jdedwards manugistics project management is ok but there are better choices in th e others right now kpmg is undergoing tremendous stresses internally righ t now their european operation is really a loose federation of companies w ho are independantly owned the european portions are attempting to sell t hemselves to kpmg competitors so internal politics detract from the abilit y of this company to focus on a large integration effort that may span one two two four months pricing is highly variable depending upon business unit two zero two zero cap geminiey the old ey had an excellent ma practice that had years o f experience with actually constructing deals managing efforts and doing integration work cap gemini has some experience with actual integration o f companies as they have been involved in key mergers in europe and have d one some pretty impressive work with large complex integration efforts c ap gemini presence still very very weak in the us ey personnel are still in the majority however the ey personnel in the us are mainly in the ma nagement consultancy area very few of the actual integration programmers r emain here most of that work is being done by the cap gemini side of the house in europe cap gemini and ey have done an impressive job with their own merger one of the better run efforts in recent years so from that pe rspective they would be an interesting choice tools and methodology for p roject management are strong integration work in us has been weakened a bi t since the majority of this work has been passed over to cap and caps st rength resides in europe pricing is midrange good value for dollar ex perience with the major erp and crm apps less experience with supply chain and buying exchanges would be a good choice for project management and if integration work were to have a major european component would be a goo d choice for that portion of a project like this two zero bottom line best choices for project management in order of preference deloitte consulting pwc cgey accenture kpmg best choices for integration work accenturedeloitte pwc cgey higher in preference if big european component kpmg warning with accenture d oes not play well with others and does not collaborate well with clients if however enron prefers to have a company

of the early entrants in the market having hit on the idea of laying fibreoptic cables along his railway rightsofway an idea that became a three zero billion company called qwest communications which is merging with us west williams cos had the same idea of laying fibre alongside its pipelines and later sold that business to mci worldcom in one nine nine five for two five billion the company is now completing a new network through subsidiary williams communications in canada albertabased construction company ledcor started laying fibre as it was repairing tracks for cn rail and sold access to phone and internet companies that business became three six zero networks a separate unit that is expected to go public this week so where were pipeline and energy companies like transcanada and nova and enbridge formerly ipl and westcoast while all this was going on well nova was busy trying to be a chemical and a pipeline company and then it and transcanada were busy fighting the alliance pipeline project and then they decided to merge in one of the worlds alltime worst merger deals now transcanada has its hands full trying to replace the billions in market value it has managed to lose over the past year westcoast and enbridge have focused on pipelines and related interests and they have both done a good job of it but they remain tied to fundamentally lowmargin businesses enron has swung for the fences and thats why its stock has climbed from the four five range last fall to about six five given its exposure to technology enron has suffered a little bit lately enron isnt the only one building the pipes for the information industry mind you established companies such as qwest and worldcom own extensive networks while newer entrants such as global crossing and three six zero networks are building or buying them enron even has competition from energy firms such as bp amoco and pge who recently bought a stake in a company called aerie networks that is building a network using their pipeline rightsofway six other us energy companies have a similar joint venture with all this building some industry watchers have raised the spectre of a bandwidth glut and it is conceivable there will be some kind of consolidation but enron is in a good position to be one of the consolidators and meanwhile the company is taking advantage of the increase in demand for fibre capacity by setting up a bandwidth trading market this is another area where energy companies like enron have an advantage they are already accustomed to sophisticated trading and hedging of commodities such as pipeline capacity and natural gas enron for example is a leader in energy trading and risk management whats so different about selling space on a fibreoptic pipeline not much can a single company explore produce and ship natural gas produce and sell electric power and become a leader in internet infrastructure all at the same time that remains to be seen but enron appears determined to try and thats why brokerage firms such as merrill lynch say it has a chance to become the general electric of the new economy,02:09:00,No

stewart vs me marthas way one stuff a miniature marshmallow in the bottom of a sugar cone to prevent ice cream drips my way just suck the ice cream out of the bottom of the cone for petes sake you are probably lying on the couch with your feet up eating it anyway marthas way two use a meat baster to squeeze your pancake batter onto the hot griddle and youll get perfectly shaped pancakes every time my way buy the precooked kind you nuke in the microwave for three zero seconds the hard part is getting them out of the plastic bag marthas way three to keep potatoes from budding place an apple in the bag with the potatoes my way buy hungry jack mashed potato mix and keep it in the pantry for up to a year marthas way four to prevent egg shells from cracking add a pinch of salt to the water before hard boiling my way who cares if they crack arent you going to take the shells off anyway marthas way five to get the most juice out of fresh lemons bring them to room temperature and roll them under your palm against the kitchen counter before squeezing my way sleep with the lemons in between the mattress and box springs marthas way six to easily remove burnton food from your skillet simply add a drop or two of dish soap and enough water to cover bottom of pan and bring to a boil on stovetop my way eat at chilis every night and avoid cooking marthas way seven spray your tupperware with nonstick cooking spray before pouring in tomato based sauces and there wont be any stains my way feed your garbage disposal and there wont be any leftovers marthas way eight when a cake recipe calls for flouring the baking pan use a bit of the dry cake mix instead and there wont be any white mess on the outside of the cake my way go to the bakery theyll even decorate it for you marthas way nine

way celery never heard of the stuff marthas way one one brush some beaten egg white over pie crust before baking to yield a beautiful glossy finish my way the mrs smith frozen pie directions do not include brushing egg whites over the crust and so i dont do it marthas way one two place a slice of apple in hardened brown sugar to soften it my way brown sugar is supposed to be soft marthas way one

wasnt fresh marthas way one five cure for headaches take a lime cut it in half and rub it on your forehead the throbbing will go away my way martha dear the only reason this works is because you cant rub a lime on your forehead without getting lime juice in your eye and then the problem isnt the headache anymore it is because you are now blind marthas way one six dont throw out all that leftover wine freeze into ice cubes for future use in casseroles and sauces my way leftover wine marthas way one seven if you have a problem opening jars try using latex dishwashing gloves they give a non slip

are interesting results i am on vacation next week so here are my current thoughts i am contactable on my mobile if necessary gas to power correlations i see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting var for the combined gas and power portfolio and this raises an interesting point at a conservative three zero long term correlation combined var is oone mm less than previously expected so how does this affect the limit breach strictly speaking we are still over our uk power limit but the limit was set when we were assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio var a suggested way forward given the importance of the spread options to the uk gas and power books can we allocate to the gas and power books a share of the reduction in portfolio var ie reduction portfolio var sumpower var gas var also if i understand your mail correctly matrix one implies five five gas power correlation is consistent with our correlation curves and this reduces total var by oone eight mm efa slot correlations the issue of whether our existing efa to efa correlation matrix is correct is a separate issue i dont understand where the matrix two efa to efa correlations come from but i am happy for you to run some historical correlations from the forward curves use the first two years i would suggest our original matrix was based on historicals but the analysis is worth doing again your matrix two results certainly indicate how important these correlations are closing thoughts fridays trading left us longer so i would not expect a limit breach on monday we are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve and id like to wait until both simon hastings and i are back in the office monday week before finalising this regards richard tanya

hewittlonectect naveen andrewscorpenronenron david portmarket riskcorpenronenron ted murphyhouectect cc subject re var correlation scenarios everybody oliver sent us the var number for different correlations for ukpower portfolio separately from ukgas portfolio first if var is calculated accurately the correlation between power and gas curves should not affect var number for power and var number for gas only the aggregate number will be affected the changes you see are due to the fact that we use montecarlo simulation method which accuracy depends on the number of simulations even if we dont change the correlations but use different realizations of random numbers we get slightly different result from the model so to see the effect of using different correlations between gas and power we should look at the aggregate number i calculated weighted correlations based on two curves i got from paul as the weights along the term structure i used the product of price position and volatility for each time bucket for gas and each of efa slots the results are shown below inserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix produced negatively definite correlation matrix which brakes var engine correlation matrix for any set of random variables is nonnegative by definition and remains nonnegatively definite if calculated properly based on any historical data here according to our phone discussion we started experimenting with correlations assuming the same correlation for each efa slot and et elec versus gas i am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results in addition to the aggregate var numbers for the runs oliver did you can see the var numbers based on correlation matrix one and matrix two in matrix one the correlations across efa slots are identical to these in original matrix i obtained this matrix by trial and error matrix two is produces by naveen using fingers algorithm it differs from original matrix across efa slots as well as in power versus gas correlations and gives higher var than matrix one does concluding we will look at the historical forward prices and try to calculate historical correlations from them tanya oliver

being applied within the model once we can derive single correlations from the term structure is the next action to understand how they are being applied and whether the model captures the pl

sometimes the best thin g to do is laugh a little with that said im forwarding a column i found entertaining from one of our favorite sportswriters bill simmons of espncom i do this every so often and i always get a bunch of email yelling about i didnt sign up for this and to keep it serious and on football sav e your breath unsubscribe instructions are at the bottom of this email lets jump to mr simmons you can find the original article here httpespngocompagetwo ssimmonszero one one zero two three html lighten up joe whazzup with the nfl by bill simmons espncom with apologies to cnnsis peter king here are one zero things i think i think after six weeks of the nfl season one i think this has been the strangest nfl season in recent memory the media usually starts their this has been the strangest season ever buzz around week five or week six its an nfl october tradition right up there with my girlfriend asking on sunday at noon if i want to go applepicking me following that question up with the answer what are you insane and her storming out of the house but this season really has been the strangest season of alltime consider the following things twenty of the three one nfl teams have records of five zero zero or better the short list of quality teams this season includes chicago san diego and san francisco combined record last season one two three six out of the nine consensus super bowl contenders from the preseason only three of them green bay st louis and philadelphia have winning records the other six indy tampa baltimore tennessee denver and the giants ar e a combined one five one eight after the favorites went three five two one against the spread in the first four weeks the underdogs went two two four two over the next two weeks two two four two thats impossible the patriots are slightly aboveaverage as a football team maybe even a little better when you factor in their coaching staff and team chemistry and there isnt an nfl team they couldnt beat if they played well and get two or three breaks no two zero zero one victory is out of their grasp seriously and just for the record i feel the same way about the browns and falcons along those same lines other than st louis there isnt a reliable favorite in the league anymore remember the days when you could count on a contender to bounce back from an embarrassing defeat the following week what happened to denver and baltimore last week didnt they get the memo remember the days when you could throw two quality home teams into a twoteam tease and assume they would cover at home like tampa new orleans and indianapolis for instance remember the days when the home team was money on monday nights like this week with the giants i miss those days and so does my wallet so whats left im not sure we already achieved pete rozelles vision of a paritydriven nfl two seasons ago when the two zero zero toone underdog rams cruised to a super bowl title now weve reached a point where the league has becom e predictably unpredictable its a gamblers worst nightmare which reminds me two i think the local weatherman in hell will report temperatures in the midteens all weekend before i wager on a team that prominently features jo n kitna again two a i think that theres excruciating theres really excruciating and then theres the experience of watching carolinas chris weinke throwing tw o interceptions inside the one zero yardline in the first half against a brutal redskins team then singlehandedly giving the skins life with one zero minutes remaining in a one four zero game by tossing a screen pass right to lavar arrington for a six seven yard interception and touchdown can everyone who wagered on the panthers last sunday file a classaction suit against weinke has this ever been done before two b i think the lesson here as always is never wager on a team with a crappy qb and i knew this i knew this normally id fine myself but the financial bloodbath has already been devastating enough does anyone know a good pawn shop in the boston area whoops im using my outloud voice again two c i think i miss the days when you could recoup your one pm gambling losses by wagering on two sturdy four pm teams in message game situations for instance sunday featured denver coming off an embarrassing loss in seattle and heading into san diego for an afc west tilt as well as the packers looking to drive a stake in minnesotas season and extend their lea d in the nfc central in the old days you could rely on the mike shanahans and brett favres of the world to save your butt not anymore as i told my buddy jbug last night this has become a league which i am unfamiliar with all of the gambling rules accrued over the years you might as well throw them out the window i give up three i think i always get excited for those coors light commercials with barr y sanders for one reason sanders possesses the strangest hairline of anyone on the planet and just for the record that includes shane battier roy firestone elton john and brad daugherty note somebody needs to release the barry sanders wig for halloween this month along with the dave campo wig the troy aikman concussion mask the dave wannstedt fake mustache the al groh blowup doll and the fred taylor pull your own groin startup kit im telling you nfl collectibles shoul d have a whole halloween department its a nobrainer they could even release an nfl legends collection so we could finally get our hands on the bruce coslet wig can somebody make this happen please four i think it took one six frustrating years but doug flutie finally found the right nfl team its funny how life works out had the bills decided to keep him over rob johnson flutie would have spent his twilight years on a rebuilding team instead hes the proverbial right guy right place righ t time on a team where he doesnt have to carry the offensive load unles s its absolutely necessary like sunday when denver stacked the line agains t the sublime ladainian tomlinson putting the game in fluties hands four a i think tampa bay made an enormous mistake going for brad johnson over flutie and i think it probably costs tony dungy his job within the next one to four months four b i think its fair to say that the list of reliable quarterbacks who ca n consistently win games has been whittled down to four brett favre kurt warner jeff garcia and flutie thats it thats the list think about it daunte culpepper and donovan mcnabb make too many mistakes brian griese rich gannon and mark brunell are only as good as the people around them peyton manning is slapping together a karl malonetype career and his ewing theory potential is jumping off the charts steve mcnair an d chris chandler cant stay healthy drew bledsoe has been hideously exposed by tom brady more on this in a second look at the list again favre warner flutie and garcia three of those four guys were forced to prove themselves in other professional leagues before another nfl team even gave them a chance i ask you again is this a weird nfl season or what five i think weve reached the section of the one zero things column where im supposed to talk about nonsports items like high school field hockey and starbucks racking my brain all right im ashamed to admit this but monday night i went to see the new drew barrymore movie riding in cars with boys accompanying the sports gal as p art of our she wont bitch about the fact that i spend seven hours every sunday watching football if i escort her to an occasional chick flick and dont bitch about it deal savvy huh i only have two hopes with chick flicks that theyre short and that there s a cute actress prominently involved needless to say since riding in cars lasted for one four zero interminable minutes and the wheels came off the drew barrymore is a babe bandwagon about three years ago i spent the last four five minutes trying to pull a piece of metal off the bottom of my seat so i coul d jam it into my jugular vein even the sports gal didnt like the movie that much and this is coming from a person who was peeved that the academy awar d committee snubbed the wedding planner last spring five disturbing phenomenons about the chick flick every chick flick has a scene where either a a male baby pees on somebody b theres a wedding andor c theres an unredeeming male character who lets somebody down this is apparently a rule if you can work all three of those scenes in the same movie the director apparently gets a five zero zero zero zero bonus whenever i see a chick flick theres always a moment when i accidentally make eye contact with another boyfriend or spouse at the theater and we quickly glance away its like seeing somebody in the adult section of a video store youre just hoping nobody will recognize you and things will move along as quickly as possible ill sum up the storyline from every chick flick men suck theres always a specific threesome sitting somewhere in the theater during every chick flick one girl sitting between two guys why two i have no idea usually they seem like platonic friends the girl isnt very attractive at least one of the guys looks like tim burton and the guys overlaugh at every joke in the movie to the point that you start rooting for one of them to choke to death on a sour patch kid again im not sure whats going on here every time you block out the fact that youre watching a chick flick something funny happens and everyone in the theater starts laughing a highpitched cacophony of giggles that reminds you hey im at a chick flick thats usually when i start bludgeoning myself over the head with m y one two eight ounce mountain dew anyway on a scale of one to one zero id give riding cars with boys a minusone three lets forget this section ever happened and if youre attending any showings of serendipity in the boston area over the next few weeks and se e someone who looks like me please dont make eye contact with that person for everyones sake six i think the tom brady era is taking the ewing theory to the next level especially considering that your buddy sports guy predicted a ewingresurgence for the patriots before week three you had the overhyped overvalued superstar who never really won anything and received an inordinate amount of media attention and fan hype drew bledsoe you had the requisite injury during the season that caused everyone to write the team off bledsoe going down in week two possibly for the season you had everyone writing the team off and then you had the team immediately running off a three one streak including two i cant believe this is happening wins both over indy as well as an improbable comeback win over san diego showing more life than theyve shown in years now you have the local media searching for answers to explain how a team can lose its franchise player and inexplicably start playing better and everyone keeps saying that the patriots have come out o f nowhere you know better just for the record i officially abandoned my seat on the bledsoe bandwago n at two three zero on sunday afternoon when the pats took a two eight six lead in indianapolis and i called my father just to pretend i was paul tagliabue announcing with the first pick of the two zero zero two expansion draft the houston texans select drew bledsoe quarterback new england patriots sounds farfetched remember they signed bledsoe to a mammoth contract extension last spring they couldnt trade him without absorbing an impossible salary cap hit but according to nfl rules any player who gets selected in the expansion draft has his contract and cap figure transferred to the texans even the prorated bonus payments which means the pats could leave bledsoe unprotected and hope the texans gobble him up which would clear one zero million to one two million in cap space to spend in free agents next spring mmmmmm cap space seven i think tampa bay and indianapolis should trade coaches dungy straightup for jim mora why dont teams ever trade coaches in sports whats the worst thing that could happen what about marty schottenheimer and two schottenheimers to be named later for george seifert and cash couldnt this work or am i crazy eight i think buffalos travis henry always looks like one of those stubborn buffaloes on the discovery channel that fight off four or five cheetahs before they finally get dragged down last week against the jaguars he had five seven carries for six five yards even though he was hit three yards behind the line by four defenders on every carry high comedy his career might not last until november at this rate nine i think chicago and pittsburgh are shaping up as the out of nowhere teams in each conference this season those basement teams that beef up against crappy opponents shock the experts win one zero one one games and scare the heck out of the bookmakers in vegas given that they were long shots to win it all before the season both teams run the ball effectively avoid takin g chances on offense swarm the ball on defense and make plays on special teams in other words theyre following baltimores two zero zero zero playbook to a tee chicagos resurgence wasnt that improbable given that somebody strange wa s coming out of the nfc central but pittsburgh did you ever envision the m at four one when four of their first five were on the road now they finish up with seven of their last one one at home yikes its almost enough to make you forget that kordell stewarts still involved almost keep in mind just in case the bears or steelers stumble over the next few weeks there are an inordinate amount of other out of nowhere candidates san fran four one san diego four two cleveland four two atlanta three three and new england three three for all we know all of those teams might make the playoffs this season but the schedule seems to favor chicago and pittsburgh over everyone else for all we know all of those teams might sneak into the playoffs its been that kind of season one zero i think that any given sunday was a flawed movie to say the least crippled by brutal editing suicidal casting decisions and a script that meandered all over the place and yet one scene makes it all worth it you know the one its the scene when al pacino as coach tony demarco throws the movie on his back before the big game you know when you get old in life things get taken from you thats part of life but you only learn that when you start losing stuff you find out that lifes a game of inches so is football because in either game life or football the margin for error is so small i mean one half a step too late or too early and you dont quite make it one halfsecond too slow o r too fast you dont quite catch it the inches we need are everywhere aroun d us theyre in every break of the game every minute every second now the players are clapping on this team we fight for that inch on this team we tear ourselves and everyone around us for that inch we claw with our fingernails for that inch because we know that when we add up all those inches we know thats gonna make the difference between winning and losing between living and dyingnow the players are screaming along with every wordi ll tell you this in any fight its the guy whos willing to die whosg onna win that inch now i cant make you do it you gotta look at thegu y next to ya look into his eyes and i think youre gonna see a guy whowi ll go that inch with youthe light bulb finally clicks for enigmatic qb willie beamon he strollstoward his coach inspired youre gonn a see a guy who will sacrifice himself for this team because heknows when it comes down to it youre gonna do the same for him thats ateam gentl eman and either we heal now as a team or we will die asindividuals thats football guys thats all it isdramatic pausenow what ar e you gonna docomplete pandemonium in the locker room chills galore and the team burstsout of the locker room in slow motion and i cant think of a better way to end this column back to serious stuff nowjoe bryant analytics inc all rights rese rved one
