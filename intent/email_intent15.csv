organizational chart leading and being a part of t his group has been a privilegei am thankful for every day that i have had that responsibility and thankful for however long i continue to have the re

zero zero one three three pm chris mahoney zero nine two nine two zero zero zero zero two one six am to mike mcconnellhouectect jeffrey a shankmanhouectect john l nowlanhouectect greg whalleyhouectect cc subject how to go forward in the oil markets customer business eol jeff i think your ideas of adding marketing and research analysis to the group are good starting points i dont feel this will increase revenues for us in two zero zero one as our efforts here are only to win volume from others in a thin volume environment eventually the captured deal flow should help the group trade from a better knowledge base but for the next year it will require a significant recruitment and training effort both the recruitment and the teaching process are ones that we need to focus on please let me know what you have in mind on the recruitment side and i would like to highlight that i feel there are very few people to teach the analysts and associates i plan on spending an increasing amount of my time working with the younger team that im assembling in london by end october the london office will have five managers four associates and one analyst in our group this is a real shift from the approach of the past where the focus was on recruiting directors given our previous track record on recruiting from the outside about three three success in terms of performing well and acclimating to enron i think this is the right approach but we must realise this is a slower process when we look to revenue growth and one that will also require us to shift more focus toward teaching my plan is to put much of the associate resources toward eol marketing initially and see what talents they have for being marketing and analysis the one analyst joining the group is coming over one of the consulting companies in london and im putting him in charge of drawing up a list of potential customers in every european country please let me know if you have any plans of bringing somebody in to organise globally the marketing business cant help but feel that we are very marginal in the electronic trading of oil and could lose all of our business in the near future having seen the ice demo i would prefer that system of ours because of volume this is a complaint that i have heard from many traders regarding the use of our system the challenge is how can we put up more volumes more markets and tighter two ways to convince more people to trade with us and not get run over what do we know about the espeed system and what they are going to have i saw a reuters story saying they were launching oct two nd with koch dynergy entergy willams and a few others are we thinking about trying to join up oil markets with either of these two sites and what are the plans if we do begin some of the small customer basis we do have this is area that we giving a great deal of effort and attention to but what are our plans if we fail to be the largest in this platform i dont feel that in the oil business we will be successful unless we can be the most preferred site because most companies will not have two websites up on the computers we are having a difficult time getting anybody but the most aggressive trading companies to look at our numbers so it seems difficult to believe the industry will look at two different etrading sites building the physical trading business this has always received lukewarm interest from enron i believe that the inefficiency within the oil markets is not great enough to try and profit on that alone so when we talk about going big that really means getting involved in some kind of steel and trying to dominate certain aspects of the physical business tankage and shipping are the easiest and quickest ways for us to increase the business we are already doing in these areas with the shortest financial commitment mike and jeff you should be aware though that the corporate commitment to be in the oil business has previously been poor we can candycoat this subject but it is very clear that most of our competitors are more aggressive on the credit and performance risk in emerging markets we have a credit department that have done a poor job if any at all in getting out there visiting with the national oil companies that we have to be able to participate with petrobras pertamina petrolimex sinochem sinopec egpc nnpc if we have any real plans of significantly expanding our physical volumes we are also the worst company in the oil business in putting out a contract that shows we have a commitment to perform our contracts are also drafted with many escape clauses that will be rejected by many endusers who will insist on a greater performance guarantee as we discussed briefly in singapore i think there are several airlines that we could target in the us for physical supply i will tell you now that legal would not accept the consequential damages that the airlines have in their tenders previously i have not gone after this business because i didnt believe we would have the political clout or sponsorship from those in your position to take legal on in such matters please consider this i will fax you a tender offer from japan airlines and lets discuss if we are ready to accept that if we fail we are willing to accept that it could cost us several million dollars that kind of loss i have never experienced and seen it happen on very few occasions but it is something that we have to accept if we want to go after the airline business i will let you know more my thoughts about how we go should try to go forwardthis message was more to highlight how im trying to advance the group along and what are the challanges we face at the moment lastly on that theme we are trying to work with it over here to develop some systems that will make us better suited to do customer business at the moment everybody is working off of individual excell spreadsheets and we are trying to get toward a server based system and options system that would be available to everybody and designed by it people instead of traders i will let you know if we need any help from you on this as intially we do seem to be getting stonewalled by the london it department,06:32:00,No

referencing pges opposition to having comrade davis buy its tx assets powerlines deal davis edison come to terms but pge remains a balky holdout lynda gledhill chronicle sacramento bureau saturdayfebruary two four two zero zero one two zero zero one san francisco chronicle url httpwwwsfgatecomcgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchivetwo zero zero one zero two two four m none eight four two zero six dtl gov gray davis said yesterday he had reached an agreement with southern california edison to put the states financially ailing utilities back on their feet but pacific gas and electric co crucial to any deal remained a holdout the key to the deal is state purchase of utility transmission lines which would help the companies pay off debt they piled up selling electricity for less than it cost them edison will part with its lines for two seven six billion davis said but pge is reluctant to sell and the governor said no deal will work without pge in addition to agreeing to sell its transmission lines edison said it would produce inexpensive power to sell to the state for the next one zero years at a news conference in los angeles davis said the agreement in principle with edison provides value to both sides the utility gets the financial wherewithal to go back into business and keep our lights on we get commensurate value in specific benefits which provide us longterm power at very cheap rates davis framework for righting californias wobbly energy market however hinges on a similar agreement with pge those familiar with the talks involving the utility based in san francisco said discussions are moving very very slowly they are adamantly resistant to selling their transmission facilities said assemblyman fred keeley dboulder creek ron low a spokesman for pge did not comment on keeleys statement but after talks concluded thursday low said the two sides were very far apart on some issues in a statement yesterday pge corporate chairman robert glynn said the discussions were an important milestone in the resolution of californias energy crisis each utilitys issues and opportunities in this crisis are different and we believe that pge has proposed a detailed solution that balances ratepayer and shareholder interests glynn said we are confident that continued discussions can achieve a resolution for our company davis said he made good progress with sempra energy the parent company of san diego gas electric but only some progress with pge davis ruled out a deal that does not include pge i dont believe we can make a satisfactory arrangement without acquiring six zero percent of the transmission lines that in turn requires us to have an arrangement with pge he said the other four zero percent of the grid is owned by municipal utilities keeley said davis is right to insist that pge be part of any deal i think the deal announced is a good first step and will hopefully put pressure on the other companies keeley said critics call deal bailout the purchase price set for edisons transmission lines is two three times the systems book value although critics argue that represents a bailout supporters of the plan say the lines are worth far more than book value for example the cost to replace all the utilities transmission lines a figure that probably would come into play during a possible bankruptcy is estimated at two zero billion if the state pays two three times the book value for all three utilities systems it will pay seven two billion total the agreement with edison follows a framework davis announced last week in exchange for the purchase of the lines edison also agreed to return four two zero million that the utility had sent to its parent company establish conservation easements on two zero zero zero zero acres of watershed for nine nine years and drop all litigation against the state demanding the ability to immediately raise rates edison also agreed to continue to sell the power it produces to the state at cost for another one zero years edison said it still believed that it would have won its lawsuit to recover costs through a rate increase but edison international chairman john bryson said this agreement is far preferable to perhaps years of protracted litigation no rate increase davis continued to insist that the deal would not require a rate increase although he has indicated that the rate increase adopted by the state public utilities commission last month which was supposed to last nine zero days would stay in place davis has been under pressure to meet deadlines he has imposed himself for making progress in the energy crisis which he said were designed to reassure wall street however he also had a personal stake in making yesterdays announcement as he left immediately for a fiveday trip to the east coast davis will spend four days at the national governors association in washington dc and a concurrent meeting of the democratic governors association which he chairs much of his time will be spent reassuring his fellow governors that the crisis is under control as well as meeting with president bush and energy secretary spencer abraham davis on meet the press davis also will use the time to make national media appearances including one on meet the press tomorrow garry south davis political strategist said the appearances will allow davis to address some east coast media accounts of the energy crisis a lot of misconceptions and myths have crept in south said its not helpful to california its not accurate on how the crisis came about and how were trying to solve it after he leaves washington davis will spend a day in new york to meet with wall street analysts yesterday he suggested that he would be asking for their support in californias quest for revenue bonds to help pay for power purchases california will have spent two eight billion on power by next month and its credit ratings have been downgraded by some analysts consumer advocates reacted with skepticism to davis tentative deal with edison nettie hoge executive director of turn the utility reform network said she was displeased with the governors plan because it commits ratepayers to paying off an unidentified portion of utility debt nothing says what the final price tag is she said dealing for power power lines the state would buy southern california edisons transmission lines for about two seven billion two three times their estimated book value to help bail out the financially strapped utility helping out edison parent edison international would pay the utility about four two zero million payback edison would drop its lawsuit seeking higher electricity rates and would to continue to sell the state cheap power for another one zero years the other shoe

power reliant energy inc williams cos and dynegy inc signed an agreement that effectively extended a us district court judges temporary restraining order that had required the generators to supply power to the power grid operators in the meantime the three generators along with duke energy corp and mirant corp have asked the federal energy regulatory commission for an emergency order forcing

 Enron",today friday gary fergus of the brobeck firm and i met with attny harvey morris of the cpuc to negotiate an extension of time for responding to the five subpoenas issued to enron affiliates and portland general we negotiated both an extension for initial responses two weeks plus an opportunity to submit a proposal for a significant reduction in the scope of the request for production of documents this will include a further extension for other documents that are to be produced as well as a reservation of rights to object to the production of other documents we are working in close contact with richard sanders and the epmi legal team in portland on further refining both responses and potential objections however in light of recent communications between the governors office and senior enron officials and the prospect of additional such communications both gary and i wanted to report an unusual aspect of the negotiation with the cpuc at the beginning of the meeting as we were indicating the overall burden of the request the cpuc attorney indicated the extreme pressure the commission was under to get to the bottom of what was happening in the california power markets he also recited that many parties have pledged their cooperation in this investigation to the governor he then proceeded to state that parties who delayed providing responses and raised objections to the requests for production instead of cooperating would be placed on a list of noncooperative parties which would be made available to the governor and legislators and that such parties would have to bear the consequences of such actions this rather explicit threat is in my experience unprecedented at the cpuc i also know the attorney in question well enough to know that he would never invoke political reprisals on his own and was obviously instructed to do so by cpuc pres lynch or her senior staff both gary fergus and i responded that such a threat was both improper and disturbing for a party simply trying to exercise its legitimate rights to adjudicate burdensome discovery requests but there was no attempt to withdraw the threat this comment speaks volumes about the pressure which the cpuc president feels to achieve a politically acceptable result in this matter those senior enron officials in communication with the governor should be made aware of this incident mike day,09:26:00,"Yes

activities tracking and quantifying these activities is important for several obvious reasons to keep upper management apprised of our activities to illustrate the value added and risk managed by our group and to keep each other properly informed so that we can better coordinate our efforts currently these activities take place on an adhoc manual basis which is timeconsuming and inefficient we have a tool already in place to track our activities the project tracking database in lotus notes currently this application is used primarily for rcrs but beginning november one two zero zero one the government affairs group will use this application to track all projects and efforts replacing the need for manual updated spreadsheets and activity quantification firedrills the projects have several features to allow capture of subsets of information including updates risk origination and valuation please note that this will become the only way that well gather this information in other words if you dont enter your data into project tracking we wont know what youre doing all other reports will be eliminated the current lotus notes application will be discontinued as of october three one two zero zero one and will be converted to a webbased product youll find the webbased version as easy or even easier to use than lotus notes additionally conversion to a new database structure will allow for more versatile report extraction before the conversion of the project data from lotus notes to oracle we need to do some data cleanup please expect a call in the next two weeks from elizabeth

september two zero zero zero we have a copy of the contract here in sydney but as the coal was bought under lc and such lc was issued out of london all shipping documentation for this load was forwarded to london to the attention of claire veijou and cornelia luptowitsch london office also issued the invoice to aes on behalf of ecap and this was done by rebecca millerchip or maya beyhem also for your information harrry has prior travel plans that put him in china on the date of the hearing while these could be changed it would be less than desirable will it be necessary for the trader to be the enron rep who appears on behalf of the company or could it ideally be someone from houston or london if needs be simply because this is a long way to go for one appearance john bowman

allegedly had a longterm coal purchase agreement with aes barbers point for delivery to aes in hawaii in brief pt contends that aes breached that agreement through the use of a bogus force majeure letter in order to allow aes to purchase coal from some enron entity at a cheaper spot market price in september or october of this year pts attorneys lord bissell brook out of chicago have served us with a subpoena on enron coal company how they decided that enron coal company was the correct entity is not something i yet know i have been advised that enron coal company is a longdormant subsidiary of enron property although using enron coal companys name throughout the subpoena also references harry riaz rizvi allen childress stuart staley andor john bowman i understand that we probably did do a deal maybe more than one with aes but need to be corrected if i am wrong the subpoena requests that a corporate representative for enron coal company appear with documents on january eight in houston to be deposed about the deal with aes i would like to respond tomorrow by telefax to pts attorneys and advise that enron coal company is the wrong company if all i do is stall them however they can yank the information from us the hard way assuming that we did do the deal in question and eventually get what they want the suit is for about four zero zero zero zero zero zero so it

zero clear to me where the definition of this comes from is it the reference i ntwo zero the box at the top of the relevant annex you are correct if so maybe we two zero should add a line something to the effect of bandwidth units shall mean ds three two zero for this transaction or better yet you might consider a generic referenc etwo zero to the relevant annex that should apply which might let you delete thetwo zero sentence referring to the quality as well we have changed the first senten cetwo zero of the long description to read a us bandwidth transaction with enrontwo zero broadband services lp ebs pursuant to which the seller shall sell an dtwo zero the buyer shall buy the quantity of dsthree bandwidth units submitted bytwo zero counterparty via the website does dso need to be defined somewhere dszero is a term generally known in t hetwo zero industry and is only used in the calculation of the contract price in the two zero long description so we chose not to define it also the definition istwo zero incredibly long complex and technical if you feel strongly about it we two zero can include it but since the long description tells you how many dszero s you two zero should include for calculation purposes we didnt think that it wastwo zero necessary the way the different price definitions fit together has also eluded me two zero there is a formula in the long description and a different formula in the two zero gtc the formula in the long description differs from the formula in the g tctwo zero and in the master agreement in order to accomodate the way that the price two zero is being quoted on enrononline the quote represents the variable component two zero of the unit price in the gtcs and the master agreement in order not to two zero confuse people we decided to include the formula in both the longtwo zero description and the confirmation so that customers could know that the unit two zero price was calculated using the price quoted unless industry tradingtwo zero convention is to the contrary the site makes more intuitive sense when the two zero volume quoted and the price quoted use the same units if the volume istwo zero bandwidth units and the price is a per mile number some counterparties or two zero perhaps more likely their lawyers may be confused the gtc contains the two zero defined term unit price which is in bandwidth unit it seems to me tha ttwo zero if we can quote the price as the unit price and the volume as bandwidthtwo zero units we can ignore the number of dsos per bandwidth unit and the number oftwo zero dso miles for the transaction two zero since they wont change from one product to the next the two sentencestwo zero beginning with any party entering into a transaction could be moved to two zero the gtc since bandwidth is such a new product we really wanted to highlig httwo zero to customers that if they intend to take physical delivery of bandwidthtwo zero which is what we are offering they will need to establish connectivity wi thtwo zero us this is already in the gtc but in an abundance of caution we wanted two zero this fact highlighted especially since connectivity will entail furthertwo zero costs to the customer as well as signing documentation such as colocation two zero agreements licenses etc this can be quite an involved process the term contractual currency is not used int he gtc can thetwo zero parenthetical reference come out the enrononline people may care about two zero this more than i agreed if the numbers of miles and dsos need to stay in the long descriptions i two zero would suggest that you change the references to make it dsos per bandwidth two zero unit both where the number is introduced and in the price formula and tha ttwo zero the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be per dso mile per two zero month it is a quote for one dszero mile of a bandwidth unit for a month two zero since the short description indicates the period for the contract beingtwo zero offered we felt like the quotation was pretty clear we are also a bittwo zero sensitive to using too many defined terms referring to each other in the lo ngtwo zero description from a commercial perspective we are comfortable that thetwo zero language used in the quote and the long description are clear and accurate is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number this needs to betwo zero clear from the long description if a customer wanted to buy five of the octhree two zero bandwidth units quoted for the period from july one july three one the customertwo zero would be entitled to five octhree s for the period from july one july three one i hope two zero that this is responsive to your question we werent entirely clear so for example if you follow all of my suggestions you might end up with two zero something like this a us bandwidth transaction with enron broadband services lp zero one ebszero one eight two zero pursuant to which the seller shall sell and the buyer shall buy the quantit ytwo zero of bandwidth units submitted by counterparty via the website the pricetwo zero shall be as submitted by the counterparty via the website annex aone

duncan mailtoeduncantwo arterhaddencom sent monday september one zero two zero zero one one two five eight pm to mara susan jbennettgmssrcom cc lin meyer douglassenergyattorneycom subject re revised petition and points and authorities i am attaching the joint petition which assumes that a direct access customer joins enron the draft is considerably improved over the draft sent yesterday but it does not take in the comments below these will be reviewed and integrated into the next draft i am very concerned about the exhaustion of remedies problem the jurisdictional statute is puc section one seven six eight a this provision suggests that an aggrieved party must seek a rehearing before the puc before seeking review by the supreme court a request for rehearing must be made within one five days after the puc acts but there is no time within which the puc must act if the puc agreed to stay the order then it seems clear that a rehearing must be sought before applying to the supreme court if the puc refuses the stay request then there is a good argument that one of the exceptions to the exhaustion of remedies would apply this will require that one or all of the petitioners request a stay by the puc douglass indicates that a stay would be unusual and that such requests normally are not made in this case it is probably necessary to circumvent the exhaustion issue ewd jbennett jbennettgmssrcom zero nine one zero zero one one one one nine am sue i have reviewed the petition and associated memorandum a couple of general comments one we make the point throughout page two is the first time that the commissions action retroactive suspension will result in a windfall to the udcs as they will be paid for services provided by enron and other esps it is not clear to me that we can make this argument the commissions order does not indicate that the esps have to pay the udcs the amounts that they have received from their direct access customers for the past two months for energy procurement the commission could just as easily decide that although customers who entered into da contracts after july one are no longer allowed to continue on da they will not go back and undo transactions that have already occurred two in the section of the memorandum discussing why the petition is properly before the court section iv we are discussing why an application for rehearing is unnecessary we state that in this case a rehearing would be superfluous and unnecessary as there are no new legal arguments and no additional evidence to be presented such argument appears to run counter to our contentions that because of the lack of hearing in this proceeding the commissions decision lacks the support it needs or on the flip side denied us the opportunity to put on evidence to show the suspension of direct access was unnecessary three in section vi e of the memorandum arguing that the impairment of contracts ordered by the commission is not reasonable or appropriate we state that the commissions motive is not the announced purpose that its purpose instead is malevolent as illustrated by the rhetoric directed at out of state energy companies i dont think such an argument adds anything and although it maybe true at this stage it probably is not a good idea to assert that the commission is purposely hurting the state to get back at the out of state energy

zero zero one california hearings continue cpuc decision expected this week by will mcnamara director electric industry analysis hearings aimed at giving consumer advocates and utility officials in california the chance to air their views on a looming electricity rate increase are expected to continue through today setting the stage for a decision by regulators that very well may not please everyone officials from southern california edison sce and pacific gas electric pge have asked the california public utilities commission cpuc to grant immediate rate hikes of as much as three zero percent to help offset rising wholesale power prices the cpuc board is expected to announce on jan four how much of a rate hike it will allow and under what terms analysis despite the lull of the holiday week just now completed the spotlight continues to grow more intense over californias energy market both throughout the energy industry and across the mainstream media as we wait with anticipation to hear what the cpuc will decide lets recap some of the issues that will no doubt continue to cause great dissension among the primary players in california as has been well documented pgoand sce are in a massive amount of debt due to uncollected costs they have accrued related to the purchase of power on the wholesale market due to rate freezes still in place both utilities have been unable to charge customers for the dramatic increase in the price of wholesale power which has placed them both on the brink of bankruptcy from several conversations with my contacts in california heres my understanding of where the negotiations currently stand the cpuc already has agreed in theory to a rate increase but the sticking point is the specific amount of that increase reportedly the cpuc and gov gray davis proposed a one five percent rate hike to the two utilities in sharp contrast pgomaintains that it needs to increase rates by as much as four zero percent and sce says that it wants an increase of three zero percent or seven six percent over two years in fact pgoalready began notifying customers last week that it wants to boost their electric bills by that specific amount both utilities continue to argue that even if their proposed rate increases are accepted they still may not be enough to cover wholesale costs which are projected to rise through two zero zero three see my issuealert from dec two nine in addition pgoand sce also claim that their financial solvency still will not be guaranteed even if their rate increase proposals are accepted and bankruptcy will be very likely if the cpuc only allows them to increase rates by one five percent over the last few weeks pressure was put on the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to step in and solve the problem however ferc issued its own order in early december that mainly focused on mechanisms to keep power generators active in the state and did not adequately address the core issues of high wholesale prices and rate freezes due to the lukewarm response that fercs order received it has been generally concluded that the cpuc and gov davis alone will have to solve the california energy crisis it is important to not overlook or discount the role that consumer advocates are playing in the negotiations harvey rosenfield a longtime critic of the states utilities who led the failed attempt to overturn deregulation in california in one nine nine eight remains very vocal that the people of california should not have to pay one more penny to bail out the utilities for the mistakes they made consumer groups led by rosenfield and ralph nader continue to put enormous pressure on gov davis a democrat to keep any rate increase given to the utilities to a minimum in fact last week nader stated that davis political future hangs by a kilowatt hour and that any decisions made in california will reverberate all over the country in essence consumer groups believe that utilities share the bulk of responsibility for the current mess in the state as they played a large role in californias one nine nine six restructuring legislation if mistakes were made in that legislation consumer groups say the utilities and not utility customers should be made to pay the price speculation is growing that on jan four the cpuc will approve an increase for extra costs that will be applied in increments over the course of two zero zero one resulting in an ultimate rate increase that is somewhere in the range of one five percent to three zero percent or more this in effect will offer a compromise to both sides the utilities will receive a rate increase closer to what they claim is necessary and utility customers will not get slapped with an immediate allatonce increase in their electricity bills however the cpuc probably will not approve any back billing that the utilities have also demanded both pgoand sce have claimed that their stranded costs were probably paid off months ago meaning that the rate freeze still in place for both utilities should have been lifted as a result that theory being accurate both companies want to bill their customers retroactively to the date that the rate freeze should have been lifted which on its own could amount to several billions of dollars under the current arrangement the rate freeze is scheduled to stay in effect until march two zero zero two unless lifted by the cpuc meanwhile the question about the financial solvency of both pgoand sce continues to loom sces parent edison international announced that it has eliminated its fourthquarter dividend and reduced its work force by four zero zero jobs because of financial problems related to sce in a statement last week pgoceo gordon smith acknowledged that pgohas virtually exhausted its financial resources because it has borrowed on average one million per hour to pay for power that it is obligated to provide to california consumers both utilities have argued that the real cause of the problem in the state is the generators who unjustifiably continue to charge exorbitant rates for power on the wholesale market there may be some validity to this theory as power generators who operate in california know that the states ious have essentially been stripped of their own ability to generate power and thus are heavily dependent on power bought on the wholesale market this has given an enormous amount of market power to the generators and allowed them to charge rates that are not reflective of their own costs some reports indicate that generators are charging as much as three zero times what it costs them to generate power yet without a cap on wholesale rates generators remain able to charge whatever price the market will bear due to these high costs some power generators have begun refusing to sell power to the california ious out of fear that the utilities will not be able to pay their bills in an ironic twist the same companies that have expressed concern about selling power to pgoand sce actually own and control the plants that were divested by the two utilities as part of their agreements in the states restructuring plan thus companies outside of and inside california that own california plants are refusing to sell power back into the state power produced at plants that were once owned by pgoand sce as a result pgowent on record last week saying that it may not have enough power to serve customers in february unless additional rulings come from the cpuc pgosays that it has enough power to supply customers through january but that one five to two zero suppliers have demanded payment up front before selling natural gas to the utility in february due to its current debt situation pgoclaims that it cannot make any payments up front and thus may not be able to buy natural gas to serve its customers these issues have formed the landscape across which negotiations still rage on in california much pressure is now being placed on the cpuc to formulate an endall solution to the states problems one that can appease all the dissenting stakeholders yet much like fercs order which was criticized for not going far enough the cpuc is particularly challenged to make decisions that can once and for all solve the states structural problems as enrons kenneth lay said a few months ago the cpuc must

jones company inc washington dow jones the us federal energy regulatory commission issued an order late thursday requiring four nine electricity providers to file information regarding contracts they have entered into with the california department of water resources the information due by the close of business monday is being compiled on behalf of the house government reform committee which held hearings in california this week as part of its oversight investigation into the states electricitysupply crisis rep dan burton rind the committees chairman requested the information from ferc to determine whether the commissions order dec one five designed to move the state away from reliance on volatile spot markets for power supplies and into lowercost longterm contracts has been effective the state water department has been purchasing power for months on behalf of the states two financially troubled utilities spending more than four billion at a rate of five zero million daily edison international unit southern california edison eix and pge corp unit pacific gas electric co have amassed more than one three billion in liabilities because stateregulated retail rates dont allow them to pass through highcost wholesale power purchases pge filed for chapter one one bankruptcy protection on behalf of its utility unit a week ago monday edison entered into an agreement to sell the state its transmission lines in a bid to restore financial solvency fercs order thursday requests information from four nine power suppliers on both short and longterm contracts they may have entered into with the department since dec one five ferc said it will treat the information as confidential unless the supplier states otherwise one democratic official in washington suggested the house panel is engaged in a partisan bashing effort targeting california gov gray davis who has widely been touted as a presidential prospect for the two zero zero four election davis spokesman steven maviglio supported the officials assessment what a shock dan burton is at it again maviglio said facetiously of burton who derived a reputation as a partisan foe of former us president bill clinton with his many investigations into clinton and his administration the bottom line is theyre aiding and abetting the generators maviglio said of burtons committee the governors spokesman also questioned whether

from californias two major utilities and two of its smaller power generators were in the hot seat in san jose on wednesday fielding questions from federal lawmakers about their role in the states power crisis on day two of a threeday swing through california three republican members of a us house subcommittee on energy policy and three local democratic representatives heard testimony from utility officials and from the chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission the energy crisis is expected to bring rolling blackouts to california through the summer months and energy officials warned on wednesday that the high prices consumers face here undoubtedly will spill over into neighboring states if ferc doesnt cap prices now but ferc chairman curt l hebert jr reiterated what he said tuesday at a western energy summit in boise he does not support price caps on electricity in california or any of the western states the energy is going to go where the caps are not and nine out of one one western state governors have said they dont want price caps in their states hebert said a cap sends us in the wrong direction instead he said by may one ferc will unveil a plan to monitor energy prices and in some cases might mitigate the price of energy sold on californias more expensive spot markets he wouldnt elaborate but made it clear those adjustments would not include price caps government reform committee chairman dan burton of indiana opened the hearing by saying the committees mission was not to point fingers we wanted to see if there were ways the federal government and the state government could work together to get past this crisis at one point early in the hearing demonstrators attempted to address the lawmakers they were ushered out of the room by security personnel burton was joined by republican representatives doug ose of woodland and steve horn of lakewood also participating in the hearings were democratic representatives zoe lofgren and michael honda of san jose and barbara lee of oakland the democrats pushed strongly for ferc to consider price caps we need to gain control of this outofcontrol market and gain control of the price gouging lofgren said honda concurred we believe that ferc has a responsibility and theyve even said that rates are unjust and unreasonable we need shortterm caps it was clear that burton doesnt believe that price caps are the answer in fact on several occasions he suggested that capping energy prices might result in even more blackouts as summer approaches lee suggested that some people believe the only way out of the crisis is some form of reregulation but dede hapner vice president of regulatory relations for pge said she wasnt sure that was the answer we still think a correctly structured market could work its certainly working in other states hapner said in retrospect the way the deregulation market was structured was designed to fail today the hearings move to san diego

power merchants have been touting energy as cheap as five zero per megawatthour in contracts spread over one to five years that would seem to offer big savings over the average power exchange electricity price so far this month of one two two per megawatthour and the one six six average for augustdramatic spikes upward from the four zero average of august one nine nine nine why then have no deals been cut edison and sdge say that the public utilities commissions right of review would create huge potential liabilities for their shareholders if wholesale electricity prices were to fall the risk is that prices on the power exchange could drop significantly one eight to two four months from now when added generation capacity coming online in california should ease shortages that could leave utilities paying more under contracts than on the open market the puc could look at the transactions find them to be imprudent say the difference between the contract price and power exchange price was the cost of our actions and then try to recover the difference from shareholders said kevin cini southern california edisons manager of energy supply and marketing the puc could possibly take such action any time the contract price turns out to be more than a five safe harbor band above the average power exchange wholesale price over the life of the contract we think the safe harbor should be two zero cini said a source at the pucsome of whose members have been against bilateral contracts on grounds they distort the workings of the power exchangesaid the utilities want a blank check to make deals and bypass the commissions mandated oversight role in setting retail electricity rates the utilities dont want any constraints on what they can do said a puc administrative source who asked not to be identified they dont want the puc to take a retroactive review and say this was unreasonable and disallow some costs nor do they want preapproval and be subjected to review industry observers say that the pucs right to review all contracts longer than two years hamstrings the utilities ability to hedge their risks in the volatile state energy market the utilities can judge the risks what we need is the puc to allow the utilities to enter into these deals without the second chance of looking at them said greg blue senior director of dynegy a houstonbased power merchant that owns several power plants in southern california regulators and consumer advocates meanwhile are concerned that allowing the utilities to sign contracts for supply represents a merchant role they relinquished under deregulation mike florio of the utility reform network a san franciscobased consumer watchdog said the utilities could someday lose some of their retail customer base leaving the remaining customers to pay contracts costing more than what was available on the spot market stanford professor blake johnson believes the california wholesale market will one day settle out as a mixture of shortterm contracts on the power exchange and longterm bilateral deals until then he said he can see the risks on both sides of the issue when the house is on fire he said its not the right time to buy the insurance policy,05:02:00,"Yes

the renewable energy power desk has recently closed a significant deal with andrews air force base and is working with other enron businesses to build a network to transact more deals and to attract

the eve of their release the ferc commissioners could impose new price caps or order an overhaul of the california power exchange and the independent system operator the state agencies that conduct daily auctions for electricity the commissioners may ask the state to undertake new initiatives to foster more competition in a retail power market still dominated by the three big investorowned utilities but an indictment of power generation companieswhich some in the state accuse of gaming or manipulating the system to wield unfair market power and wringing excessive profits from customersis unlikely according to published reports and state industry principals and government officials the ferc commissioners are said to blame market deficiencies and defects in california for a supplydemand imbalance that sent wholesale electricity prices skyrocketing in july to an average of one two nine cents a kilowatthour more than triple the july one nine nine nine average of three nine cents a typical residential customer of san diego gas electric the first state utility to fully deregulate saw his or her bills triple before state legislators stepped in to cap retail rates in august just as worrisome to many observers is that wholesale electricity rates remain skyhigh today even after the end of peak summer power demand wholesale rates in october averaged about one zero cents a

prominent california politicians could be affected by what ferc does us energy secretary bill richardson is coming out from washington to hold a news conference with gov gray davis in sacramento this morning to announce new unspecified initiatives to address californias electricity problems the davis administration has gone on record demanding that ferc which oversees the transmission and wholesale selling of electricity around the country to step in and discharge its legal duty to restore just and fair electricity rates in california the ballooning of electricity rates in san diego

she is as much in suspense as anyone but we are expecting a substantial order that would move the ball forward on repairing the wholesale market in california consumer advocates and the states major utilities would like to see ferc impose some sort of wholesale price controlseven gut the power exchange and the independent system operator because they are clearly not working as intended we expect some radical surgery said doug kline spokesman for sempra energy the parent of san diego gas electric some consumer groups would like to see ferc declare the wholesale rates collected by generators unjust and unreasonable legal code words that would open the gates to actions by the puc or the legislature to force the power companies to disgorge or refund excessive profit such an action which would lead to litigation by the power companies is considered unlikely business interests including the power generators that have reaped enormous profit from the dysfunctional market are arguing to let freemarket forces prevail because restrictive price caps would abort the markets evolution and possibly stifle construction of new power plants which offer the best longterm solution to the states predicament we expect that the ferc will find that the high prices of this past summer are a result of supplyanddemand imbalance and market design defects on the retail and wholesale side but that the market participants have been playing within the rules and that there has been no manipulation or gaming said brent bailey general counsel of duke energy north america of houston a major generation player in the california market duke and others also strenuously oppose a solution proposed by the states municipal utilities notably the los angeles department of water and power that the industry in essence be reregulated by imposing a system of costbased rate controls similar to how electricity rates were set before deregulation such a move would lead to lawsuits filed by duke and other power merchants alleging confiscatory actions by the state nullifying the value of hundreds of millions of dollars they have invested in california power plants bailey favors temporary price caps until the market regains its balance as well as new tweaking of the power market to stir up competition los angeles dwp general manager s david freeman who has led calls for temporary imposition of costbased

through the twentyfifth fueled withdrawals from storage that cera estimates will average approximately eight five billion cubic feet bcf per day for the month near the alltime record for november set in one nine nine five this is approximately five zero bcf per day higher than the previously expected withdrawal rate under normal weather conditions the result is that storage inventories as of the end of the month are about five zero zero bcf below the yearearlier level and are on track to dip well into record low territory by the end of the winter see table one for december normal weather would result in storage withdrawals of one seven zero bcf per day on average for the month at that rate storage inventories would fall below two zero trillion cubic feet tcf by the end of the year the first time that has ever occurred by the end of march cera expects working inventories to be reduced to six zero six bcf in the united states compared with the previous record low of seven five eight bcf this weather and high withdrawal rates have moved prices higher within the wide and volatile range between residual fuel oil and distillate with gas prices moving farther above those of resid four seven five to five zero zero and closer to the price of distillate fuel oil approximately seven zero zero strength in the oil market has kept the residdistillate range high but should gas test either boundary of this range the price of either distillate or resid would move as well under normal weather cera now expects december prices to average six two five at the henry hub a higher level within this range reflective of reduced storage inventories although prices have abated somewhat in recent days and will continue to rise and fall with weather and weather forecasts fundamentals now are so tight that a return to cold weather would quickly drive prices back above six five zero and potentially above seven zero zero at the henry hub it is only at that level or above that any significant

terminate three eight million megadeal in a stunning announcement late yesterday el paso natural gas said it had reached a mutual agreement with enron north america corp to terminate the three eight million negotiated megadeal for one two bcfd of capacity that the marketer had entered into in december the negotiated arrangement covers three separate capacity agreements the decision to release enron from the three capacity agreements was somewhat puzzling given that enron last week had asked to be let out of only one contract the famed block ii agreement six one four mmcfd due to the restrictions that ferc had placed on the delivery rights of the capacity in a jan two seven letter enron notified el paso of its intent to exit the block ii contract but the letter didnt indicate that it wanted to terminate the blocks i and iii contracts see daily gpi feb three they asked for it to be released and we agreed to it it was a mutual agreement said el paso spokesman mel scott the capacity agreements will be terminated on jan three one afterward el paso said it will hold open season from feb seven to feb one four for the capacity it is unfortunate that the recent ferc order modified the capacity rights in a way that will not allow the capacity to serve the purpose that enron north america originally intended when they outbid the prearranged transactions in the interest of fairness and good customer relations we have agreed to release them from the contracts said john w somerhalder ii president of el paso energys pipeline group el paso natural gas has asked ferc to reconsider the midjanuary order that essentially has reduced the commercial value of the block ii firm transportation capacity that enron had agreed to acquire with the collapse of its contract deal with enron it couldnt be immediately determined whether el paso will continue to pursue rehearing el paso is seeking rehearing after being rebuffed by ferc in its request to stay the provision in the order restricting delivery rights of block ii capacity the pipeline is seeking a reversal of a decision in which ferc said el pasos one nine nine six turnedback capacity settlement bars el paso from marketing block ii capacity on a primary basis to any delivery point other than the one at pacific gas electrictopock az that ruling stripped the block ii capacity of primary delivery access to the southern california gastopock delivery point which is the most soughtafter by shippers of san juan basin gas it was a major blow to el paso and enron which had contracted for the block ii capacity in december on the condition that it would have primary delivery access to the southern california market without a favorable decision on rehearing the result may well be a diminution of the value of block ii capacity el paso told ferc without question enron as a new shipper on the capacity and future holders of that capacity will suffer a disadvantage in the market el paso contends the commissions ruling if unchanged would thwart the intent of the one nine nine six settlement which called for the pipeline and its customers to share the risks of unsubscribed capacity on el pasos system and for el paso to share a portion of the revenues it received from remarketing the capacity an essential element in el pasos ability to maximize the revenues it agreed to share with its firm customers was the ability to market the six one four mmcfd of block ii capacity on a primary basis to delivery points other than pgetopock the pipeline noted stripping el paso of deliverypoint flexibility for block ii capacity will have a serious adverse impact on its ability to generate the maximum possible revenues for its capacity and thereby recover the costs it and its customers would otherwise have to absorb el paso further said the commissions decision was at odds with a one nine nine eight order addressing whether the pipeline could remarket capacity turned back by pge to the socaltopock delivery point on a primary basis since the one nine nine six settlement was silent on whether el paso could remarket the capacity to delivery points other than pgetopock the commission reasoned the settlement didnt preclude el paso from selling the capacity at socaltopock that ruling established the proper interpretation of the one nine nine six settlement now the commission has reinterpreted that same provision in a manner that is completely contrary to its previous ruling the commission provides no explanation as to how these two rulings can be reconciled or alternatively why it has changed its mind el paso said it was also seeking rehearing because it cannot find any evidence in the midjanuary order that the commission even read much less considered its response as to the proper interpretation of theone nine nine six settlement,10:14:00,No

preference fo r stakeholder vs independent board as a basic principle i believe that t he key issue is independence energy marketing generation ownership etc i have given each of these a grade from one one zero based on my preference forprofit transcograde one zero the best form of governance is the forprofi t transco it is governed by a independent corporate board and regulated b y ferc independence is a fact of corporate structure and regulatory restr iction the transco can take on delivery risk building new facilities as necessary to meet customer demand the transco is prohibited from taking a ny long term position in the energy market and it is compensated only by s ystem through flow total load served and energy wheeled unfortunately i think the likelihood of transcos forming is remote the biggest obstacle is the difficulty of getting around the tax problems the llpllc structur es skirts the tax problem but it also results in converting a sizable inve stment in to a passive investment with control by a minority owner i thin k the only way to get transcos in the short run is for there to be a short window two three years when transmission owners have the ability to sell assets to a company combining assets without taxes those missing the window wo uld have to pay taxes on a presale merger transactions as they do now th is would compel owners to determine if they want to be transmission owners and spin off could occur federal assets tva bpa wapa are unlikely to be spun off for some time if ever forprofitgridcograde eight five i see this as a slight variant from an iso fo rm like the transco independence arises from corporate structure and re gulatory restriction on activities however i dont think it can take on much risk for delivery or congestion cost certainty the gridco will be th inly capitalized in comparison to the cost of the transmission system or th e value of energy transmitted as a result its efficiency over the notfor profit iso is some share of operational benefits notforprofit iso with independent boardgrade eight zero this is actually ve ry close tie with the forprofit gridco the best form i have seen is tha t proposed for rto west the members of the iso the customers and stakeho lders select a nominating committee representing each class of members t he nominating committee selects a search firm to proposed candidates who me et the conflict of interest standard the nominating committee elects dire ctors from the slate of candidates every member of the nominating committ ee votes on every director a majority of the committee must agree to ever y director selected directors must stand for reelection every three years with staggered terms for the directors the board of directors is subjec t to open meeting requirements except for personnel matters an advisory c ommittee is formed of the members but it is open to participation by all parties the advisory committee meets periodically by itself and with the board however any party may submit its views to the board on any matter the advisory committee serves as a forum for discussion but it is not a g ate keeper determining what the board should be told there is no voting c lass structure for the advisory committee because it does not make recommen dations as a group individual groups submit their views directly to the b oard notforprofit iso with stakeholder boardgrade five this is a poor option far below the independent board the first caiso board showed it self to be largely paralyzed by the inability of the various stakeholders to vote for anything that would harm anyone as a result in my view they never r eally enforced the file tariff eg forming new zones when it was clearly needed however two worse forms exist notforprofit iso with state appointed boardgrade two one this is an even poorer outcome since state politics will prevent the iso from ever acting independently this kind of board will serve at the governors pleasure it will discriminate in the interests of a single state even if the board were appointed by multiple governors it would have no incentive to provid e an efficient market to include multiple states an interstate compact i s needed with congressional approval similar organizations northwest pow er planning council colorado river commission port authority of new york and new jersey etc have slow reaction times and are political driven notforprofit transcograde two zero lacking an efficiency target imposed by a profit goal a notforprofit transco would tend to maximize the benefit s for its own staff the management will want to extend the size of the en terprise to justify salaries and the staff will have few reasons to care ab out customer service this is the dmv this kind of agency will tend towa rd condescending paternalistic approaches to its services ie imposing the values of the staff on the response to any request for

quotes energy experts belie davis rosy prediction summer expected to be crunch time greg lucas sacramento bureau chief wednesdayfebruary two eight two zero zero one sacramento gov gray davis optimistic assessment that california may be on the back side of its energy crisis flies in the face of what many energy companies and other experts predict californias real test will come this summer when electricity usage sharply increases and unless everything breaks the way davis hopes predictions are that large chunks of the state will be in the dark were not on the back side of this crisis this problem is far far bigger than the governor is suggesting said gary ackerman executive director for the western power trading forum in menlo park to characterize the problem that way shows a recklessness that feeds on the popular notion we dont have an energy crisis we do we have a very serious one thats going to hit us as temperatures and loads go up ackerman said the democratic governors comments were made monday in washington dc during an east coast visit aimed at getting washington and wall street support for his energy plan he admitted more hard work is needed but said the state is on the back side of the crisis because lawmakers have passed bills needed to help lower electricity prices does that mean were home free davis asked yesterday no but he again repeated that the state is on the back side of the crisis that is contrary to predictions by the independent system operator which oversees the states power market on any given day in june the iso estimates the state will fall six eight one five megawatts short of demand that would put nearly seven million homes in the dark if it happens in july the expected shortage is four six eight five megawatts in august its five two nine seven megawatts thats if california has a normal summer if its hotter than normal the shortage grows the isos estimates tend to be conservative and do not include davis conservation goal but even if a one zero percent reduction were achieved in june that would save roughly five zero zero zero megawatts the state would still be short one eight zero zero megawatts and there are other variables depending on the snowpack and reservoir levels hydroelectric plants may not be able to run at full bore which would also worsen the situation that is something the governor cannot spin his way out of said sen tom mcclintock rnorthridge davis said a combination of new power plants and energy conservation will help the state get through this summer the clock is running the iso predicts shortages of three zero three zero megawatts in may just two months away the real electricity crisis is going to be this summer and i dont think weve made enough progress there said severin borenstein director of the university of california energy institute california wont be able to build its way out of the energy crisis by quickly approving and building new power plants borenstein said the isos demand estimates already factor in the new power plants set to come online this summer unless we have a very mild summer and have lots of rainfall between then and now borenstein said we are going to face some serious shortages like davis borenstein says california needs to do more to conserve energy unlike davis he favors raising prices on big power consumers to give them an incentive to cut back but the democratic governor may be sending californians a mixed message by telling them the worst is over he could undercut his plan by making people believe more conservation is unnecessary excluding what lies ahead there are also plenty of energy issues left unresolved right now although davis has reached a tentative deal with southern california edison on purchasing its share of the states transmission system for two seven billion no such deal exists with either pacific gas electric or san diego gas electric some alternative energy producers like cogeneration plants are shutting down because the cashpoor utilities havent paid them for several months no cash means no fuel to run the turbines that make the juice generators like duke energy and reliant energy arent convinced the crisis has passed for starters both companies are owed in excess of seven zero zero million for electricity bought by pge and edison but never paid for there are a lot of issues still out there such as how much power your state will require this summer whether there is enough generation on the ground or available commercially to handle the load if there is a significant spike in demand said richard wheatley a reliant spokesman harvey rosenfield head of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights has a slightly different take on whether the worst is over weve said all along its a crisis inspired by the greed of the utilities and the energy companies rosenfield said now that taxpayers are paying one billion every three weeks to buy electricity and the ratepayers are going to pay between one three billion and two zero billion the companies are happy and the crisis is over what more could they want email greg lucas at glucassfchroniclecom

contract must contain an explicit cap on the number of shares to betwo zero delivered in a net share settlement this cap must exist even if the contra cttwo zero terminates when the stock price reaches a stated price trigger the need f ortwo zero a cap was determined to be critical in determining whether a company hadtwo zero sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle the contract at contract inception and on an ongoing basis the company must havetwo zero sufficient authorized but unissued shares available to settle the contract two zero considering all other claims on authorized shares for stock optionstwo zero convertibles and other transactions that may require the issuance of stock two zero this requirement was deemed critical as the ability to have a request for two zero additional authorized shares approved by the shareholders was deemed outsid etwo zero of the control of the company in this context the company is defined as two zero the companys management rather than its management and shareholders there is no requirement in the contract to post collateral at any point in two zero the contract or for any reason there are no required cash payments to the counterparty trueups if the n ettwo zero shares initially delivered are insufficient to provide the counterparty wit htwo zero full satisfaction of the amount due however trueups may be included in t hetwo zero contract if the company only not the counterparty can choose whether to two zero satisfy the trueup in shares or cash and the trueup is subject to thetwo zero explicit cap discussed in item two there is no economic penalty in the contract for net share settlement that two zero would economically compel the company to settle in net cash the right to two zero increase the number of shares delivered based on the fair value differentia ltwo zero between registered shares and unregistered shares was not deemed to be atwo zero penalty there are no provisions in the contract that would indicate the counterpart ytwo zero had creditor rights or would otherwise contravene the objective of thistwo zero model that the counterpartyzero one s rights would rank no higher than those of atwo zero common shareholder subject to future eitf discussions it may be possible two zero to meet this criterion by having a legal letter addressing the issue or a two zero specific statement of this concept in the contract related issues there was also discussion of the provisions relating to termination andtwo zero settlement in the event of a merger or change in control there was general two zero support for a position that as long as the counterparty received the same two zero choice of compensation as other shareholders for example stock for stock two zero stock and cash for stock cash for stock the fact that the counterparty two zero might receive cash in such circumstances would not preclude equity treatmen ttwo zero for the contract similarly in the event of nationalization or liquidation a net cashtwo zero settlement of the same type afforded a common shareholder would not preclud etwo zero equity treatment for the contract in addition counterparty rights that did not exceed rights of commontwo zero shareholders should be acceptable for example rights to sue for damages i ntwo zero the event of misrepresentations or a breach of warrranties or if a company two zero simply refused to perform under the contract as long as a common sharehold ertwo zero would also have those rights with respect to events that would cause a contract that was compliant with two zero the model at inception to later become noncompliant for example because a ntwo zero acquisition consumed enough authorized shares that otherwise were needed to two zero satisfy the contract the eitf concluded that at the time the contract is two zero no longer compliant the fair value of the contract should be transferred two zero from equity to an asset or liability at fair value with prospective changes two zero in fair value reported currently in earnings there would be no immediate two zero earnings effect at the time of this transfer further if at a later date sufficient shares were authorized to againtwo zero satisfy the contract the carrying amount of the contract that is its fai rtwo zero value would be transferred back to equity and the contract treated as equi tytwo zero prospectively to the extent the contract continues to comply with the model two zero the company would not be permitted to reverse the gains and losses in fair two zero value recognized in earnings during the period the contract was treated as antwo zero asset or liability transition the eitf tentatively concluded that all contracts entered into after the da tetwo zero of a final consensus will have to comply with the model at contract incepti ontwo zero to achieve equity treatment the goal is to reach a final consensus at the two zero september two zero zero zero eitf

Issues with Pre-Schedule and Path Confirmation,please see my comments in blue what follows are known issues with the preschedule workspace and path confirmation report preschedule workspace generating transmission confirmation records appears not to be working for second or third transmissions the record makes a transmission line for the transmission provider but does not insert the transtwo name or transtwo oasis data into the path it appears that saving does not always work getting list index out of bounds errors when attempting to run the build route question can we just route the month long bookouts on the first with the designation of month in the sched term like we can now it will cut down on the daily routing add if possible error checking for missing supply or market deal numbers why would this not be possible so much is driven by the deal number that to omit it would be a problem and missing physical or nonphysical designation if nothing is specified in the phys column nonphysical will be assume questoin so far we have done nothing for the daily summary is this something that can wait or do we need to get it done for this release daily summary is a current function creating data that i use to report our volumes to our traders belden and lavorato this must be done for production as they ask me for this often yesterday i found another problem if i retype a hour range in the sched hour cell in psw it converts it to date format and i get an invalid variant type conversion error nothing i did short of deleting the cells making the changes in ms excel and repasting them worked path confirmation report need to enable text wrapping for path field the path field is the most important field of which to see all data right now some paths are wrapped and some arent can we add a masterdetail setup when soring by tag provide a list of tags and show data for selected tag sorting by global id this needs to be able to be done in the upper sort area this is unclear what is meant by the upper sort area the area where we can drag and shuffle sort criteria up above the regular line view not able to see the entire path in the expanded view also delivery points are not showing up yesterday i found that if a delivery point on the sheet is not exactly what enpower has ie midway instead of midwaypsc the expanded view just gets rid of it completely perhaps this should be an errorchecking point find out to what the greyed out name in the expanded view is related just getting rid of that unrelated name is enough extend the size limit of the path we need to find out if the existing data was blown away purposefully or if this was accidental in the last release only the data from six two three was preserved from the previous version the porpod fields are still the same we would like the delivery point selection to mimic the same functionality as the delivery point selection we see in scheduling pulling up the proper date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the system we need to make sure that the selection process does not get incrementally slower with each additional day of data that is added for some reason a gobal id is showing up in the expanded view in lines where there is not a global id provided it is always the same one ciso_epmi_five zero zero one path cuts need to filter region list for cuts by trading desk east or west allow hour ranges in the hour field specifically in he zero zero zero zero military format eg zero two zero zero zero four zero zero or one zero zero zero one four zero zero must allow string values to be stored in the annuity field transmission should be optional make it easier to show all cuts for a path allow incremental hours to a cut as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time a new tag might have to be made each hour of the cut im not quite sure what you are asking for can you give a little more detail if i create a cut for a single hour i would like to show additional hours in the same cut at a later time kind of an addon to the original cut this application will go through a final evaluation by the real time departments and i expect that they will need features that i have not been able to anticipate my plan is to get as many of their needs met as possible before turning testing over to them they are aware of this and the time table that we all are trying to meet i will also help them with their testing to articulate their needs to you in the most efficient way possible in the cut view the region is still the cumbersome drop down list this needs to be a forced choice option like the hourahead vs realtime selection the choices for the west are wsccs wsccn rockies northwest california corry will be able to provide his region choices the path that has been cut needs to be able to pull up the cut note without hunting for it in the cut path view the suggestion of a go to cut button was made in an earlier

los angeles ca which two receivers should i start this weekend out of todd pinkston bill schroeder chris carter te rry glenn and james mcknight who would you recommend starting out of duce staley stephen davis ron dayne kevan barlow and jason brookins answe r gg as long as schroeder ankle is healthy hes a must start agai nst a minnesota defense that allowed charlie batch to throw for three four five yards a nd three touchdowns last weekend miami has a bye so mcknight is obviously not an option pinkston and glenn both have good matchups but wed have t o go with carter in this case this season has been very unpredictable so going with your most established player in this case is the best move to a nswer your second question wed recommend davis against a vulnerable carol ina defense and dayne against philadelphia its tough to choose davis but barlow has a bye and both staley and brookins will be splitting carries at best so our hands are tied zero nine question jeff smith tampa fl i have jeff garcia who has a bye th is week i have the option of starting jim miller or picking up chris weink e what do you recommend answer gg miller has been very inconsist ent from a fantasy perspective so wed have to side with weinke hell be facing a washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like muhsin muhammad donald hayes and wesley walls weinke could have a b ig game zero nine question scott buzby newark de who should i start this week shan non sharpe or bubba franks also is it time to drop james thrash kevin j ohnson laveranues coles todd pinkston and joe jurevicius are all still av ailable answer gg franks has been brett favres favorite target i n the red zone but sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league sha rpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot and we hi ghly doubt that franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game as far as thrash goes we feel hes just not good enough to be facing noone cornerbacks on a weekly basis so his numbers will be inconsistent at best your best bet is to drop him and go after an other no one caliber wideout like johnson who could emerge as a reliable fa ntasy player zero nine tip of the week phil brown st louis mo when will people start giving priest holmes the credit he deserves he is the best offensive optio n the chiefs have and he even has more rushing yards than marshall faulk a fter five weeks with dick vermeil calling the shots in kansas city holmes will continue to be a productive player all season zero nine

information that i have on comparable worth which is what the proposed paycheck fairness act introduced in both the senate sseven seven and the house hr seven eight one is all about i have also noticed another act introduced in the senate seight entitled enhancing economic security for americas working families act that has buried in it the same wording as the paycheck fairness act i dont know how this happensim sure it is intended seight also requests a minimum wage increase and something on family care but it didnt show when i printed the document sseven seven hr seven eight one and seight can be located at httpthomaslocgov enter the bill number without the periods ie sseven hrseven eight one seight and click search to the best of my knowledge and drawing from all i have read the paycheck fairness act is responding to the supposed wage gap between the sexes there has been much press over the last few years about the huge gap that exists in pay between men and women the government through the eeoc and the ofccp use this gap to further justify why they exist to stamp out discrimination these agencies would like for us to believe that the gap is the result of discrimination and ignore other factors such as hours of work experience and tenure years and type of education interrupted careers especially for women during their childbearing years and industry and occupationall of which differ considerably between men and women the government tells us that women earn on an average two five percent less than their male counterparts but i have read research where once all the factors are looked at there is only about six percent gap that can not be explained i will send you the article supporting this the are two sections that concern me the most in sseven seven and hr seven eight one sec eight collection of pay information by the equal employment opportunity commission which states section seven zero nine of the civil rights act of one nine six four four three usc two zero zero zero eeight is amended by adding at the end the following f one not later than one eight months after the date of enactment of this subsection the commission shall a complete a survey of the data that is currently available to the federal government relating to employee pay information for use in the enforcement of federal laws prohibiting pay discrimination andin consultation with other relevant federal agencies identify additional data collections that will enhance the enforcement of such laws and b based on the results of the survey and consultations under subparagraph a make rules to provide for the collection of pay information from employers as described by the sex race and national origin of employees im sure the other relevant federal agencies will include the ofccp who we know have been using the comparable worth methodology the dubray method to force federal contractors into making large salary adjustments for women and minorities in their glass ceiling audits even though there is no legal basis to analyze compensation this way many companies have given in to their strong arm tactics and paid obscene amounts in back pay and equity pay just to get the ofccp to go away we are one of the few companies that have refused to agree with them which has resulted in our one nine nine seven glass ceiling audit being turned over to the department of labors solicitors office also in sec three enhanced enforcement of equal pay requirements the secretary of labor can establish voluntary guidelines to rate different jobs based on criteria such as educational requirements skill requirements independence working conditions and responsibility market considerations are not identified as criteria that the secretary may consider or include moreover the secretary would have the authority to issue regulations to implement the guidelines employers would be encouraged to compare the wages paid to similarly rated jobs and identify pay disparities between those occupations dominated by women and those dominated by men this would require enron to implement a compensation system to accurately monitor the value we place on different jobs this would be an administrative nightmare the society for human resources management shrm has published some talking points about the paycheck fairness act as below shrm strongly supports the equal pay act and title vii of the civil rights act of one nine six four title vii that prohibit genderbased wage discrimination however shrm opposes s seven seven and hr seven eight one the paycheck fairness act which would expand remedies under the equal pay act of one nine six three to include unlimited punitive and compensatory damages the paycheck fairness act is designed to advance the concept of comparable worth through dol rulemaking comparable worthrelated legislation advances the notion of the government rather than the private market ultimately determining wages s seven seven and hr seven eight one would lead to unnecessary litigation and backlogs in the courts congress rejected the theory of comparable worth during the equal pay act debate moreover federal courts have rejected comparable worth as a legal theory under the equal pay act title vii of the civil rights act already provides significant remedies for sex discrimination in employment including any claim that equal pay is being denied based on gender these remedies include punitive and compensatory damages plus lost back pay and jury trials capped at between five zero zero zero zero through three zero zero zero zero zero depending on the size of the employer congress squarely rejected the concept of unlimited damages for employment discrimination compensation programs should be designed to ensure fair treatment of all employees but should be determined by the market and employer needs not by the dictates of government or special interest groups because of the complexity of administering the difficulty of enforcing and the inefficiency of regulating privatesector compensation practices shrm strongly opposes any efforts to legislate or regulate comparable worth or pay equity shrm encourages organizations of all sizes to regularly perform compensation or job evaluation audits to ensure such systems do not discriminate based on gender comparable worth requirements set by the government would force employers to increase pay for many different jobs and occupations while freezing pay for others irrespective of business needs and labor market conditions if i have missed anything or you need further information or clarification please do not hesitate to contact me i will keep a watch out in the hr publications i read and forward on any new information i am interested in what kind of support this proposed law is getting and if it looks like it will make it this go around or not as an hr practitioner i have utilized shrms government affairs website to email sen hutchison and sen gramm urging them to oppose the proposed legislation if you want a copy of this let me know thanks felecia acevedo ext three nine eight one five,09:01:00,No

an economic perfect storm and an election looming gov gray davis wants to renegotiate several of the states expensive longterm power contracts a move that could translate into a big break for californians but the generators who signed the multibilliondollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state if the politicians were to make all these contracts go away who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any new contracts asked peter cartwright president of san josebased calpine corp a major supplier of california power and many experts and analysts are skeptical about davis chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state which in turn supplies california customers through various utilities good luck former republican gov pete wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the democratic governors plan davis however has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly powersupply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit the outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years perhaps decades this could save billions of dollars said doug heller of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights one of the consumer groups that has embraced davis power contract renegotiation plan barry goode davis legal affairs secretary said the administration is not targeting every contract because the pacts have been extremely valuable in keeping the market stable the governors aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies whose contracts dont require them to reopen negotiations with the state the governor signed more than five zero longterm contracts worth more than four zero billion with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year the state made shortterm purchases to supply california after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities then entered the longerterm pacts that provide about a third of the states power demands the contracts range in duration from a few months to two zero years though the contracts provide power at an average six nine per megawatthour over the next decade the current market has dropped to less than half that rate and the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times forcing california to sell the excess at multimilliondollar losses the longterm contracts harshly criticized by republicans seeking the gop gubernatorial nomination have become a political liability for davis as he heads into a reelection bid next year the liability is compounded due to the pacts potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at stanford university termed a brewing perfect storm of fiscal calamities the state public utilities commission principally citing a desire for less costly power has refused to allocate a revenue stream generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds to finance the longterm contracts the standoff has pitted davis and democratic state treasurer phil angelides against another of the states most powerful democrats senate leader john burton of san francisco who sided with the democraticcontrolled puc burton has called for californians to be freed from egregious unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts the deadlock is holding up a one two five billion bond sale intended not only to help fund californias future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency shortterm electricity purchases it would be the largest municipal debt sale in us history without the bond issue a projected general fund deficit of up to one four billion next year could grow to a staggering two zero billionplus forcing draconian cuts in essential government services according to state finance officials the projected deficit of up to one four billion in californias annual budget of about one zero zero billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy further chilled by the sept one one terrorist attacks on the east coast against the backdrop of fiscal woes analysts said successful renegotiation of some longterm power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing californians electricity rate hikes tax increases or both but some analysts are pessimistic like wilson the former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis and yet he in turn blames davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes the western power trading forum a group representing suppliers and brokers has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers were not going to say no wed certainly sit down at the table with them and say lets see maybe we can do this maybe we can do that said calpines cartwright if state officials simply broke some of their contracts not only would penalties be very very severe but also they would have completely blown their credibility and no one would negotiate with them cartwright said his comments coincided with reports that calpines thirdquarter profits more than doubled despite a sharp drop in shortterm electricity prices in california one of its main markets analysts said calpines performance can be largely attributed to its longterm contracts with the state heller one of the states most vocal consumer advocates said davis is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate or even throw out many of the contracts last spring heller said power companies had a gun to the governors head and with staff that already had conflicts of interest the administration signed some terrible deals,13:23:41,No

bilateral and forward markets the report immediately notes that ultimately the real solution to californias problems lies in increased investments in infrastructure the report recommends that the california iso conduct a realtime auction with associated measures to mitigate the impact of physical and economic withholding and significant exercises of market power during periods of scarcity one coordinating and controlling outages the iso should coordinate and approve all planned outages by units that have a participating generator agreement pga with the iso coordination and outage control procedures should then be coupled with reporting requirements to ferc and dispute review should be expedited similarly the iso should closely monitor unplanned outages and report questionable outages to ferc for further investigation two selling obligations all capacity that is available and not scheduled to run under sellers with pgas should be offered in the realtime market this obligation would not be imposed on bilateral markets of the iso dayahead markets pga generators would have to submit to ferc a dependable capacity for each unit in addition to other operating parameters necessary to calculate marginal costs such as heat rate ferc staff would then use this data in combination with published fuel costs and emission credit data to determine a price that the iso would use predetermined to mitigate prices during times of reserve deficiency load serving entities should also be required to name their curtailment price and to identify which loads will be curtailed three price mitigation when called upon to provide the available and unscheduled capacity as mentioned above pga unit prices would be mitigated in hours when there is a reserve deficiency or stage three emergencies the report notes that it is these hours which are extremely conducive to the exercise of market power by suppliers and will be obligated to sell capacity in realtime at the marginal cost of the highestpriced pga until called upon to run four realtime price mitigation for each generating unit all generating units should have a standing confidential price based on its marginal costs this price will be used by the iso to establish the realtime market clearing price when mitigation is appropriate staff believes that a single market clearing price auction design is appropriate thus reversing the recommendation to use an as bid design in the december order five market clearing price all realtime energy offers should be paid the applicable market clearing price six conditions for invoking mitigation mitigation measures should only be applied to critical operating periods such as emergencies as noted in the report staff recognizes that there are potential difficulties in implementing the proposal and that there are no easy answers to the current problems in the california market among the purported difficulties staff notes implementation problems with bidding obligations on imported power incentive effects on load scheduling treatment of purchased power mitigating prices during emergencies and setting a price component for scarcity suggested epsa comments epsa has a number of concerns with the proposal however there are a few things we commend namely one the staffs timely turnaround of the report as directed in the december order two their admission that the overarching problem cannot be solved by these shorterterm mitigation measures only by increased investments in infrastructure and three recommendation of the single price auction in the realtime market noting that it should be used for only approximately five percent of the market also to stress the importance of regulatory certainty the report recommends a datecertain sunset for the mitigation approach of no more than one year areas of concern include one it is not acceptable to use a costbased model to explain what happens to prices in a shortage period the oil shortages of the one nine seven zero s are a good illustration a nine percent cut in free world oil supplies led to the first quadrupling of oil prices from about three to one two per barrel similarly prices rose to four two in one nine eight zero with an eight percent reduction in free world oil supply two staffs proposal for calculation of the market clearing price does not create a market clearing price in scarcity situations and does not take into account the customers value of the commodity to the extent sellers costs are used full costs are not included staffs recommendation as outlined in epsas recently filed white paper on market monitoring full costs should include opportunity costs scarcity value capacity value and risk three the report fails to link high prices to any anticompetitive behavior yet still alleges such behavior throughout the report four epsa opposes the forced bidding into the realtime market as recommended this prescription precludes and preempts competitive business decisions and retards the healthy development of the market five the reports method for calculating the market clearing price is not illustrative of a true market and may create an artificial market clearing price the method proposed in fercs refund order of march nine th may be preferable to the method proposed in this report staffs method only includes participating generators and does not include imports and outofmarket purchases epsa prefers a method that is more inclusive of details and characteristics of a true market,10:35:00,No

five two five two seven nine two zero one three two zero two zero two zero mexicos much anticipated energy reform seems to have been placed on hold u ntil midtwo zero zero two the delay is due to two crucial factors the economic slowdo wn that has led to reduced electricity demand growth making reform seem le ss urgent and the controversial tax reform which is currently the primary focus of the mexican congress under the current recession industrial gro wth has slowed considerably resulting in very little growth in electricity demand this year gdp growth which is tied to electricity growth for two zero zero one is projected at less than one which is a far cry from growth in two zero zero zero of just below seven in april two zero zero one the high electricity demand growth brought re serves down to nearly zero and led to fears that severe energy shortages were imminent however the new plants that came online this year as part of t he governments independent power producer ipp program combined with muc h lower demand growth in the later part of the year reduced the sense of u rgency two zero energy reform is likely to be very controversial and may require a constitu tional change to allow greater participation in the sector for private inve stors the rival political parties to president vicente foxs national act ion party pan are expected to balk at any changes to the constitution but may accept changes to mexicos enabling laws to offer openings to private capital the mexican constitution currently requires the state to provide e nergy services as part of its public service obligations enabling laws can be changed however to exclude industry and commerce from the definition of public service which would allow a free market to operate in the electr icity sector yet investors got a preview of the opposition to reform in j une when congress blocked a proposal by president fox to increase the amoun t of electricity that companies may sell to comision federal de electricida d cfe currently power companies that generate for their own use are perm itted to sell up to two zero megawatts mw of excess power to cfe president fox hoped to allow these companies to sell up to five zero of their capacity to cfe mexicos congress ruled that this proposal was unconstitutional as it rep resented a change in law which cannot be done without first going through congress reform of the electricity sector in mexico has become more of a p olitical issue than an economic one two zero president fox faces an uphill battle in devising an energy reform plan that satisfies congress many mexicans believe that selling off stateowned com panies leads to higher prices worker layoffs and high profits for the new owners not improved service as government officials typically promise ba ck in february one nine nine nine president ernesto zedillo submitted a restructuring pr oposal to congress that envisioned the disaggregation subdivision and sub sequent sale of distribution concessions and generation companies however the proposal died in congress that year therefore any proposal put forwa rd by president fox will most likely not include plans to privatize the exi sting generation assets although there is the potential that the distribut ion assets could be subdivided and the concessions sold to private investor s two zero the resistance to selling a substantial portion of cfes generation assets creates a great challenge in mexicos effort to establish a competitive ele ctricity market that will draw private investment into new generation plant s the challenge is unprecedented in that the government would like to crea te a competitive generation market while retaining ownership of about nine zero o f generation capacity there are no global examples of how to accomplish th is feat and to make investors comfortable that the market will truly be com petitive the problem mexico faces is that investors will have to be assure d that the government will be prevented from keeping power prices artificia lly low to stimulate the economy during periods of economic slowdown the t wo issues that will have to be addressed are how cfe will determine the pri cing for its plants and the form of subsidies to cfe from the mexican gover nment two zero market pricing and subsidiestwo zero two zero two zero cfe faces the inverse of the market power issue that has plagued so many ot her competitive generation systems when an entity has market power in a gi ven region that entity can withhold its generation thereby forcing artifi cially inflated prices at this point the entity having market power ente rs the market and makes windfall profits standard poors has seen this s cenario played out in various markets all around the globe with the recent california crisis getting a great deal of attention mexico would face the opposite problem because the government through cfe would own more than nine zero of the power generation and could exercise market power to artificially keep prices low by bidding cfeowned generators below their marginal cost this might be done to provide an economic stimulus to the economy and cfe could be reimbursed through some form of a subsidy from the government be cause cfe owns such a substantial portion of the countrys generation one of its plants would likely be the marginal plant for a significant period o f time thereby eroding the profit margins of private generation companies in order to mitigate this risk for private generators the government must devise a law that would make it illegal to bid governmentowned plants at below their marginal cost and eliminate any loopholes for providing cfeown ed generation plants with government subsidies any future government subsi dies would have to be made by the mexican government to cfes distribution or transmission subsidiary not to any generation subsidiary two zero another issue that needs to be addressed is what the government will do abo ut the existing subsidies in two zero zero zero the government spent about five eight billion subsidizing electricity bills and the estimate for two zero zero one is slightly highe r due to inflation and population growth in order to highlight these subsi dies to the population the format of electricity bills was changed in july to break out the cost of power and the amount that the government is contr ibuting as a subsidy as there are no plans to do away with these subsidies the government must structure them in a way that does not benefit cfeown ed generation plants to the detriment of privately owned plants one potent ial indirect subsidy to cfe that has been addressed is the price that cfe p ays for its fuel under mexican law all public entities are forbidden to s ell their products or services below market prices therefore petroleos me xicanos pemex cannot legally provide cfeowned generators with fuel at su bsidized prices unless it offers those prices to all generators this miti gates the risk of cfe lowering its marginal cost through an indirect fuel s ubsidy from pemex two zero two zero httprddigexratingscomcgibingxcgitop need for capital investmenttwo zero two zero two zero the push toward competitive electricity markets in mexico is driven by the need for investment in power generation and the reluctance of the mexican g overnment to continue to add offbalance sheet debt in the form of the ipp contracts mexico is forecast to require investments in the power sector of about five billion per year during the next one zero years to keep up with demand most of which is expected to come from private investors although the cur rent economic conditions may adjust this forecast downward substantial inv estment will still be required in the sector even though the ipp program h as been successful thus far standard poors views these contracts as off balance sheet debt of cfe which puts negative pressure on cfes credit ra ting because the obligations under many of these contracts cross default w ith cfes debt which in turn cross defaults with some of the sovereign deb t these contracts also apply negative pressure to the sovereign rating wh ile this pressure is not substantial today if the ipp program continues to be the sole source of new generation in mexico these obligations will hav e a greater affect on the sovereign rating over time therefore a move to a fully competitive electricity market where private investors take all of the financing risks will alleviate credit pressure on the sovereign from the electric sector two zero in the interim the comision reguladora de energia cre is working on crea ting a framework for the potential liberalization of the industry cre envi sions the creation of an independent system operator to manage generation c ommitment dispatch and billing stateowned generators would be divided i nto regional entities to promote competition the distribution sector would also be divided into several regional entities and a concession for the o peration and maintenance of these systems could be granted the transmissio n network would remain as a single public entity although concessions for new transmission projects could be granted two zero two zero httprddigexratingscomcgibingxcgitop liberalization of the electricity sectortwo zero two zero two zero during the past nine years mexico has gradually liberalized the restrictio ns on the power market cfe enjoyed a monopoly in the electric power sector for many years although reforms instituted in one nine nine two allowed ipps to sell p ower to cfe and industrial customers under selfsupply regulations in one nine nine six cfe devised a financing plan to meet projected electric demand growth th e objectives of the plan were to lower the companys debt leverage finance projects at a lower cost and extend the maturities of these obligations as a result for the first time several new projects were structured as bu ildlease transfers blt which are similar to lease transactions under t his structure a third party finances and builds a plant or transmission l ine or transformer and leases the plant to cfe for a period during which the investment is amortized at the end of this timeframe ownership of the asset is transferred to cfe these blt arrangements indirectly assigned mu ch of the operating risk to cfe as cfe was required to pay for service eve n if the asset was unavailable new facilities are now being constructed un der ipp contracts these arrangements are structured as takeandpay power purchase agreements whereby cfe will not pay for power if it is not deliver ed the next step would appear to be the creation of an open market system where participants are free to buy and sell electricity yet the outlook f or the creation of such a system is unclear in mexico given the highly pol iticized tripartisan environment that governs the

eight hotmailcom gillassafairfieldkone two iaus subject re trip details dan can you imagine trying to set this up without the internet it would be impossible anyway heres a quick update from the battlefield in regards to flight plans we had a minor setback today we called our local wuxi travel agent who is setting up the majority of our airplane tix i asked her if we needed to provide them with full names that are on passports after much heated debate she said no however we then called shanghai pudong airport staff to see what their response was to our enquiry they demanded that all flight tickets show the full names that are on passports therefore ill need for you to provide me with the full names first middle last for everybody in your group well then pass these on to the wuxi agent who has already lined up the shanghaiqingdao flight well also provide the full names to agents wholl be setting up the other flights secondly let me give you a status report on the beijing leg of the journey after you sent us your beijing tour package info we consulted with lin qing we then asked our travel agent friend in qingdao zang bao guo to line us up with his agents in beijing to get another price quote jeff felt that the five two five person fee was too much he stated that he had retirement savings to consider ha weve spent the last couple days in negotiations with another beijing agent to see if she could provide us with essentially the same beijing tour package at a more budgetminded price today she gave us a rough idea on the price of the alternative beijing tour package the estimated price would be about five two zero couple for the same five day package in beijing this is in comparison to your price quite of five two five person for a five day package we would downgrade from a five star hotel to a four star hotel its new keep in mind that were still hammering out the details but the alternative package seems to be the one that would be the easiest on the wallet the crude itinerary would look something like this june one one fly to beijing in the morning check into hotel tour the forbidden city see chinese style acrobatics show in the evening june one two great wall ding temple tombs beijing roast duck dinner june one three temple of heaven summer palace dinner at the old beijing tea house singing and other entertainment provided june one four tiananmen square beihai park lunch at beihai kings food restaurant this place serves meals that the royalty would have eaten during the qing dynasty yong he gong tibetan temple free evening june one five hutong alley tour lunch at a xinjiang chinese muslim cuisine restaurant wangfujing street shopping at the trendy stores beijing opera in the evening june one six most folks would fly out of beijing to usa or shanghai we knocked out some destinations from the original plan for example the dancing performance and the trip to liu li chang antique shopping ai ping called the agent about the dancing show and decided it wouldnt be very interesting it featured some western dancing styles and the same crap we see on tv every night the dance performance didnt include any minority group dances or traditional village styles so ai ping didnt think it sounded very chinese if the antique shopping is desired its an onthestreet auction with other stores selling original and notsooriginal fake items we can slap it back on the itinerary i dont give a hoot either way i aim to please and we are extremely flexible ai pings hometown is six hours west of beijing shes been to beijing a billion times she doesnt care where we go let me know what you think and well do as instructed thirdly i dont think well be needing any deposit money the airplane tix will be reserved in your names the wuxi agent said she would arrange to have your shanghaiqingdao tix brought to your hotel in shanghai and that you could pay there the qingdaobeijing tix can be paid for in qingdao upon arrival the beijing agent hasnt mentioned a deposit for the tour package yet if she does ill put the money down no problem so that leaves you with making the decision on whether or not you want to do the shanghai tour package your call it looks like a good plan to me if you want any assistance with the shanghai leg of the journey we can do it let me know hope this gives you an idea on where were at please respond

for a potential phone call today between chancellor reed and yourself communications and indications from the uccsu team are that he may call you today as a follow up to your discussion with him on february two two zero zero one as i mentioned at the executive committee meeting on tuesday two two zero zero one all things are moving along well in california with our clients pge and sce the current exception to the smooth sailing is uccsu tom riley the account manager for uccsu has prepared the following outline of business concerns sequence of events and suggested talking points ken thank you for your assistance and continued participation with this client regards dan business concerns uc and csu have business concerns regarding enrons action to dedasr their accounts they have not communicated their concerns with enough detail that would allow us to address them but i have been able to surmise that they consist of the following one uccsu is now a bundled access customer instead of a direct access customer abone x recently signed by gov davis has ban language preventing large commercialindustrial customers from going direct access per jeff dasovich of enron gov affairs it is not clear but possible that if we had not dedasred the accounts that uccsu might have been grandfathered as a direct access customer further sbtwo seven x still pending which is senator bowens attempt to reverse the ban language of abone x may have a financial ramification for customers switching to and from direct access status dasovich is investigating further two uc and csu bought approximately one three zero meters from enron as we implemented the contract our action is forcing the utility to remove these universityowned meters meaning that their meters will become useless we are currently using those meters to provide daily one five minute interval data as required in our contract our operations and billing group have come up with a transition plan that sce has agreed to sce would install dualsockets allowing for the installation of the sce meter while keeping our meter in tact mitigating their concern at this point uc and csu are not listening to our business solutions so we have not received feedback from them on this solution three we have a contractual obligation to be the universities scheduling coordinator sc as a result of our action we are no longer their sc they are concerned this may inhibit our ability to act as their sc for their recent proposal to the iso under the demand reduction program sequence of events february one i informed the uccsu electricity oversight board leaders and contract administrators of enrons decision i walked through the power point presentation they expressed no concerns at that point and even expressed appreciation we were standing by our contract i sent the uc and csu contract administrators the letter later that day advising them of our decision february two ken lay called chancellor reed assuring the chancellor that we will honor the contract i have since heard that this call was extremely well received and that the csu campus vps have been advised of the call and kens assurances that were communicated we offered the call to the uc president as well but were channeled to his svp by the time i made contact with the svps administrator we had begun receiving letters below so i backed off on arranging the call february five uc and csu contract administrators inform us they have been speaking to their regulatory advisor and asked for some clarifications maureen palmer and i speak to the contract administrators and answer their questions february eight nine uc and csu send letters to their pge and sce account managers advising them they have concerns regarding enrons decision and that they pge and sce should only dedasr on the universities request february one two i received a letter from the uccsu contract administers asking for clarifications regarding our action and requesting we redasr their accounts february one four i responded with a letter providing them with responses to their clarification questions but did not offer to redasr their accounts as they had requested february one six uc informed me they were unhappy we did not comply with their request to redasr and indicated they would be sending another letter i suspect this letter will express potential legal recourses february two zero csu and uc informed they would hold off on the letter pending outcome of a call between chancellor reed and ken lay throughout the entire process i have been asking that the business administrators meet with us so enron can hear their concerns i gather csu would like to do this however uc is more inclined to write letters and seek legal remedies suggested talking points for call and desired outcome one we were faced with a difficult business decision and made our california decision with our customers in mind we have kept our contracts in tact other energy service providers have left the market and their customers two we are an energy outsourcing company we should source supply from the best available source in the marketplace we feel we have a contractual right to have made the decision three desired outcome is that we want to sit down with the university business administrators to listen to and address their concerns we have not been afforded this opportunity to date though we have offered however the chancellor needs to understand we are not willing to redasr their accounts in the meantime i will be available for the debrief with ken if desired i can be reached at nine two five five four three three seven zero three office or nine two five five four eight zero three two six mobile if you have any questions regards

today one that has individual investors completely in the dark about an opportunity of immense proportions a lowrisk tech stock that can easily double your money by this time next year then make your fortune several times over in the years to come ive just put the finishing touches on an urgent profit bulletin detailing this opportunity and in just a bit ill tell you how to get your free copy but first back to technologys biggest lie im talking about the socalled glut of fiber optic cable heres the real story when the world trade center got hit the internet slowed down very noticeably slowed down in fact it nearly came to a grinding halt that means there isnt nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into the system to accommodate a blip in demand sources tell me that the government is very worried about this problem after all this is the second time its happened back in july a tunnel fire in baltimore slowed the internet to a crawl for two full days that means our communications systems and therefore our economy are very very vulnerable ten years ago it wouldnt have mattered but today commerce and security is completely dependent on those systems virtually nothing moves without it thats how banks and brokerages transfer fundshow dispatchers route fleets of truckshow many americans get paid through direct deposit and we are closer to the breaking point than nine nine nine of americans even begin to understand heres one example qwest one of americas biggest carriers recently said theyre six zero loaded on their network that doesnt sound too baduntil you understand how these networks operate you cant load a network much past six five in fact seven zero is virtually catastrophic because the network spends so much time searching for open channels it doesnt spend any time actually sending packets of information the system locks communications stops the nation comes to a standstill america is falling behind the rest of the developed world internet traffic systems currently run faster in australia europe and even south america thats because we push out more data than everyone else but were not increasing capacity at anywhere near the needed rate weve got to catch up and weve got to catch up fast otherwise business the economy and our national security all go in the crapper but why do we have this capacity problem amidst a fiber glut because nine five of all the fiber that has ever been laid is dark that is its not activated and the company im recommending is the one supplier of the components needed to do the job im looking at a double possibly a triple by this time next year and i fully expect to multiply our money fivetimes over by two zero zero seven in fact this stock truly has tenbagger potential at the height of the boom this companys stock was nearly two zero times higher so what changed spending on communications networks dried up now the government is ready to pump one zero zero billion in emergency spending into the

new role in national security dark fiber does no good actual carrying capacity is strained to the limits and get this data traffic is doubling every year now that means a network running at six three

merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers as with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of

rule out involuntary separation but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible as i said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history we considered several options but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at httphomeenroncomupdates if you have additional questions please submit them to questionsenroncom mailtoquestionsenroncom we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions if you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at seven one three eight five three five six seven zero i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise including our market reach financial strength and industry experience together we will be a new merchant powerhouse and again thank you for everything you have done for enron
