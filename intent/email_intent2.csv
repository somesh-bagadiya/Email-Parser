of energy competition for every good bit of news pat wood one of our heroes at caem being selected to head the federal energy regulatory commission and the continuing progress that the canadians yes the canadians have made towards energy competition we have had to bear one disaster and misstep after another throughout the year lets see in december two zero zero zero who could have predicted one the tragic events of september one one th two the california implosion three pennsylvania marketer retrenchment four price volatility and high prices but it could have been worse if mother nature did not help out five bush energy plan ignores meaningful restructuring six enron collapse seven ferc blinks on super rto eight texas missteps in pilots for opening the market nine no leadership emerged to meet the crisis in restructuring two zero zero one was one heck of a year but thankfully probably the nadir of the movement towards energy competition in north america as caem looks into our crystal ball natural gas fired of course for the coming year we see a better year below are some of the predictions and responses from the caem staff about what we expect to occur the responses below are primarily concerned with electricity but to a lesser extent may be applied to natural gas as well as always do not bet the house on what we have to say we are just a little think tank kind of like the little engine that could and we can and we do happy new year the caem staff ps if you would like to add a prediction or two please send an email with your name and contact information to hope duncan at hduncancaemorg we will post them to our web site wwwcaemorg please identify which question below is being addressed by your prediction caem predictions in two zero zero two what does enrons collapse mean one markets work markets quickly punish mistakes little slack is given for past accomplishments markets are ruthlessly impersonal two no likely short term impact on consumers other traders will fill the space left by enron amazing that a company as large as enron can fail and hardly cause a ripple in markets testimonial to benefits of markets three may have significant impact on public policy advocacy not obvious who picks up the slack enron could be counted on to be there or so it appeared no more free riders we will all have to dig deeper and work harder consumers may be mid to long term losers if movement toward competition collapses which it might do if states stretch out the transition period to competition four enrons collapse was not caused by deregulation viewed thoughtfully it should not have any effect on deregulation movement does not stand for proposition that deregulation is not the right policy five look for more regulation and oversight of energy transactions accounting and business practices a strange legacy for enron but a reality six as a practical matter it is another setback for restructuring but not as bad as portrayed by media enron was the six zero zero pound gorilla that angered friends of competition almost as much as foes thus making them less willing to step forward will feed growing skepticism many have about restructuring seven enrons global reach into wholesale and retail markets meant that its policy positions were sometimes blurred prowholesale pro energy services other corporations will now replace enron in public policy debates these corporations may have a clearer focus eight still we have lost a champion caem will miss their culture of urgency innovation and high expectations which led to the unbundling of the classic power contract or paper or water etc into its constituent parts and offered customers choices on each one enron also pioneered risk assessment and control systems what will be the fate of the movement towards retail energy competition in two zero zero two one caem believes that the movement toward retail energy competition will continue albeit much more slowly two texas is the best model to date and will set the standard for other states in two zero zero two and beyond why the best incentives are in place for large numbers of commercial and industrial consumers to competitively shop for supply the texas model ties changes to the wholesale market to the retail market texas through ercot is unique in this respect no price caps market power of incumbents is limited enlightened leadership at the texas puc from one nine nine five to two zero zero zero our friend pat wood again but we believe commissioner perlman is a star as well and in the governors office three other states that have already made a decision to move forward will seek to correct deficiencies pennsylvania new jersey etc or avoid past mistakes altogether virginia however there will be very limited movement in these states four california will continue to suffer from a lack of imagination and poor leadership from the governor on down there is a good chance that caem will again be awarding governor davis the red china award in two zero zero two five californians will be reminded again that rolling blackouts are a form of involuntary conservation six very limited movement perhaps some experimentation or demonstration projects in those states that have done nothing to date seven increasing effort to approximate marketlike conditions but under a regulated costbased system with predictable results eight actually beyond texas the best hope for significant movement towards competition is in north america is in canada particularly alberta and ontario given the increasing interconnection between the us and canada this will slowly work its way into the united states nine it will be another wild ride for energy marketers in two zero zero two more power to them what will happen on the wholesale side of the picture in two zero zero two one caem believes that there will be significant strides made to increase liquidity and competition in the wholesale market for electricity two the federal energy regulatory commission will be successful to a degree in implementing super rtos regional transmission organizations three caem supports the bush administrations proposal to give eminent domain to ferc for the siting of new transmission lines however this proposal faces tough sledding in congress caem believes it will pass in some form probably very watered down out of necessity but not out of love many in congress still believe we can conserve our way to prosperity four the federal government and the states will make progress probably embodied in a political deal on greater cooperation this will be regional in focus both sides will give significant concessions to realize this five new players will enter market as it grows including the oil companies and more foreignbased companies wildcards predictions in two zero zero two one the bush administration will come under increasing pressure to show leadership in the area of energy restructuring to date the bush administration has stayed on the sidelines except making the right noises here and there of making energy markets more competitive this will need to change beginning with more funds and staff devoted to helping the states on the retail side and supporting ferc in their efforts on the wholesale side two the new electricity advisory board appointed by doe secretary abraham will be seen for what it is a sop to campaign supporters given its current make up we expect very little to come of it couldnt they find more energy marketers technology companies anyone that is a bit more procompetition three the department of energy will continue to have little impact if any on energy restructuring issues and will remain largely irrelevant to the competitive energy market four the department of energy will continue to fight for tougher appliance efficiency standards while totally ignoring the far lower efficiency of electricity production thus marginalizing its impact on energy efficiency five comprehensive energy legislation will probably pass in two zero zero two the question is whether it will be truly comprehensive and have a separate and new section devoted to electric restructuring the senate version does and the house is working on one our guess is that it will to some degree our hope is that the energy legislation moves beyond pork politics and members of congress will resist the temptation to earmark projects fat chance of that happening but it is christmas time six as part of the political deal there is the opportunity for a new federalism policy to be realized for the energy sector if the bush administration truly wants to move competition forward and yet have the states go along with it a new block grant with conditions for moving towards competition could be formed to serve as a carrot the feds do it with highway funds and education why not energy the states familiar with federal block grants for highways and education will try to cut as many of the strings attached to the grants as possible seven a major blackout in two zero zero two the laws of probability suggest that we are due for a reminder about how old our infrastructure is and how the lack of attention to how these markets are performing will have consequences the us has dodged many bullets in the past but probably not this year bpa will likely not cause the blackout this time as it did twice in one nine nine six unless the pacific northwest gets a lot of snow this winter or a lot of rain this spring the blackout will likely not happen in manhattan since peak demand was reduced by three zero zero mw on september one one th we recognize this a risky prediction predicting what terrorists or what the weather may do always is but it is only a matter of time eight the environmental movement will begin to wake up to the fact that its interests are not the same as those of consumer activists competition will lead to more efficient production and thus less pollution to the extent it is allowed to occur seeking lower prices at all costs including the cost to the environment consumer advocates want to preserve the monopoly model which has led and will continue to lead to the maximum use of old and polluting technologies and infrastructure nine for that matter the anticoalition kind of like antimatter not much there of critics should splinter even further vs organized labor high costs high prices one zero new gridenhancing technologies eg superconductivity and distributed energy technologies eg fuel cells should make significant market gains in two zero zero two assuming congress doe and epa take no further actions to prevent this from happening there is a lot of pessimism in the distributed energy community right now and who wouldnt be a bit pessimistic given the exit of honeywell from the market the constant technical setbacks the wariness of the utilities the bickering and backbiting etc but folks this is the future and the future starts now one one epa will continue to protect the right of existing generators to pollute at rates an order of magnitude greater than the pollution rates required of new generators in the interest of fairness one two epa will continue to discourage incremental improvements in the efficiency and emissions of existing power plants by insisting that the incremental improvements subject the plants to new source review one three epa will proceed with issuance of a proposed guidance document requiring combined heat and power systems and building cooling heating and power systems to achieve better combined electrical and thermal efficiency than the best available separate electric generation and thermal energy conversion technologies but will not require that all separate electric generation and thermal energy conversion installations use the best available technology no one will question why this efficiency requirement is coming from epa and not doe one four the tax code will continue to require owners of onsite generation systems to depreciate the systems over time periods longer than their expected useful lives,16:28:59,No

we now have a renewed focus in two zero zero one the emphasis will be to work on only the largest deals by energy commodity spend in those markets where we already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and economic third party access to retail power distribution systems the main thrust of our offering will be commodity and demand side management dsm projects and our associated price risk management capabilities commodity is enrons core competence and one where enron should be in a position to generate sizeable gross margin at closure dsm projects are also important as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the commodity competition we will be focussing on shorter project lead times at the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly we need to see eight zero of the value in two zero of the time whilst we retain an understanding of om this will not form part of our core offering and we will only consider involvement in an om capacity on attractive margin transactions where it is essential to the customer as the business develops it is likely that to some extent we will build the necessary om delivery capability to enhance the product offering in the future in those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail context we will build and develop utility representation services urs in conjunction with a dsm project offering this knowledge based business will allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale business urs is erpags core business and gives us a tremendous platform to create a pan european urs competence expertise in supply side management has increasingly become an issue for the origination team in ees europe as we have begun to get into material deal development whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the wholesale business for price risk management services there will be a renewed emphasis within ees europe to develop those commodity skills that do not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point given the renewed focus outlined above we have taken the opportunity to streamline the account delivery and management team typically redeploying staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for ees europe effective account management remains a key capability for ees and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this area organisation after eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in europe ron bertasi has decided to transition back to the us during the first half of two zero zero one in the short term he will complete the trillium property deal and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully launched i would like to take this opportunity to thank ron on behalf of everyone in europe for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in establishing the european outsourcing business and in particular his leadership on the trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for the business stuart rexrode is now head of european energy services outsourcing stuart will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator whilst ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the outsourcing team remain appropriately focussed bob manasse will head up the origination team and ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality prospects hala tayyarah has been promoted to manager within the commodity team and will provide commodity pricing support to the origination team hala will report to peter redpath until such time as a head of supply side management is appointed reporting to peter redpath peter ramgolam will lead a new activity transaction economics supporting origination by developing cashflow models to determine deal economics identify improvements to structures to optimise value and capture transactions for risk management purposes also reporting to peter redpath john parker will lead the implementation of a position management activity the attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure of ees europe which is effective immediately whilst these charts are relatively self explanatory for the levels shown there will be detailed discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for individuals where boxes are labelled tba we hope to make appointments in the near future at one zero three zero am on monday one two th february we shall be holding a one hour eeseurope all employee meeting in the auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff meeting at this session we will talk about the two zero zero one earnings plan and provide clarity on the deal process for outsourcing and the reasoning behind it also it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may have i look forward to seeing you there

 Houston Chronicle",jan five two zero zero one one two four eight am houston chronicle contracts to ease blow of rise in fuel prices helping airlines hedging your jets by laura goldberg copyright two zero zero one houston chronicle faced with higher gasoline prices in the past year consumers lamented the bite that rising oil prices were taking from their wallets other than driving less or buying cars that use less gas there wasnt much they could do airlines which consume billions of gallons of jet fuel a year also felt the sting as prices fluctuated but airlines unlike drivers can use financial tools to ease the pain of volatile fuel prices as airlines begin rolling out their fourthquarter earnings reports in the next few weeks those that hedged on fuel are likely to show better profits than those that didnt not only was that the case last year but it will continue to be the case if jetfuel and oil prices remain high gary kelly chief financial officer at lowfare southwest airlines in dallas says hedging is insurance against a catastrophic rise in fuel prices that would put us at unacceptable earnings levels hedges arent agreements to buy fuel they are financial contracts pegged to the prices of oil and oil products such as heating oil and jet fuel if airlines buy the contracts at the right prices they can collect cash to compensate them when jet fuel goes up successful hedging didnt stop airlines from raising ticket prices last year to help cover rising fuel costs but airlines say the increases might have been higher without hedging when the industrys fuel bill for two zero zero zero is tallied it is expected to be one three billion five zero percent higher than the previous years eight five billion according to a recent report from airline stock analysts at merrill lynch at the same time the airlines used only four percent more fuel if the industry hadnt hedged fuel expenses would have been two billion to three billion higher the analysts wrote amr corp the parent of fort worthbased american airlines the no two domestic carrier is expected to save five five zero million alone because of its hedging they noted airlines dont like wild spikes in fuel prices because they make it difficult to plan and they jeopardize profits a consumer would face the same dilemma if one months apartment rent was six zero zero the next it jumped to one two zero zero and the next it fell to eight zero zero thats similar to what airlines faced the past year as the benchmark price of jet fuel which is made from crude oil fluctuated widely on the spot market it was above eight eight cents a gallon in march dipped below six six cents in april rose to almost one one zero in september and was just over seven eight cents the last week in december airlines hedge to help smooth out such ups and downs greg hartford vice president for fuel at houstonbased continental airlines looks to hedging to take volatility out of the market not to secondguess it there are a variety of hedging tools some just like car or home insurance require upfront premiums hedging can be done through futures exchanges such as the new york mercantile exchange or through institutions including banks investment houses and energy traders such as houstonbased enron corp hedging is about managing risk said bill berkeland manager of trading for enron north america an enron corp subsidiary techniques to cope with fuel price risks have been around probably two zero years he said but airlines didnt adopt them until the last decade airline hedging has gained more attention recently because of jetfuel price spikes he said some carriers will be able to take victory laps for being smart enough to hedge he added while others will simply blame fuel prices for their earnings problems hedges are bought for specific amounts of product and time two million barrels a month for the next three months for example they can be pegged to the prices of crude oil heating oil or jet fuel continental generally sticks to three basic types of hedges swaps caps and collars hartford outlined the way each works swap a swap is one of the simplest types it essentially locks in the cost of energy at a specific price for a certain time no upfront payments are required for example an airline takes out a swap for one million barrels of crude oil at two five a barrel for february if the price averages two eight during february the airline is paid three million the difference between two eight and two five a barrel for the million barrels but if the cost averages two two a barrel the airline must pay three million cap with caps airlines purchase call options that protect them when prices rise but dont penalize them if prices drop caps however require upfront premium costs which are based on a variety of factors for example an airline buys a crudeoil cap at two five a barrel for one million barrels for february if at months end oil averaged two eight a barrel the airline collects three million if it averaged two two the airline gains nothing but loses nothing its cost the upfront pricepergallon premium collar a collar is more complex it involves buying two different tools that create a price range essentially a minimum and maximum the airline benefits if fuel goes above the ranges high end but pays if it goes below the minimum it can be set up so no premium is paid intuitively it would seem to make sense for airlines to hedge on jet fuel but the market for trading jet fuel isnt as liquid or as strong as the one for crude oil so airlines look for something that correlates to jetfuel prices heating oil is often best followed by crude oil there are tradeoffs premiums for jetfuel hedges are more expensive than those for heating oil in turn heatingoil hedges are more expensive than crude but using crude oil as a hedge may not smooth volatility as much because of fluctuations in the relationship between crude and jet fuel in the first part of one nine nine nine when crude oil traded for around one two a barrel atlantabased delta air lines started buying hedging contracts pegged to heating oil as far as three six months out said joe kolshak director of investor relations at the thirdlargest us airline deltas strategy has served it well for the quarter that ended sept three zero hedging including premium costs saved the atlantabased carrier from paying an extra one six zero million in fuel costs he said even with that gain delta still paid three seven percent more for fuel over the same period than the year before for the sept three zero quarter and the four preceding it delta had net hedging gains of six zero zero million hedging gains also helped balance sheets at other airlines including no five continental and no seven southwest southwests kelly said the airlines hedging last year met its goal of protecting against catastrophic fuelprice rises in the third quarter operating profits rose four three one million because of hedging during the same quarter continental gained two seven million from hedging for one nine nine nine it was one zero five million hedging isnt without risk airlines can predict the wrong way and lose millions and when prices are already skyhigh certain hedging contracts wont be attractive because they too are pegged to higher prices hedging is not a panacea and its not the golden elixir that people might consider it to be continentals hartford said,00:27:00,No

zero one asset sale between txu and edf supports european strategies of both compani es by will mcnamara director electric industry analysis news item from pr newswire txu corp nyse txu has agreed to sell its two zero zero zero mw coalfired west burton power station near retford nottinghamshire england to london electricity group for gbpthree six six million us five two three millio n in another transaction txu also announced the sale of eastern electric ity its uk distribution business and its five zero percent interest in two four seven the company that operates and maintains the distribution network to lond on electricity for gbp one three one billion us one eight seven three billion london electrici ty a distribution company that serves three million customers across brita in is a subsidiary of electricite de france edf the stateowned and lar gest energy firm in france london electricity already owns the other five zero pe rcent of two four seventwo zero analysis its rather rare that an asset sale equally benefits the two ener gy companies involved in the transaction but that appears to be the case i n this deal between txu and edf both companies are pursuing different stra tegies but they share a common goal of gaining a leading position in their respective niches in the european market the transfer of both txus gener ating station and the entire distribution business in the united kingdom to the french conglomerate edf should help both companies increase market sha re in their respective markets the divestiture enables txu to obtain its g oal of accumulating a total of about two billion in available capital to gro w its energy merchant business across continental europe for edf which ai ms to gain two zero percent of the market in britain the sale solidifies the com panys position as a leader in the distribution sector and also expands its generation assets both through its london electricity subsidiary althou gh the deal appears to be a winning transaction for both companies one stu mbling block toward obtaining necessary regulatory approval is the lingerin g frustration over edfs expansion in other countries while the french mark et remains comparatively restrictedtwo zero before moving on to the individual strategies of txu and edf lets establi sh what is included in the current transactions as noted the sale of the generation assets includes only the coalfired west burton plant for which london electricity has also agreed to complete the installation of a flue gas desulphurization process the transaction also includes a longterm con tract for txu to supply the station with coal txu europes distribution bu siness is actually the largest in the united kingdom and includes the asse ts and wires that deliver electricity through a five six zero zero zero mile network in east anglia and southeast england both transactions must obtain regulatory app roval from the european union and us regulators may review the sales as welltwo zero lets now look at the separate gains that the two companies make in these t ransactionstwo zero txu corp first it is important to note that the european expansion of dallasbased txu corp is driven by the companys txu europe subsidiary txus divestitu re of its uk power assets is part of a larger strategy that the company h as been pursuing for over a year in a nutshell txu corp has sought to ga in two billion from selling off nonstrategic assets owned by txu europe to support further growth of the companys core trading and merchant energy bu sinesses across the continent in february two zero zero one txu europe announced the s ale of its gasfield assets in the north sea to consort resources which wa s the first indication that the company was moving away from a hardasset s trategy txu believes it only needs to have access to power supply through various contracts to retain its position as a leading power trader in europ e toward this end txu europe also recently announced the sale of its two zero p ercent stake in spains hidroelectrica del cantabrico in june txu complet ed the divestiture of its one zero zero zero mw rugeley coalfired power station to inte rnational power in august txu sold two gasfired power plants in eastern england totaling seven zero five mw to centrica a british gas and home services supp lier for two five zero milliontwo zero under the current sale of its uk assets txu exits the regulated pipes an d wires business in the united kingdom and gains available capital to suppo rt further growth in its trading business across the continent specificall y from both sales txu reportedly will reach its total of two billion in ava ilable financial resources and substantially exceed its previously establis hed gbp one billion debtreduction target in other words proceeds from the sales reportedly will allow txu to strengthen its financial position by red ucing debt and txu says it expects to cut its net debttocapital ratio to five five percent by early two zero zero two however the sale of the distribution assets inc ludes a onetime writeoff of one five zero million that txu is taking associated wi th transaction and debt restructuring the writeoff has caused txu to redu ce its two zero zero two earnings by three nine cents a share the company now expects to earn b etween four three five to four four five a share next yeartwo zero with the divestiture proceeds in hand txu europes primary business model will remain focused on energy trading a market in which the company holds a topthree position throughout the continent further the asset sales ext ricates txu from the distribution sector which it acknowledges is a busine ss that provides lower returns and declining profitability the bottom line for txu in this and related sales is to recycle capital into the faster g rowing merchant energy business in the words of txu europes ceo enablin g the company to derive more than threefourths of its subsequent proceeds from this business it is important to note that txu europe includes genera ting trading and retail operations under the larger umbrella of its energy merchant operations txu europe will probably remain involved in britains retail market where the company retains the powersupply contract to serv e five five million customers but the company is no longer interested in the dis tribution sector of this markettwo zero moreover it is clear that energy trading is now the core of txus european operations txu europe holds a trading volume of approximately six zero zero gwh an d earlier in two zero zero one the parent company txu corp reported a seven five percent jump i n its revenue that was attributed in large part to its energy trading busin ess both in europe and the united states txu europe still hopes to contro l physical assets in europe as represented by its purchase this year of a five one percent state in germanys kiel utility which in terms of volumes and c ustomer base is the ninth largest of hundreds of municipalities in germany however it is clear that txu is moving out of the uk power distribution market and its sights are more clearly focused on continental europetwo zero upon the word that the sales would drag down its earnings growth for the ne xt three years txu shares fell about eight five percent on nov one nine to close at four five five nine in early morning trading on nov two zero txu shares were priced at four five one five however wall street analysts indicate that the sales should increase txu s longterm attractions because it will presumably be pursuing other acqui sitions enabled by these salestwo zero electricite de france as noted london electricity is buying the generation and distribution asse ts from txu but it must be understood that these moves are being driven by the frenchgovernment owned electricite de france londons electricitys parent company edf which still maintains a practical monopoly status in f rance purchased london electricity in one nine nine eight for one nine million british pounds two seven two billion from entergy corp based on comments from edf over the last year the company plans on expanding its products and services and investi ng in further strategic alliances to become a multienergy companytwo zero in fact london electricity acknowledges that the purchases are part of the companys strategy to consolidate its position within the united kingdom thus while the uk market no longer appears to be a core focus of txu it obviously holds appeal for other companies that are attempting to gain a m arket share in europe upon completion of the transactions edf london el ectricity will increase its share of the uk generation market to seven five perc ent from four five percent and reduce the gap that currently exists between its market share of generation versus distribution in the united kingdom londo n electricity already owns the cottam power station a two zero zero zero mw coalfired generating plant located near the west burton plant however london electr icity will still own far less generation capacity in the united kingdom whe n compared to the market leaders powergen which controls one zero zero zero zero mw and in nogy which controls about eight zero zero zero mwtwo zero thus the true focus of these purchases by london electricity may be on the distribution sector upon completion of the transactions london electrici ty will own britains largest power distribution network and control about one eight percent of the countrys distribution business analysts have suggested that edf overpaid for txus west burton plant the buying price represented a two six percent premium over the plants book value but got a fair price fo r the distribution assets the point here may be that edf was arguably will ing to pay more for the generation assets as it already holds a solid lock on distribution in the united kingdom and is attempting to expand further b y gaining control over generation assets representatives from london elect ricity have said that the company and its parent want to be one of the top five players in the united kingdom and have a goal of gaining two zero percent o f market share in the region london electricity has been named as a conten der for the uk supply company seaboard which current owner aep plans to put for sale next year seaboard serves around two million customers in eng land in the towns of kent sussex and surreytwo zero the involvement in edf in this uk expansion has added a renewed spark to an old debate namely the growth of edf into other european countries while competition in france remains comparatively restricted in other words ed f has been the target of intense criticism across europe for the last sever al years as the governments of other countries and other power firms have a rgued that edf has taken advantage of investments abroad while fiercely pro tecting its own turf for instance while germany has opened one zero zero percent of its power market to competition france has opted for a phasedin approach opening a third each of its power and gas markets by february two zero zero three and au gust two zero zero eight respectively while france remains rather blocked edf has freel y admitted that it plans to acquire other companies in england spain ital y and possibly the united states this dichotomy may become a factor as th e current transactions with txu fall under review of the european uniontwo zero an archive list of previous

2000-12-20,"[""'rick.bergsieker@enron.com'""]","[""'mike.mcconnell@enron.com'""]",Your Meeting with Oxy,i understand that you will be meeting with dale lawrence and casey olson from oxy on thursday and that terry will be briefing you on the saudi project opportunities first thing thursday am and will be participating with you in the meeting after rereading the saudi proposals today i offer the following thoughts and suggestions for your meeting terry can fill you in on more details background the saudi gas initiative was kicked off by the crown prince during a visit to the us in the fall of one nine nine nine the intent was to encourage foreign investors to bring capital and technology into the country to build a privatized gas power and water infrastructure system and to create jobs and investment opportunities for saudis the initiative is being led by the foreign minister because the crown prince is aware of resistance from aramco the oil ministry saudi electric co and saudi water co in spite of continuing resistance from these very powerful groups the initiative is moving forward essentially on schedule when the initiative was first announced enron tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that we would not qualify because we did not have adequate international upstream expertise at the same time oxy tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that they did not have adequate downstreaminfrastructure expertise oxy approached us to form a partnership which we did in good faith but with no written agreement we still have not signed an agreement with oxy but we have traded many drafts and are within days of executing an agreed mou we have been working together in good faith on orally agreed terms consistent with the draft mou oxy and enron are a good fit because oxy shares many of the enron values urgency bottomline focus objective is money not necessarily booked reserves etc oxy has made it clear that they are primarily interested in upstream investment in saudi and we have made it clear that we are not interested in upstream investment oxy understands the recent changes in philosophy in enron and is ok with this but at the same time they are worried that we may not want to put any capital in saudi and thus could jeopardize oxys competitiveness in the upcoming beauty pageant oxy maintains that throughout the process dr iranis personal friendship with the saudi foreign minister has been a big driving force in moving our proposals forward there is probably some truth to this however at the same time it is clear to both oxy and to enron that the saudi bureaucracy is more intrigued with enron than with oxy and want to find a role for us since all of our presentations to the saudis have been joint oxyenron presentations the saudis view us as linked together this is a huge deal for oxy and the dream of a lifetime for irani they are afraid that if enron drops out which we have the clear right to do the saudis may disqualify oxy i believe that their fears are justifiedi cant imagine the saudis allowing oxy to proceed alone without enron proposed way forward we and oxy have been shortlisted along with several other oil companies for two projects core project two which is an e p opportunity on the red sea coast near jordan combined with a gasliquids processing plant a pipeline a potential powerwater plant and a potential petrochemicals facility the market area on the red sea coast has huge growth potential core project three which is an e p opportunity in se saudi near the uae border combined with a pipeline to eastern saudi a liquids plant and several potential downstream facilities there is the potential to export this gas to the uaedolphin but it is a long shot terry can give you details on both of these proposed projects each of these projects will require several billion dollars of capital and they each have large upstream components the marketing network potential both within saudi and internationally is huge but the dilemma is to carve out a role for enron that fits with our corporate philosophy i understand that dale lawrence has proposed to you that we tell the saudis that oxyenron want to proceed as joint partners and then settle up behind the veil such that the upstream capital and risk are oxy responsibilities i dont like this approach because the press wont see beyond the veil and will report it as enron being a five zero five zero partner in one or two four billion deals in saudi on the other hand i want to be in these projects because the potential in saudi is huge and the egm spinoffs liquids etc could also be huge i believe that there is a simple way to address both our needs and oxys needs the saudi proposals break both core project two and core project three into two pieces an upstream e p and gas processing venture under a traditional psc arrangement with aramco as the controlling partner and the foreign partner as operator and various downstream pipeline power water and potentially distribution companies in which aramco will not be a participant but that other saudi investors may want a piece of these downstream ventures will buy gas from the upstream ventures and will be subject to pipeline and privatisation regulatory regimes that have not yet been invented i suggest that we propose to the saudis that enron and oxy will be working as partners but that oxy will be the sole investor and operator for all upstream components enron on the other hand will undertake to be the developer and operator for the pipelines and downstream facilities but will structure such projects as opportunities for various saudi investors supported by project financing and with ipos as soon as possible in structuring such projects enron would work with the saudi government to develop appropriate regulatory regimes enron as developer and operator would forego the right to any equity in such projects in order to maximize the investment opportunities for saudis but would instead cover its development costs and earn a profit via operating and development fees to the downstream ventures and success fees at financial close andor other milestones this approach would give oxy the hard capital investment in saudi that they want while giving enron the opportunity to earn a return on intellectual capital it would give us the chance that we want for a dialogue with the saudis to define the basis for a robust marketoriented systemsimilar to the opportunity that enron japan hopes to develop through working with the japanese government it would also give us an on the ground relationship with government authorities that control policies for the export and marketing of saudis crudes and liquids we could also offer to be the exporterofftaker for any liquids produced by oxy terry and rob are going to kick this around a bit tonight and may have a more well thought out approach by thursday but i wanted to get these basic thoughts to you to give you terry and rob some food for thought rick,01:04:00,"Yes,

are also ignoringtwo zero government buying and selling of currencies the current account surplus three d exports imports interest and profits received from net foreign assets exchange rates an exchange rate is the price of one currency in two zero terms of another for example a french franc ff costs one five seven yesterday while it was one zero when i traveled in france in one nine eight five the us currently has floating exchange rates meaning that the valu etwo zero of the dollar fluctuates the is about one zero five eight yen today but has varied from one zero three seven six to one two four four four in the last one two months thus the dollar bought fewer yeni t weakenedover much of the last year under fixed exchange rates there would in principle be no dayto day changes in the exchange rate the federal reserve would buy and sell dolla rs and foreign currencies to keep the exchange rate fixed the float is a lit tle bit dirty since the fed and other central banks intervene on currency markets ie buy and sell dollars to affect the value of the dollar unlike the us most nations in the world fix their exchange rates with someone a few dozen use common currencies the west african franc is used by many former french colonies and panama uses the us other countries such as argentine or hong kong promise to keep as many us dollars or dm as they have circulating currency this currency board arrangement makes a fixed exchange rate credible because if folks want to sell the local currency th ere are always dollars or dm to redeem them the value of the dollar many factors affect the value of the dollar us and foreign aggregate demand us and foreign interest rates speculative bubbles and so forth the dollar becomes stronger ie can buy more of a foreign currency when us real interest rates r are high if r is high two zero then foreigners want to buy dollars in order to put them into us banks and recei ve the high interest rate when the demand for dollars goes up so does its two zero price in terms of foreign currencies it gets stronger the net demand for dollars is low and the dollar will depreciate weaken two zero when foreigners dont want to buy us goods us exports low foreigne rs importing little us want to buy foreign goods us imports high foreigners exporting a lot us ad high implies leakage to foreign markets im high foreigners dont want to buy us assets often when us interest rates are low us wants to buy foreign assets often when foreign real interest rates are high people think will get even weaker this adds a speculative

morality play of international trade chris and pat were having a conversation one day upstairs at kips chris pat i dont see how you can be for free trade if taiwan grows fas ter than us we will lose pat chris you clearly do not understand the great economist ricardos ide atwo zero of comparative advantage c thats for sure i dont wazzat p comparative advantage is what you are least worst or most best at for example this great entrepreneur whose name escapes me was the worlds fast est typist but hired a secretary nevertheless he was perhaps five times as productive as she was as an entrepreneur but only three times as productive as a typistthus he had absolute advantage in both but she had comparative advantage in typing c so what does that have to do with free trade p an example may clarify step over to this handy blackboard and let me write a bit first imagine a world with two countries the us and taiwan two zero and two goods computers and wine further assume that labor is the only inpu t into production each country has one zero zero hours of labor first consider a case with no trade when each nations output equals their consumption usa with no trade product productivity output computers three zero hrs pc two wine two hrs bottle two zero total hours three d three zero two two two zero three d one zero zero taiwan with no trade product productivity output computers one zero hrs pc eight wine one hrs bottle two zero total hours three d one zero eight one two zero three d one zero zero note that taiwan makes computers in one three the us time and wine in one two the us time thus taiwan has absolute advantage at both wine and computers tai wan has comparative advantage is most best at computers us has comparative advantage is least worse at wine now lets see what happens if we permit trade the us will specialize in two zero wine what it is best at the world price will be about one two bottles of wine per p ctwo zero in the world with trade usa with trade product productivity output consumption computers three zero hrs pc zero two wine two hrs bottle five zero two six wine two hrs bottle five zero two six total hours three d zero three zero two five zero three d one zero zero consumption of wine three d production two four sold to taiwan consumption of computers three d two bought from taiwan taiwan with trade product productivity output consumption computers one zero hrs pc one zero eight wine one hrs bottle zero two four total hours three d one zero one zero zero one three d one zero zero both countries receive at least as much of both goods after trade the ex act price with free trade and therefore the amount of consumption in eachtwo zero country depends on the demand elasticities in the two countries and other factors thus in a world of comparative advantage trade helps both countries two zero nations should specialize in what they do best complete specialization as in thi s example is an extreme case as adam smith pointed out two zero zero years ago specialization permits all to grow wealthier c your argument assumes quite a bit implicit in your example is the assumption that when the us quits producing computers all of those coryha ll types be magically transformed into vit eno majors from davis if we are in a recession then the computer workers who lose their jobs wont get new jo bs policies to protect our domestic industry can avoid unemployment and increa se aggregate demand p you are recommending beggarthyneighbor policies since any gain in o ur demand is offset by losses to our neighbors if we get started on that ta ck the whole world loses not everyone can increase demand by restricting imports c even without the macroeconomic problem there is still the unemployment caused by free trade destroying industries how will all the excomputer f olk get the skills to make wine p you are correct and both us computer makers and taiwanese wine makers two zero both companies and employees prefer not to have trade in the short run the po int is that the winners ie us wine makers taiwanese computer makers and consumers in both countries win more than the losers lose c if free trade brings so many benefits then it should bring enough prosperity to compensate the losers it is not fair to the computer worker s that they bear the cost of adjustment it makes sense to tax some of the winners and pay some subsidy to help the losers retrain full employment is not your only key assumption you also assume that mark ets are competitive so that firms make no monopoly profits in fact it appea rs that some industries make big profits when we lose market share in these industries the capital flows to a less profitable industry p again i must grant your point that there are monopolistic industries an d most americans would rather the monopoly profits stay at home in general free trade eliminates monopoly profits and will help consumers enormously c yes but in addition to there being highprofit industries there are highwage industries so workers care which industry they are in when we two zero lose market share in these industries the workers move to industries with lower two zero pay and lower productivity autoworkers who become hamburger flippers are not making a marginal switch to their next bestpaying job for example boeing has traditionally made big profits and paid its worker s well when europeans subsidized airbus and we lost airplane manufacturing jobs we lost both those high profits and the workers had to move to lowerwage employers p i agree that it is theoretically possible for subsidies to increase a nations welfare if the subsidies bring oligopoly profits and highwage jo bs nevertheless it would be better for everyone if nobody subsidized andtwo zero markets were more competitive in the us today both imports and exports are mostl y made in highwage jobs thus we should favor the expansion of trade not restrictions c your hypothetical situation is irrelevant since other nations are subsidizing japan is famous for protecting its industries until they beco me big enough to compete internationallythen watch out p do you really think that the us steel auto and computer industries are too small to compete internationally c well i have to admit that usx gm and ibm are not what one usually thin ks of as part of infant industries but the japanese also subsidize industrie s and dump exports below cost in order to drive competitors out of business once they have a monopoly then they really gouge p have the japanese really increased prices of color tvs ram chips or ot her goods antidumping laws primarily mean that foreigners are not allowed to two zero cut pricesprice cuts that would benefit us consumers even with an uneven playing field i disagree with you as usual with protectionists you ignore consumers when european subsidies created airb us airbus made the market for passenger aircraft much more competitive us consumers won in terms of lower airfaressomething you forgot to stress in your arguments about boeings loss of high profits and highwage jobs i am very suspicious of these claims that we need to protect all sorts of industries since it gives companies enormous incentives to pour money into lobbying the large firms of the us steel industry have been incredibly successful at lobbying for protection this protection has mostly protecte dtwo zero an inefficient oligopoly at great cost to us consumers c but we sometimes need protection as a stick to beat foreigners intotwo zero opening their markets to us p while protection can be a stick it is not easy to wield it seems most likely to lead to a trade war where retaliation by foreigners leads them t o close markets to us if we restrict trade usually when we run protectionism it is in the form of the misnamed voluntary export restraint ver like the one that we have with thetwo zero japanese for automobiles these basically require the foreigners to form a cartel lower sales and increase price i do not know why the us government helps foreigners run cartels that hurt us consumers antitrust policy is suppos ed to restrict cartels the auto vers cost consumers over one zero zero zero zero zero for each us job that is saved c well i am not convinced all of your arguments concerning the advanta ges of free trade are based on this notion of comparative advantage which you assume is somehow granted by nature in todays hightech industries comparative advantage is won by experience in producing complicated technologies not by weather or natural resources p if comparative advantage is won by experience then experience in produc ing becomes a sort of investment why cant us firms undertake investments tha t are profitable you cannot seriously believe that ibm is too small to comp ete with foreigners c but there are spillovers from one industry to another the experience o f silicon valley for example shows that when one part of hightech does wel l other parts learn from it and do well also even your economists have always agreed that when there are positive externalities that there is a role for public subsidies for example an innovating firm rarely captures all the gains of its research and developme nt in the example above when new computer technologies are developed only th e taiwanese will be able to develop the new products based on their expertise in pc manufacture p i agree that companies providing positive spillovers should be encourage d i think that support of university research coupled with an rd tax credit makes more sense than protectionism you on the other hand seem to be promoting an industrial policy in whi ch the government picks winners to promote didnt the billions of dollars th at france and britain poured into the concorde supersonic transport as well a s wastage of the us with synfuels synthetic gasoline teach you that industria l policy wont work c well arent you selfrighteous the us has always had a multitude of vigorous and expensive industrial policies they have just gone under atwo zero variety of other names and have never been coordinated to work together agricultu re receives billions in subsidies steel and textiles have quotas on imports lockheed and chrysler received governmentbacked loans and housing gets th e mortgage interest deduction perhaps most importantly a vast proportion o f our research is funded by the military which has always looked to advantag es for certain industries all i want is a rational and democratic industrial policy we should coordinate our goals and choose our subsidies more democratically and in ways that do two zero not work to crosspurposes for example any bailouts or protection from impor ts should be short run and explicitly tied to promises to invest in newtwo zero machinery and new skills for workers new technologies to be promoted should be chos en by democraticallychosen representatives not by nameless bureaucrats at da rpa the defense advanced projects research administrationan agency almost nobody has heard of p i would just as soon cut subsidies to all those industries as adjust wha t subsidies i give nevertheless i grant you that if subsidies are given th ey should at least include promises from the industry and its workers to inves t not just enjoy high current wages and profits c youre starting to talk sense now we must always keep in mind thattwo zero america needs high tech to maintain its competitiveness p i dont understand this word competitiveness i like you would like us productivity to grow quickly so that we are more prosperous and have more resources to care for the disadvantaged the environment and so forth i two zero care about the absolute level of us growth not the relative level c but if the us growth more slowly than japan we will lose our standing a s a world power p i am not thrilled about any nation being overwhelmingly powerful it is ok with me if the us must consult with its allies before invading various smal l open economies c well i have won enough points from you that i should probably stop yo u agree that at least in theory protectionism can help keep highprofit highwage and highspillover industries at home and raise national output p i must agree in theory and also remind you that the industries have political clout to receive protectionism are often the worstrun two zero furthermore any protectionist policy leads to the risk of trade wars and they make everyone worse off c hey thats enough economics talk lets go have a

be accounted for as inadvertent interchanges as is customary between adjacent control areas furthermore new horizon requests that we require duke to negotiate with it in good faith to establish a

fact duke and new horizon agreed in their network operating agreement noa that the dynamic scheduling information may not be one zero zero percent accurate and also eight that this should not be a basis for penaltiestwo zero six duke may not file an answer to new horizons rehearing request merely because new horizon alternatively argued for clarificationtwo zero seven these mismatches are the result of the inherent differences between the actual metered load for an hour and the dynamic schedule value for the same hour created by integrating the four second dynamic scheduling signal values over the hour eight see noa section seven zero g original sheet no one three we further note that section seven zero e of the noa allows for the estimation of dynamic scheduling data and that the use

four mismatches that result during successful operation of dynamic scheduling if accounted for by duke through schedule four energy imbalance service would cause double recovery once through

accounted for by duke only through inadvertent interchange new horizon should only be subject to duke s schedule four energy imbalance service during periods when new horizon s dynamic scheduling fails to operate successfully we further agree with new horizon that it is necessary to define what constitutes successful dynamic scheduling in order to then determine what should occur in the event that dynamic scheduling is not successful accordingly we direct the parties to negotiate in good faith to establish a standard for successful operation of dynamic scheduling and to incorporate this

door halfawake and nearly paralyzed with fear you hear muffled whispers at least two people have broken into your house and are moving your way with your heart pumping you reach down beside your bed and pick up your shotgun you rack a shell into the chamber then inch toward the door and open it in the darkness you make out two shadows one holds a weaponit looks like a crowbar when the intruder brandishes it as if to strike you raise the shotgun and fire the blast knocks both thugs to the floor one writhes and screams while the second man crawls to the front door and lurches outside as you pick up the telephone to call police you know youre in trouble in your country most guns were outlawed years before and the few that are privately owned are so stringently regulated as to make them useless yours was never registered police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died they arrest you for first degree murder and illegal possession of a firearm when you talk to your attorney he tells you not to worry authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter what kind of sentence will i get you ask only tentotwelve years he replies as if thats nothing behave yourself and youll be out in seven the next day the shooting is the lead story in the local newspaper somehow youre portrayed as an eccentric vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir boys their friends and relatives cant find an unkind word to say about them buried deep down in the article authorities acknowledge that both victims have been arrested numerous times but the next days headline says it all lovable rogue son didnt deserve to die the thieves have been transformed from career criminals into robin hoodtype pranksters as the days wear on the story takes wings the national media picks it up then the international media the surviving burglar has become a folk hero your attorney says the thief is preparing to sue you and hell probably win the media publishes reports that your home has been burglarized several times in the past and that youve been critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the suspects after the last breakin you told your neighbor that you would be prepared next time the district attorney uses this to allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars a few months later you go to trial the charges havent been reduced as your lawyer had so confidently predicted when you take the stand your anger at the injustice of it all works against you prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean vengeful man it doesnt take long for the jury to convict you of all charges the judge sentences you to life in prison __________________________________________ this case really happened on august two two one nine nine nine tony martin of emneth norfolk england killed one burglar and wounded a second in april two zero zero zero he was convicted and is now serving a life term how did it become a crime to defend ones own life in the oncegreat british empire it started with the pistols act of one nine zero three this seemingly reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and established that handgun sales were to be made only to those who had a license the firearms act of one nine two zero expanded licensing to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns later laws passed in one nine five three and one nine six seven outlawed the carrying of any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of all shotguns momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after the hungerford mass shooting in one nine eight seven michael ryan a mentally disturbed man with a kalashnikov rifle walked down the streets shooting everyone he saw when the smoke cleared one seven people were dead the british public already desensitized by eighty years of gun control demanded even tougher restrictions the seizure of all privately owned handguns was the objective even though ryan used a rifle nine years later at dunblane scotland thomas hamilton used a semiautomatic weapon to murder one six children and a teacher at a public school for many years the media had portrayed all gun owners as mentally unstable or worse criminals now the press had a real kook with which to beat up lawabiding gun owners day after day week after week the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and demanded a total ban on all handguns the dunblane inquiry a few months later sealed the fate of the few sidearms still owned by private citizens during the years in which the british government incrementally took away most gun rights the notion that a citizen had the right to armed selfdefense came to be seen as vigilantism authorities refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened claiming that selfdefense was no longer considered a reason to own a gun citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were charged while the real criminals were released indeed after the martin shooting a police spokesman was quoted as saying we cannot have people take the law into their own hands all of martins neighbors had been robbed numerous times and several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young thugs who had no fear of the consequences martin himself a collector of antiques had seen most of his collection trashed or stolen by burglars when the dunblane inquiry ended citizens who owned handguns were given three months to turn them over to local authorities being good british subjects most people obeyed the law the few who didnt were visited by police and threatened with tenyear prison sentences if they didnt comply police later bragged that theyd taken nearly two zero zero zero zero zero handguns from private citizens how did the

utilities ray nixon power plant denverbased xcel energy inc formerly public service serves denver northern colorado and other areas outside of colorado springs it plans to spend one five five billioncq to upgrade its powergeneration and transmission capacity around the state the goal is to have enough new power for one six million households beyond the two five million customers xcel energy now serves earlier this year xcel sought proposals from companies interested in meeting its projected power needs enron north america corp a subsidiary of houstonbased enron an electric gas and communications powerhouse was one of nine successful bidders responding to xcels request for proposals those nine bidders will help supply about one five zero zero megawatts of generating capacity around colorado another successful bidder wilexco inc of englewood also was chosen by xcel and plans to build an eight three megawatt plant south of the planned enron facility at a cost of more than nine zero million it will burn tires to generate its power although the facility still needs to clear various local and state regulatory hurdles enron should complete its facility by june said eric thode director of public relations for enron north america corp wilexcos plant is targeted for operation by two zero zero three said company owner brian wilde xcel spokeswoman jessica anderson said her company has a one zero year deal with enron to buy power wilde said his deal with xcel is for one five years the people who live and work here in colorado need this additional generation anderson said at the end of those initial contracts enron and wilexco could sell power to other users the opportunity for such deals might be enhanced if colorado deregulates its electric industry and opens it up to competition until now state lawmakers have rejected deregulation efforts still anderson said the addition of the power plants helps position the state for the time when deregulation takes place xcel as public service supported deregulation legislation in the general assembly wilde of wilexco said selling electricity in a deregulated market wasnt the reason his firm sought to build its plant because he doesnt know what the electric industry will be like in one five years thode echoed that sentiment saying this plant is being built for the deal as it currently exists this deal makes sense because this deal makes sense period colorado springs utilities also is adding generating capacity two three zero megawatt gasfired turbines have been added to the nixon plant which burns coal to

four six one six inevitably you are going to get some profittaking as we get near the end of the quarter and people want to lock in some of their profits said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey ed tirello of deutsche banc alex brown said the decline was due in part to investors viewing enron as a technology play because of its online trading and broadband businesses consequently enrons stock was susceptible to weakness in the techheavy nasdaq market this month which appeared to have triggered selling by momentum investors tirello said merrill lynchs eassey said enrons stock might also have been hurt by an article in the weekly texas supplement to the wall street journal which called into question the trading profits reported by enron and other big energy marketers eassey dismissed the article as misleading and said he retained a buy rating on enrons stock with a one two monthprice target of nine five this is a stock that youve got to have in your core portfolio enron is still one of the premier companies that you can own in all of the market he said however investing in enron was not without risks and amounted to betting on the companys ability to execute successfully on

2000-11-27,"[""'susan.scott@enron.com'""]","[""'maria.pavlou@enron.com'""]",Recourse rate dilemma: the sequel,maria and drew this is a longwinded email but please bear with me the problem as you probably remember several months ago several of us met to discuss the following language in the rofr portion of transwesterns tariff if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate and the additional frustrating language all available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures at our last meeting we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that tw could capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate to index prices however since this usually involves an unacceptable amount of risk to both the shipper and tw the marketers havent done any indexbased rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals i have been asked by the commercial group to revisit this issue and to think of other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum rate ideally they would like to eliminate the language ive quoted above however my research has indicated that absent our one bringing about radical change in the way ferc thinks about recourse rates or two showing that tw lacks market power we are probably stuck with this language why the problem exists you may already know steve stojic and i did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in the first place in the alternative rates policy statement rmnine five six zero zero zero the commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for negotiated rates but only where customers retain the ability to choose a costofservice based tariff rates the availability of a recourse service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that the customer can fall back to costbased traditional service if the pipeline unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service thus the recourse rate mitigates market power the commission went on to confirmed that under rofr provisions the highest rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate this policy is clearly not limited to rofr situations when capacity is constrained a shipper willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate when there are more requests for capacity than there is capacity available then the pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate for example on a pro rata basis if required by its tariff the example cited by the commission if a pipeline has one zero zero dthd available and two shippers request that capacity one who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of five and another a negotiated rate of six then each would be allocated five zero dthd on a pro rata basis assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some other allocation method such as lottery when tw filed for authority to charge negotiated rates it voluntarily added the statement that if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate presumably we had concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order to receive negotiated rate authority solutions i would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language outright is probably out of the question i feel as if ive really been chasing my tail here i have owed lindy an answer for some time now but i keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power which drew is where i believe you were headed when we talked about this in midoctober steve harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system i think we would still have to show lack of market power in order to do this do you agree stojic warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive proposition might be worth it to us though another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more than max rate after all we do have authority to charge negotiated rates weve seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more than max rates for it space based on good customer relations alone however despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers its unlikely we can pull this off with any consistency we wondered whether we might be able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure but i just am not convinced we could get around the commissions requirement that recourse rates be available that requirement has not changed have either of you seen anything to the contrary i would like to meet with you two plus several others i have in mind to discuss this

commission has issued a revised draft of the barnett decision today which retroactively suspends direct access to july one the cover letter states as follows this version differs from the draft mailed on august one five two zero zero one in several ways first the effective date of the suspension has been changed from september one two zero zero one to july one two zero zero one as proposed in the draft mailed june one five two zero zero one second the draft decision clarifies that customers who have executed direct access contracts prior to july one two zero zero one may continue to receive power from electric service providers for the initial term of the contracts several other editorial and explanatory changes have also been made assembly bill no one from the first extraordinary session abone x requires that direct access be suspended until the department of water resources no longer supplies power to the customers of the three largest regulated electricity companies it directs that the commission determine the effective date of the suspension in order to reduce the possibility of harm to customers and to resolve potential conflict parties should comment on one whether abone x suspends the entire direct access program including all transactions under that program two how the commission can comply with abone x if it exempts written contracts for direct access executed before july one two zero zero one from the suspension and three whether july one two zero zero one is an appropriate date for the suspensioncomments on the draft decision are permitted those comments are to be electronically served on the service list for those who have electronic addresses no later than one zero zero zero am on september four two zero zero one and shall be filed with the commission by five zero zero pm on that date the specific wording in the decision is the legislature has directed this commission to suspend direct access until dwr no longer procures power for the retail endusers and we find it should be suspended effective july one two zero zero one the legislative direction is clear and the suspension should apply to sce pacific gas and electric company pge and san diego gas electric company sdge in the interest of providing cost stability for current direct access customers written contracts for direct access signed before july one two zero zero one are exempt from the suspension for the initial term of the contracts it also provides that in comments on the draft decision several parties questioned the need for the commission to implement the legislative suspension of direct access as soon as july one two zero zero one by the draft decision mailed for comment to the parties on june one five two zero zero one market participants were provided notice that direct access would be suspended as of july one two zero zero one the commission postponed its consideration of the draft decision however we do not change the effective date of the suspension the underlying legislation was introduced on january three two zero zero one enrolled and sent to the governor on february one two zero zero one and signed by the governor the same day market participants have now had eight months since then to prepare for this event we do not wish to reward customers who have switched to direct access since july one two zero zero one in the hope

crises bna gramm says changed markets demand dramatic review reform of securities laws bna lack of banking safeguards in hk financial times japan risks slide into downward spiral financial times accounting shift lifts deutsche profits american banker argentinas strife not over yet financial times feds mcdonough sees global strains from slowdown reuters english news service may four two zero zero one new york may three reuters federal reserve bank of new york president william mcdonough said on thursday the international financial system is showing some signs of strain from a slowdown in global growth mcdonough in remarks prepared for delivery to a banking group in frankfurt germany said there is no broad agreement on how to handle international financial crises during the latter part of the one nine nine zero s the international financial system has endured perhaps its greatest stress in the postwar period and currently we again are seeing signs of strain associated with the global slowdown in growth mcdonough said in a text of his speech released in advance the new york fed chief did not comment further on the global economy or discuss the us economy in the speech which focused on global financial stability mcdonough is also chairman of the basel committee on banking supervision which recently completed a new accord on bank capital standards there is a broad consensus on the need to strengthen financial institutions at the national and international level in order to create more crisis resistant economies mcdonough said but there is no comparable degree of consensus on how to best handle international financial crises once they do erupt in particular there is unease that the current approach to crisis management that has evolved out of the experiences in mexico and asia notwithstanding its successes in some cases entails solutions that are potentially too costly he said critics feel the solutions entailed repeated reliance on largescale support packages introduced adverse incentives or moral hazard and were in themselves a source of uncertainty and potential instability mcdonough added he advocated a flexible casebycase approach to crisis management adding that regulators should strive for minimalist intervention the role of regulators is not to limit banks opportunities for growth and profit at the same time if we encourage responsible behavior we must not create the illusion that we will rescue every institution that does not succeed he said mcdonough advocates flexible approach to prevent cope with financial crises bna may four two zero zero one by jeffrey goldfarb a flexible casebycase approach with minimal intervention by regulators is the best way to prevent and cope with financial crises said william mcdonough the president of the federal reserve bank of new york and chairman of the basel committee on banking supervision speaking may three in frankfurt germany mcdonough said bank supervisors around the world should be working to enable banks to better manage their businesses and their risks at the same time if we are to encourage responsible behavior we must not create the illusion that we will rescue every institution that does not succeed he said mcdonough said that disclosure practices by banks although improved over the past decade have not kept up with the many changes in the way they manage their risk he recommended that banks rethink what they consider proprietary information it is critical to approach the question of disclosure as users of financial statements he said shareholders creditors and counterparties cannot understand the risks of their own exposures to a bank until they first understand that banks appetite for risk and its approach to and methodologies for managing risk what should drive this debate is market participants need for information to make sound and secure credit and investment decisions rather than the concerns some have about what was once considered secret amidst his remarks an advance text of which was released in new york mcdonough briefly commented on the state of the global economy saying there are some unfavorable signals during the latter part of the one nine nine zero s the international financial system has endured perhaps its greatest stress in the postwar period and currently we again are seeing signs of strain associated with the global slowdown in growth he said mcdonough explained that the solutions to recent crises in mexico and asia even though successful may have led to certain currently held tenets that are too costly introduce adverse incentives or moral hazards and are in themselves a source of uncertainty and potential instability but the alternatives he said look even more unpalatable in their implications notwithstanding considerable efforts at the public and private level to search for a better way no magic bullet formula has been found nor is one likely to be available in essence mcdonough said the quest for some broad universal solution to financial crises is a pollyannalike pursuit if history is any guide he said new developments in markets and practices quickly will render obsolete those measures that might seem well attuned to todays circumstances for that reason mcdonough encouraged a supremely tactical and creative casebycase approach to handling crises he specifically argued against standstill solutions which suspend debt service usually in conjunction with the imposition of capital controls mcdonough said that approach in his opinion could make investors skittish and make it harder to generate support for honoring contractual commitments standstills also undermine market discipline of and ownership by the local authorities he said to sum up i believe the one size fits all disposition inherent in the standstills approach risks making situations much worse than they need to be he said the only thing that strikes me as predictable under such an approach would be that market access would be harmed across the board just as bailouts may encourage too much risk taking efforts to orchestrate preemptive bailins may encourage too little gramm says changed markets demand dramatic review reform of securities laws bna may four two zero zero one by rachel witmer senate banking committee chairman phil gramm rtexas said may three that the changes in the us securities markets since the one nine three zero s and especially in the last one zero years demand a dramatic review and reform of securities regulation gramm had previously announced his intention to conduct a toptobottom review all of the securities laws with the intention of modernizing them speaking at a meeting of the security traders association gramm said that the review will be openended and that he will not prejudge the conclusions from the effort the senator said that the question he asks in looking at laws and regulations is are the benefits of this regulation in the market as it exists today worth what were paying for them in addition he emphasized that there will continue to be dramatic change in the markets and said i want the change to be dictated by the markets and not the government one change that he suggested might come in the long run is that securities markets per se could become a thing of the past im not certain that markets are not obsolete he said later in his remarks gramm clarified his statement saying i dont know if markets make sense any more he made an analogy between markets and traditional book stores which have serious competition from online book stores the internet has revolutionized the book market gramm said he then asked is a centralized market necessary nyses survival at another point in his remarks gramm suggested that as allelectronic markets are proliferating and changing competition in the securities markets the new york stock exchanges survival is not guaranteed in other comments gramm emphasized that while he may refer an individual to the white house for consideration as a potential nominee for the chairmanship of the securities and exchange commission the president is going to name the chairman and not me asked about the length of time it is taking for the white house to nominate someone for that position gramm said i dont see that any great harm is coming from it gramm told reporters after his remarks that he hoped the administration will nominate someone who was knowledgeable openminded and free market finding all those qualities on one person is hard he said on the topic of decimals gramm said that he did not see the recent decimalization of the securities markets as a fundamental reform as of april nine all securities are priced and traded in decimals

banking consumers said a study yesterday by the territorys de facto central bank joe leahy reports from hong kong hong kong has no general competition law no regulator with an explicit mandate for protecting banking consumers and no ombudsman scheme to process complaints the consultative study by the hong kong monetary authority hkma found as the hong kong market is becoming more sophisticated and more competitive and as consumer issues are coming more to the fore it is timely to consider whether the current arrangements in hong kong remain appropriate it said despite its probusiness bias hong kong has been forced to reexamine the issue of depositor protection following moves to deregulate the banking sector japan risks slide into downward spiral financial times may four two zero zero one by gillian tett falling exports to asia and the us and the fragility of its banking system mean japan risks sliding into a downward spiral with severe regional consequences for trade the organisation for economic cooperation and development warned yesterday in its latest halfyearly report the oecd report says japan may need to bail out the banks a move the government has ruled out the report comes at a critical time for the new government of prime minister junichiro koizumi the parisbased thinktank attracts considerable respect in japan and mr koizumi is due to make his inaugural speech to parliament on monday in which he will set out the governments economic policy the oecd report asserts that the level of bad loans is probably larger than the government admits meaning that some banks may not have sufficient capital to write off their bad debts in some cases realistic writeoffs might even wipe out the capital altogether requiring banks to reduce the scale of their operations raise capital in the market or seek public financial support it says the condition of the banking system is likely to be a key focus of mr koizumis speech he has pledged to introduce measures to clear out the bad loans rapidly under pressure from countries such as the us the government insists the banks have sufficient capital to complete this task public funds should be injected only when the financial system faces a crisis hakuo yanagisawa financial reform minister said recently some yseven four five zero bn dollars six one bn of public funds were injected into the largest banks in one nine nine nine but many analysts and diplomats fear that without government help the banks will be too weak to write off their bad loans rapidly the mountain of bad loans has damaged corporate confidence and left the financial sector reluctant to lend however forcing banks to cut their loans to unviable borrowers could lead to more bankruptcies and rising unemployment in the short term the oecd admits managing the loan cleanup will be a huge task for the authorities in particular as flagging confidence may dictate that it will have to be carried out in a short period of time it says the timing of the cleanup is unfortunate since japan is suffering the knockon effects of the slowdown in the rest of the global economy through lower exports the oecd suggests that if more funds are injected into the banks that the bank managers should be sacked and the shareholders should not be rescued however any fresh injections of public funds could trigger strong public protest it could also fuel japans spiraling debt burden which is projected to hit one five eight per cent of gdp in two zero zero six and one three eight per cent next year the oecd calculates the government will need to tighten fiscal policy by one zero percentage points of gdp by two zero one zero simply to stabilise the debt this is currently equivalent to yfive five zero zero zero bn a sum exceeding total central government tax revenue on current growth trends tax revenue would therefore need to be doubled if the adjustment occurred on the tax side alone the oecd added that monetary policy would need to be highly supportive it expects to see one per cent growth in calendar two zero zero one and one one per cent growth next year higher than many analysts are projecting accounting shift lifts deutsche profits american banker may four two zero zero one frankfurt deutsche bank ag europes largest bank said thursday that firstquarter earnings rose seven fueled by lower taxes and a new accounting rule for derivatives even as revenue from investment banking declined net income climbed to nine two zero million or one six eight a share the results included a gain of two zero eight

rivals in the securities business including goldman sachs group inc reported lower profit in the first quarter deutsche bank said its investment banking revenue declined one another rival reported a similar expectation i expect to see growth from asset management and personal banking this yearseven said helmut hipper who helps manage about five three four billion at union invest gmbh in frankfurt investment banking wont be the main driver deutsche bank shares fell thursday by zero seven five after having risen two eight in early trading without the accounting gain profit was down one seven in the first quarter under a new international accounting standards board rule called ias three nine changes in the value of certain derivatives were included in trading income for the first time if we take away the accounting change profit was down in the first quarter said manfred bleijenberg an analyst at delta lloyd bank in amsterdam who is recommending that clients accumulate shares of deutsche bank the company said its tax bill in the first three months declined three eight germany cut its corporate tax rate this year to two five from four zero however revenue from the banks private client and asset management division declined slightly to one seven nine billion from one eight seven billion and revenue from corporate and investment banking declined to four four seven billion from four five two billion in a letter sent to shareholders thursday mr breuer said we want to expand our market position in all important areas of business in the current financial year he added we expect from this an improvement in our profit situation compared with our competition argentinas strife not over yet financial times may four two zero zero one by thomas catan for the past six months argentinas markets have been dominated by a single question can the country restart its economy in time to avoid a default on its dollars one two eight bn in debt the answer is not yet clear in his first six weeks back in charge of the economy domingo cavallo has done much to improve a bad situation after nearly three years of recession he has transformed a fractious political scene and restored the backing of the international monetary fund his task was complicated by the fact that argentina missed its first quarter fiscal target mr cavallo has taken a range of measures to rein in the burgeoning fiscal deficit to meet the dollars six five bn target agreed with the imf for this year most recently he moved to eliminate virtually all exemptions on value added tax cut dollars nine zero zero m in spending and increased a tax on financial transactions from zero two five per cent to zero four per cent but those steps have only increased concern that argentina will not climb out of recession in spite of his prediction this week that the economy will be growing at a five per cent clip in the last quarter of the year mr cavallos strategy is unconventional to restart growth he has eliminated import tariffs on capital goods to encourage investment as well as cut vat on those items from two one per cent to one zero five per cent he will also unveil a series of competitiveness plans for sectors of industry that have been hurt by the overvaluation of the peso over the past couple of years the aim is to regain competitiveness without breaking the decadeold peg to the dollar which would be disastrous in a country where the vast majority of public and private sector debt is denominated in dollars but investors still question whether the strategy can work and have pushed interest rates up to astronomical levels because of those rates argentina has long been unable to borrow on international markets last week it was forced for the first time to cancel a biweekly auction of treasury bills investors will be watching closely to see if argentina can hold its next scheduled auction on may eight if it cannot then the fears that the country will have to restructure its debt will again grow stronger stoking volatility throughout emerging markets following a brief rally at the start of the year argentinas stock market has again languished but razorthin trading volumes make the countrys merval a poor indicator of market sentiment over the past couple of months it has hovered in a range of four zero zero to four six zero yesterday by midsession the merval slipped six five nine to four one six seven four it is the countrys bonds that investors will be looking at they account for nearly a quarter of the benchmark emerging market debt index and any restructuring could

davis today announced that the california energy commission has signed one two grants and contracts totaling almost nine two million to install energy smart technology in commercial and industrial buildings throughout the state our campaign for conservation and improved energy efficiency will translate into real reductions in the summer when we need it most and beyond governor davis said with these grants in place california will continue to set the national standard for energy efficiency the agreements signed by governor davis will account for about nine three megawatts of projected savings from buildings outfitted with demand responsive building systems technology demand responsive building systems work by using software that automatically dim lights reduce air conditioning use and cut other electrical loads they operate in response to signals from the independent system operator iso or from an electric utility or service provider under the agreements commercial electricity customers will agree to shave peak loads by one zero to three zero percent upon receiving the signal from the iso they will be paid by the iso to curtail electricity load in their buildings in real time in addition to these grants the governor also announced that an additional eight megawatts of electricity would be saved through grants to the kmart corporation kmart will use a two million grant to replace old lighting fixtures with energy efficient ones in its eight five california stores the demand responsive program and the innovative efficiency and renewables program covering the kmart grant are parts of ab nine seven zero which was passed last year the bill is designed to reduce at least two two zero megawatts of peak load by june one two zero zero one the governor has proposed an additional seven zero million in his new demand reduction initiative program that would yield an additional one six zero megawatts in savings from demand responsive building systems for more

following actions in regard to this information i would like to schedule a meeting with you and one or both of todd peterson and tony galt as soon as conveniently possible monday february two six to discuss these and related issues i will ask kathleen to schedule the meeting i would like you to take the lead in following up on a number of matters with southern lng slng and el paso merchant energy epme i think you should do this verbally with followup written confirmation please ensure that we direct all correspondence to the proper corporate entities for example ferc compliance matters should be addressed to el paso merchant energy with a copy to southern lng correspondence directed to southern lng would have to deal with matters related to the quality letter agreement or be in answering requests they direct to us i would like you to keep both eric groves and rod hayslett up to date on all cost related matters so that the cost of service model being developed by rod hayslett and being incorporated into eric groves economics model is as accurate as possible when rod transfers his cos model to eric we should be able to reduce our communications with rod to an asrequired basis you have made some excellent points in your note and i believe we need to follow up on several of them ie spare parts we have used the information supplied by southern lng with the exception of the stripping facilities i think you are right i think we should include your estimates in the cos model however i would not raise this with epmeslng we can discuss it at the time of the trueup filing by slng o m costs in april two zero zero zero slng did add to their fixed om costs but not their variable ones i think the information supplied by slng in late two zero zero zero does pick up increased om costs in the fixed portion of the cos and increased power costs i believe they have deliberately held the variable om costs at the same level as in april two zero zero zero by putting the increase in fixed om i think you should formalize a request to epme copy to slng around dredging maintenance costs broken out by category ie berth channel proposed new turning basin old turning basin etc i cannot find the two seven five zero zero zero zero figure in your fifth point i have never tried to estimate maintenance dredging costs your sixth point is one i had not even thought about and you are right i forgot about the tug pilots i would like you to raise this issue with epme copy to slng if the pilots are on board two four hours per day three six five days per year to escort three zero to four zero vessels past the dock each day then i believe your cost estimate is too low we definitely need to include the epme liquids stripping model economics in the cos model as one key alternative to handle high btu content lng therefore we need to ensure we obtain an asaccurateaspossible assessment of all the costs the model will have the capability to handle several alternatives in this regard i would also like to discuss the following matters at the monday meeting status of the british gas marine study in general status of our initial views on phase i of the british gas marine study plans to deal with early release of study results to slng understanding of the marine consultants conclusions around the twotugescort possibility eg where would the tugs be located would they tie onto the vessels other ramifications of the escort proposal liability risk insurance owners reaction fercimposedrequirement versus uscg uscg preliminary report enron initiatives with the uscg tug owners pilots etc everywhere on the ship side of the unloading flange and other as may be brought forward until monday les james mcmillan zero two two five two zero zero one one zero five zero am to les webberenron_developmentenron_development cc subject re elba island lng terminal cost of service les i have the following comments on your attached cost of service model assume that afudc is essentially interest during construction at a rate of one zero suspect that nine seven three nine one three zero stabilization air or ntwo cost provided by southern lng on april three two zero zero zero does not include spare parts which would increase parts by about two ie one nine five zero zero zero this system would also increase om costs fixed cost zero assume no increase in staff variable om one zero zero zero zero zero swag for maintenance cost electric power by five three zero zero zero zero per year six zero zero zero hp operating one three of time question to slng does their two

incremental capital cost three zero zero zero zero zero yr for three eight air and four four zero zero zero zero for ntwo injection ferc environmental swags for capital cost look ok assume your two seven five zero zero zero zero fixed om cost is for maintenance dredging camera maintenance will be negligible spare parts would only apply to camera surveillance which is negligible stand by tugs cost does not include standby tug pilots add another two zero zero zero zero zero swag per year for them stripping alternative shouldnt we be using el paso energys latest proposal here ie the three four five mm proposal scaled up to five four mm for contingency owners cost and interest during construction plus another zero five to five zero for export facilities with another two four mmhr for om

to develop the proper algorithm to more accurately calculate this information and to work with eric groves on integrating this as a module in erics lng economic evaluation model for the atlantic basin i believe we will need this in order to analyze the proposals that we expect to receive from el paso merchant energy this week i would also like james mcmillan to take a look at the commodity charges and electric power rates for the nitrogen injection air injection and gas liquids stripping cases as well as at the fixed om costs some updating of the estimate information is likely needed i will

commodity futures trading commissionbrief article one two zero eight two zero zero zero the oil daily itemzero zero three four three zero zero seven copyright two zero zero zero gale group all rights reserved copyright two zero zero zero energy intelligence group cftc rules legislation aim to clear up regulation of overthecounter contracts a long process designed to clarify rules for overthe counter otc markets may be drawing to a close after the us commodity futures trading commission cftc the main regulatory agency issued its final framework for a new regime the rules are designed to clear up the legal status of otc products such as swaps while providing more flexible oversight of futures markets and promoting the establishment of independent clearinghouses unveiled late last month the cftc reforms are due to be published in the federal register next week and would take effect six zero days later in midfebruary in the meantime a new president should take office jan two zero cftc experts seem confident that the reforms will survive the changeover saying it is hard for an incoming administration to pull back final regulations there are also signs of progress on a parallel bill supporting the reforms the commodity futures modernization act this was passed by the house in late october but got bogged down in the senate partly due to objections by sen phil gramm rtexas who heads the senate banking committee a compromise was hammered out early this week sources say and the law could still get through this year most likely as an attachment to an appropriations bill legislation would give the cftc measures a stronger legal footing but could require them to be tweaked into line the cftc reforms respond to the explosion of both derivatives markets and electronic trading from equities to natural gas currently electronic exchanges targeting derivatives markets such as the big oilbacked intercontinentalexchange operate in a regulatory gray area the new reforms define futures exchanges more flexibly replacing a onesizefitsall approach with core principles and establishing three tiers of regulation the top tier of recognized futures exchanges rfes matches the current futures markets such as nymex and is the most tightly regulated the second rank of derivatives transaction facilities dtfs comprises institutions requiring looser regulation if for example participation is restricted to big companies the third tier of exempt multilateral transaction execution facilities exempt mtefs escapes most regulation in parallel the cftc has clarified an old ruling removing swaps from regulation the socalled part three five exemption this ends previous restrictions so that otc products traded between two parties can now be fungible standardized and cleared this is part of a drive to turn derivatives into legally recognized products making it hard for one side to renege on an unfavorable contract finally the cftc has moved to encourage the establishment of independent clearinghouses by separating the rules for exchange and clearing functions two startups energyclear and nexclear have already declared their intention to offer such services starting with us gas and power amid concerns about price manipulation the energy industry has been treated as a special case throughout the new framework and does not qualify for the leastregulated exempt mtef category of exchange the cftc reforms also remain fuzzy in certain areas in particular the new part three five exemption for derivatives covers bilateral transactions with multilateral activity still in something of a gray area basically an exchange handling multilateral trades of energy derivatives can apply to the cftc for official status as a commercial dtf if it thinks this will bring credibility and legal standing however a derivatives exchange that does not register with the cftc will not be pursued the new framework offers legal certainty for those who want recognition it is not ruling on the status of those who dont one expert said in practice outfits such as enrononline the web system for direct transactions with enron are in the clear as bilateral platforms dealing in contracts outside cftc jurisdiction intercontinental as a multilateral exchange dealing in standardized swaps could probably remain unregulated but could also register as a dtf to clarify its status nymex in its current form would be an rfe because it entertains noninstitutional traders but the exchange could apply for its planned electronic arm enymex or its traditional floor to become a dtf by limiting activity to institutional users david pike manimoli dinesh for more on this story see the next issue of oil daily sister publication energy network folder

nyse pcg announced that it will acquire a four four four mw wind power generating station near palm springs calif to supply electricity to the western power grid pge subsidiary national energy group is purchasing the plant from seawest wind power inc a san diegobased developer of wind energy plants pge expects the plant to enter commercial operation in the spring of two zero zero one analysis this is just the latest in what appears to be a generation boom for pge corp just over the last two months pge corp also has announced several other generation projects both within california and in other strategic areas of the country national energy group negzero one pge corps unregulated power producer that sells energy on the east coast primarily in new englandzero one is spearheading all of the new generation projects pge corp claims that its goal is for neg to be in a position to contribute three zero percent of earnings for the parent company by two zero zero two thus the accelerate d increase of megawatts under the neg banner certainly is working toward that goal lets take a quick look at the other generation projects that pge corp has announced in addition to the palm springs wind power facility just last week neg announced a longterm tolling agreement with southaven power an affiliate of cogentrix energy under terms of the agreement negstwo zero subsidiary pge energy trading gains rights to the total generation capacity produced at an eight one zero mw naturalgas fueled combined cycle located in mississippi just south of the tennessee border near memphis the deal is noteworthy because it positions neg close to the existing tva and entergy electric substations that will deliver the plants electricity into the regions transmission grid this announcement followed other substantial projects in southern californi a and oregon the five zero zero mw otay mesa generating project located in san diego county is in the final stages of plant siting the project represents the first new power plant built in san diego county in almost three decades and of course will become operational during a time when low supplies in california continue to drive up prices in oregon neg has just submitte d an application to build a new plant in hermiston ore adjacent to an alreadyexisting four seven four mw plant that neg coowns with pacificorp the propose d umatilla generating project will be a combined cycle combustion turbine that will burn natural gas with its fuel supply transported via the negs pacific northwest naturalgas pipeline the growth of neg is a real success for pge corp at a time when itstwo zero regulated subsidiary is struggling pge company the utility that provides natural gas and electric service to approximately one two million people in northern and central california has accumulated about two nine billion in debt pge co buys a great deal of the power it provides to customers on the wholesal e market but because of a retail rate freeze that is still in effect the company has little control over the rates it can charge customers thus over the course of last summer pge co was paying up to one nine cents per kilowatt hour while it was only able to charge its customers on average five cents per kilowatt hour pge remains embroiled in negotiations with the cpuc over its petition to retroactively bill customers for its debt while the regulated pge co could find itself wallowing in the red dependi ng on regulatory rulings neg has soared in the two q of two zero zero zero pge corp report ed second quarter earnings from operations of zero six nine per share on a diluted basis or two five three million which represented a three eight percent over diluted earning s from operations in the same quarter in one nine nine nine much of this success can be attributed to neg which reported two q earnings of three seven million which reflect ed a two three three percent profit increase from the previous years quarter the winning streak continued into three q in which pge corp reported diluted earnings from operations at zero six eight per share or two four eight million and revenues of seven five billion compared with third quarter one nine nine nine revenues of six two billion this constituted a two two percent increase in profit for the parent company again neg performed very well neg contributions rose with diluted earnings from operations of zero one zero per share or three seven million on revenues of five billi on clearly pge corp has benefited greatly from negs ability as antwo zero unregulated subsidiary to sell power outside of the regulated california market thus it is no wonder that although pge corp still considers california to be an attractive market the core driver of its strategy is neg which is able to operate in all lucrative markets as they become deregulated in addition the plant siting process in california historically has been quite restrictive and lengthy which also may explain why pge corp has chosen to focus its generation efforts primarily outside of its own state the siting process in california shows signs of becoming more facile in fact just yesterday the california energy commission adopted emergency regulations to implement the states new sixmonth power plant licensing process the new regulations allow for environmentally advanced power plantszero one such as pges wind power plant in palm springszero one to be licensed and come online more quickly in california currently pge corp has ownership and arrangement interests in more than three zero plants the bulk of which are managed by neg the companys generation portfolio currently consists of seven zero zero zero mw and more than one zero zero zero zero mw in new power plant development and construction is in production as pge corp continues to expand its generation base it probably realizes that current industry intelligence indicates that a company must have at least three zero zero zero zero mw in order to be a formidable player by comparison a company like aepzero one clearly one the top generation companies in the industryzero one has a worldwide generat ing capacity of three eight four zero four mw as neg is pges primary growth vehicle at the prese nt time i think we can expect to see additional generation projects announced by this subsidiary some questions remain will pge corp split its unregulated and regulated operations into two standalone companies as other utilities such as aep and reliant have recently announced i checked with my sources at pge corp and the official company position is that there are no plans to restructure in this way at this time however pge corp does acknowledge the dilemma between asking regulators for the right to bill customers for its regulated companys debt while showing a two six percent profit increase from its unregulated business also what are the prospects for pge corps hydroelectric system accordi ng to prior agreements pge corp was supposed to sell its three eight nine six mwtwo zero hydroelectric system and the company in fact began to do with a bidding process in septem ber one nine nine nine however just last august pge corp petitioned the cpuc to halt this auction process and instead allow the hydroelectric assets to be sold from the regulated pge co to an asofyetunformed unregulated subsidiary for two eight billion pge corps motivation in this proposal is fairly obviou s the unregulated subsidiary could reap substantial profits from the sale of hydropower at market prices in addition according to a sept one five report from dow jones newswires assuming a book value of about seven zero zero million for the hydroelectric system pge corp could take the remaining two one billion to pay off the transition debts incurred by pge co the cpuc and pge corp continue to interface regarding the value of the hydroelectric system and whether or not pge corp should be allowed to sell the assets to an

were basically lit and were going through the testing right now dynegy is lighting two of the four strands of fiber covered by a two zero year lease done earlier this year with level three communications inc lvlt for the most part it is the level three footprint stubbe said about the network that means it connects nearly six zero of the largest cities in the united states dynegy has added to that footprint by doing a few deals to control other capacity he said the us network is connected to dynegys european network by leased subsea capacity transatlantic capacity is so cheap it doesnt make sense to own it he said the company is already moving data on the european network and both ways on the transatlantic routes although dynegy could light the network at ocone nine two its starting at ocfour eight capacity allowing it to move two five gigabits of data a second those circuits can be sold at lower capacities he added the network includes ocfour eight metropolitan area capacity thanks to a deal done a few months ago with telseon inc that deal covers cities like new york chicago san francisco chicago dallas atlanta seattle denver miami and washington dc dynegy is

areas to improve connectivity to buildings with prospective customers recent financial problems in the telecom sector enabled the company to save one zero two zero on some equipment needed to light the network and we had already budgeted low because we thought the equipment was going to come down stubbe said with longhaul bandwidth prices off as much as nine zero since early this year why build a network instead of piecing together cheap routes bought from existing networks its important to show customers you own your own capacity and control it stubbe said stubbe talked to a big customer in dallas recently which had bought capacity from a number of companies that have gone under or are struggling financially the customer wanted to know what dynegy owns what its balance sheet looks like and what its technical capabilities are stubbe said if theres a problem a customer doesnt want to hear that its supplier will have to call a number of other networks to find out whats wrong he said as more and more longhaul networks connect to each other and as metro connectivity improves that wont be a problem the telecom sector will look more like the energy industry where companies lean on each others assets in the natural gas business for example dynegy moves gas on pipelines owned by enron corp ene el paso corp epg and the williams companies wmb among others dynegy will fill its network by going after wholesale customers stubbe said but that field will be wider than traditional telecoms might have thought big banks in new york need considerable capacity he said they almost look like a

separately on both enrononline and dynegy direct traders can only deal with enron and dynegy respectivelytwo zero analysis this is the first step in what may ultimately be a challenging in tegration of the various businesses between dynegy and enron although the merger makes sense for both companies especially considering enrons finan cial instability and its limited options at this juncture it must be ackno wledged that the two companies have very different corporate cultures and the process of conjoining those different cultures may be a major task the companies have developed two distinct approaches to online trading as ill ustrated by their independent electronic exchanges although it will be int eresting to see how the separate exchanges become conjoined and assimilate their two

municipalization votetwo zero news item from reuters two ballot measures aimed at establishing a public power system in san francisco and unplugging utility pacific gas electri c co have gone down in defeat officials said on nov one two two zero analysis the tally of absentee ballots in the nov six municipalization vote in san francisco changed at least part of the outcome in this election as noted in a previous issuealert proposition i which sought to set up a mu nicipal utility district in san francisco and neighboring brisbane was def eated however originally it was believed that the separate measure known as proposition f which would have established a municipal water and power agency in san francisco alone had passed by a slim margin upon counting t he absentee ballots the san francisco department of elections announced th at this measure was defeated by a scant five three three votestwo zero obviously pacific gas electric co is quite pleased with the revised out come of this election in response to the finalized vote representatives f rom the utility said this outcome affirms that there is no strong sentime nt in favor of the takeover of pges distribution system in san francisco there may be some validity to this statement considering that one could argue that with the bankruptcy of pacific gas electric and the recent cal ifornia energy crisis conditions could have favored a promunicipalization vote and yet the measure still failed however lets not forget that it was defeated by only five three three votes which indicates that the issue regarding th e establishment of a public power system in the area is far from overtwo zero the defeat of the municipalization issue in san francisco can be attributed to several factors first it must be acknowledged that pge corp the pa rent company of bankrupt pacific gas electric spent about one million on advertising to defeat the measure however arguably voters responded to cl aims by pacific gas electric co that the municipalization plan was unrea listic the utility claimed that a mud municipal utility would be illequ ipped to handle the complex electricity infrastructure that pacific gas e lectric has managed for years and that a cityrun bureaucracy would not be able to compete with big league energy players in addition the new mud w ould have to purchase pacific gas electrics transmission assets

would like to consider that you and i are to be here too i expect to have a meeting with wade either tomorrow tuesday or after to discuss the suggested plan outlined below and based on if

and seek your opinion for the best reply for wade i look forward for your comments and advise best regards ai here are the salient features meeting with wade the meeting with wade indicated that he is open to suggestions to what needs to be done on the regulatory front he indicated that if ga sees and agrees he would be happy to financeon a semi full time basissuch support from houston his major concern is to satisfy himself that a all what needs to be done on the ga front is being done b manage and maintain an effective team ie those currently employed in bombay and delhi offices just in case of need he mentioned that he is not going to be penny wise and pound foolish given the eight five zero million at stake i informed him that houston shall advise on the best approach as soon as taking stock is complete and generally speaking shall also deliver on what is needed ga needs in india the regulatorygovernment affairs needs in india are in the following five areas a third party sales basically for phase ii output b dealing with the regulatory commission c dealing with mseb the customer e government of india and f ebs the volume and intensity of work however shall differ with the following scenarios namely a enrondpc intends to exit through arbitration b enrondpc intends to renegotiate the contract and c undetermined as of yet here is an assessment of this work load under the two former scenarios arbitration renegotiation third party sales basically for phase ii output lowmedium high dealing with the regulatory commission medium high dealing with mseb the customer medium high government of india and high high ebs medium medium it is surprising to mention that most colleagues here say that enrondpc seems to be taking the arbitration route although that renegotiation in the sense of renegotiate stabilize then take hit on equity and exit is the best way it is more surprising however that no one can speak with any degree of certainty on where the ship is going in this context a riskaverse person shall take the undetermined scenario as equal to renegotiation while a risktaker shall take the undetermined as equal to arbitration personal it is clear that the current personal here shall need support from houston in the renegotiation scenario on a semi full time basis short of that a visit every six weeks may be adequate as the current team here will be working under legalcommercial suggested approach continue understanding the details of the outstanding regulatory tasks for the coming three to four days if the above opinion is still the same then the suggested communication to wade preferably from you is if there is renegotiation then ga shall send the required personpersons on a semifull time basis if arbitration then ga shall be available on as needed basis caveat it is not clear what does rmcdonald wants to see on the ground to tilt the suggested approach above one way or another forwarded by amr ibrahimenron_development on

india progress report one rick this is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations and short talks with the various colleagues in india team i do have a meeting with wade tomorrow june one three th to understand his requests of support from ga while i do not expect much i shall communicate to wade the standing policy of ga namely ga shall provide the required support notwithstanding this mandate i shall communicate it in a manner to give houston the final say in the context of regulatory support there two important areas for ga contribution they are a dealing with the regulatory commission merc and b third party sales it is likely that india shall need a week per month most conducted from houston but may include a visit to bombay the feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the ppa and exit india but see point five below it is the understanding that there are teams in london that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation to transfer them to mseb as per the contract mseb has to agree on the valuation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process it is noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market basis but rather on accounting basis as most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely route around six zero renegotiation is not discussed much hastily added however renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated in singapore the other day in the lenders meeting they also want enron to complete phase ii which we are refusing if renegotiation is to take place its crux will be the reduction in energy and capacity costs to both phases and finding offtaker to phase ii one four zero zero mw kit and caboodle ntpc or ptc are the likely parties to assume such responsibility of course we are trying to avoid any commercial risks associated with marketing this power whether we accept it or not every issue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and solved the decision making process here is entirely dependent on houston highest level that is directly from rmcdonald and js the fact that both of them did not visit india and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned as a minus point perhaps this point should be communicated to them as mentioned above ga contribution could be in two areas namely dealing the regulatory commission merc and third party sales starting with the later third party sales it is perhaps the most important point in the renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment incidentally enrons commitment in the project is between zero six five and zero eight two five billionwith bdepending on what to include and exclude ironing the issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of renegotiation but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added as for dealing with merc it an ongoing basis particularly that merc is seeking to expand its jurisdiction in favor mseb at every through of the dice i shall keep you posted with progress meanwhile please

instructions image image april nine two zero zero one pacific gas electric co declares bankruptcy by will mcnamara director electric industry analysis pacific gas electric co nyse pcg the utility unit of pgocorp on friday filed for reorganization under chapter one one bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of california in san francisco the company said it is taking this action in light of its uncollected energy costs which are now increasing by more than three zero zero million per month continuing cpuc decisions that economically disadvantage the company and the now unmistakable fact that negotiations with gov gray davis and his representatives are going nowhere pacific gas electric co reportedly has more than nine billion in uncollected costs for wholesale power purchases neither pgocorp nor any of its other subsidiaries including its national energy group have filed for chapter one one reorganization or are affected by the utilitys filing analysis despite the fact that pacific gas electric cos bankruptcy filing has been in the making for several months and that its financial insolvency appeared inevitable the actual filing for chapter one one protection on friday caught many by surprise including californias top officials ironically the utilitys one three million customers may end up being the least impacted by the bankruptcy as pacific gas electric co will remain in the business of providing power while it works its way through bankruptcy court however there is little doubt that the bankruptcy filing of californias largest utility will spark many reverberations throughout the state and across the country the full impact of which is not presently known there naturally is a great deal of industry press surrounding this major news so i wont waste time regurgitating information that is being widely disseminated rather i will focus on what i believe to be some of the key elements of this story one the bankruptcy was announced the day after it became clear to pgothat the state of california would not be purchasing its transmission assets at a price that pgobelieves the assets to be worth in addition a new rate increase approved by the governor could not be used to repay any of pacific gas electric cos existing debts the night before the bankruptcy filing gov davis delivered a televised address to the state in which he indicated that the rate increases would be contingent on pgoselling the transmission assets to the state in other words if pgoagreed to the states price for the transmission assets a portion of the rate increase would be used to alleviate the utilitys subsequent debts the inside word is that pacific gas electric co was finally driven to its bankruptcy decision due to disagreements with gov davis regarding the price of the transmission assets which could be anywhere from three billion to nine billion officially pacific gas electric co said that its negotiations with the state were going nowhere the cpuc had previously approved rate increases of up to four six percent for the customers of sce and pacific gas electric co but clearly stipulated that none of this added revenue could be used to pay off existing debt in his statewide address on the eve of the bankruptcy gov davis reluctantly announced an additional rate increase for nonresidential customers that would average about two six five percent davis had fiercely resisted any form of a rate increase to accommodate pacific gas electric cos debt the official pgoresponse to both increases was that they were insufficient to pay off existing debts of the utility operation two pgocorp and other nonutility subsidiaries are not impacted by the bankruptcy measure at least for now due to a shrewd financial restructuring that was approved by ferc a few months ago see one one two zero one issue alert for more information highprofit subsidiaries such as national energy group and pgogas transmission northwest corp were placed into a specialpurpose bankruptcy remote entity known as gtn holdings llc consequently these nonregulated subsidiaries along with the parent corporation may not be impacted by the utilitys bankruptcy filing the us federal bankruptcy judge ultimately may take a closer look at how profits were divided among the parent operation and other nonregulated subsidiaries but for the time being only pacific gas electric co has declared bankruptcy three power suppliers still owed money by pgocould likely never get paid much of pacific gas electric cos nine billion debt is owed to power suppliers that sold power to the utility over the last year or so with the onset of lengthy legal proceedings it becomes more unlikely that these power suppliers will be paid what they are owed any time soon consequently power suppliers owed more than one zero zero million by pacific gas electric co also saw their stocks drop as a reaction to the bankruptcy announcement according to a report in reuters duke energy nyse duk was down two six five or six two five percent at three zero seven five dynegy corp nyse dyn was off two five eight or five zero seven percent at four eight three four williams companies nyse wmb was two two six or five four percent lower at three nine six zero and reliant energy nyse rei lost two seven zero or five nine five percent to four two six five in addition there is the real question of whether or not such power suppliers will be willing to provide power used by a bankrupt company even if the state of california remains involved as the buying intermediary for its part pgocorp chairman bob glynn said that the utility subsidiary intends to eventually pay all our debt in full but he did not report a specific figure in addition to the power suppliers banks that have provided loans to pacific gas electric co such as bank of america wells fargo and jp morgan chase could all be impacted by the bankruptcy pacific gas electric cos preliminary bankruptcy filing lists its top creditor as bank of new york to which it owes more than two two billion although some payments may be made after years of litigation such lenders and bondholders may be forced to write off billions of dollars that were previously advanced to pacific gas electric co as losses four the blame game is in full force davis and state regulators have repeatedly blamed outofstate generators for price gouging and federal regulators for failing to impose wholesale rate caps on electricity prices also gov davis has issued harsh words against pge over the weekend davis appeared on two nationally televised news programs to berate pgofor awarding an estimated five zero million in bonuses and raises to about six zero zero zero midlevel managers and support staff on the eve of the utilitys bankruptcy filing management at pgois just focused upon padding their own pockets not in discharging their duty to serve their many customers in california davis reportedly said earlier davis had previously issued a statement saying pgomanagement is suffering from two afflictions denial and greed in addition california regulators have criticized ferc for not implementing wholesale price caps in the western region which they believe would help to stabilize the market in california us sen dianne feinstein said that it is inexcusable that ferc has refused to intervene and provide temporary stability and reliability through the use of wholesale price caps feinstein vowed to introduce legislation to force federally mandated price caps for the entire western region for its part ferc refused to take responsibility for the california crisis saying instead that pacific gas electric cos bankruptcy filing was the unfortunate result of a massive failure by policymakers at all levels pgoblames decisions made by the cpuc and gov davis that it believes undermined its ability to return to financial viability and recover its uncollected costs specifically pgoblames the california government for not allowing it to recover prior wholesale power costs through recent rate increases which essentially has kept the utility in a debt situation pgoalso believed that the governor was not moving quickly enough to reach an agreement regarding the sale of pges transmission system to the state consumer groups continue to lambaste the utility and its parent company which they claim has three zero billion in available capital that could have been used to pull its subsidiary out of debt five could the bankruptcy filing of sce be far behind the secondlargest utility in california continues to maintain that it intends to avoid bankruptcy and it believes it can work out a comprehensive solution to our current crisis however because the two utilities have been so closely linked through the states energy crisis pges decision to declare bankruptcy certainly raises the odds that sce will eventually follow suit in fact moodys investors service is reporting that pacific gas and electric cos bankruptcy increases the possibility of an sce bankruptcy filing further moodys is reporting that numerous creditor groups particularly the small generators have become impatient with the time that it has taken to advance settlement discussions with the state of california thereby increasing the prospects for an involuntary petition by a group of creditors on april six the day of pacific gas electric cos bankruptcy filing shares of sce tumbled four two nine or nearly three four percent to finish trading at eight three five surprisingly sce shares jumped about two zero zero by midmorning on april nine to trade at about one zero zero zero the reason for the increase is not fully known although sce continues to remain involved in negotiations with gov davis regarding its own outstanding debt six this is just the start of a long drawn out legal process the electric utilities that previously declared bankruptcy including el paso electric public service company of new hampshire and el paso electric all found themselves embroiled in legal proceedings for several years thus although we may not know the ultimate outcome for pacific gas electric cos bankruptcy proceedings we do know that the company will be essentially consumed with litigation and a thorough investigation of its financial records for the foreseeable future federal bankruptcy judge dennis montali of san francisco has been assigned the pgocase montali will have the ultimate power to approve or reject any plan for how pgoreorganizes or arranges to repay its debt several positive elements of the process that might work to pges advantage is that the utility will now be held accountable to only one individual judge montali pacific gas electric co will no longer have to appease several regulatory entities across state and federal lines second by the time that the bankruptcy proceedings are completed market dynamics hopefully will have improved and californias supply problem should be resolved consequently pacific gas electric co could eventually rise again like the phoenix out of its ashes and emerge as a much stronger company than it is

california a secret deal by jeff gerth and lowell bergman uke energy a powergenerating company accused of overcharging customers millions of dollars during californias yearold energy crisis has secretly offered gov gray davis a deal that it hopes will solve its legal problems while helping to calm the states chaotic electricity markets the proposed settlement outlined in documents prepared in march by dukes lawyers calls for an end to various state investigations private lawsuits and state complaints to federal authorities accusing duke of overcharging in return duke would make an unspecified appropriate payment but admit no wrongdoing duke is committed to sharing pain and expediting highlevel confidential discussions that would embrace the governors political and public relations needs according to the documents which were given to the new york times by someone who wanted the issue aired publicly governor davis acknowledged the secret discussions in an interview in san francisco yesterday and said he hoped to meet with more generators soon but he insisted that none of the companies would escape a substantial payment because he said they have penalized the state with excessive prices my general approach to the energy companies is that you have already charged the utilities a five zero percent credit penalty for the power they were buying from you mr davis said so youre going to have to have a very substantial reduction in what the companies are owed mr davis said duke had walked in with a number of demands including an end to state inquiries but that that was not likely to happen were not about to call off the dogs said the governor a democrat who will seek reelection next year duke based in charlotte nc is a major investor in californias wholesale electricity market having spent more than one billion since the state opened its generating plants to outside operators in one nine nine six it is also near the top of the list of companies accused of overcharging duke has been ordered by federal regulators to justify or refund two zero million in disputed charges this year an amount that is thirdhighest among federally regulated companies in the california market by entering secret negotiations with mr davis and being the first generator to settle duke could gain a publicrelations advantage in much the same way that the liggett group donned a white hat by being the first company to open talks with the state governments in the tobaccolitigation wars weve just simply tried to be part of the solution richard b priory dukes chairman and chief executive said in an interview adding that the company was offering ideas and throwing in suggestions publicly mr davis has disparaged outofstate electricity generators before and after he began talking with them privately in an interview two weeks ago with the los angeles times he called the generators the biggest snakes on the planet earth for their pricing practices californias electricity costs have risen to about two eight billion last year from seven billion in one nine nine nine by some estimates they could approach seven zero billion this year zero one two zero zero zero for every resident the state has stepped in to buy power for financially crippled utilities including pacific gas and electric which is now in bankruptcy courttwo zero the davis administration has struck power deals with companies like duke in hopes of securing a stable and affordable source of power to pay those bills mr davis is seeking the largest municipal bond issue in american history one two billion although some state officials privately estimate that the final amount will be higher the governor hopes the bond issue will eventually take the states taxpayers off the hook but how those costs are allocated among ratepayers utilities and generators and whether the bond issue can even succeed remain unanswered questions a major impediment to resolving the electricity crisis according to state officials utility executives and economists is the secrecy surrounding the administrations negotiations several republicans have sued the davis administration to learn the terms of specific contracts entered into by the state on monday the administration released a six seven page financial analysis including its most detailed disclosure about the overall costs of state electricity contracts last week republicans blocked legislation that mr davis says he needs to pass the bond issue the bill could come up for a vote later this week the thing that has hindered governor davis the most among the legislative ranks is the demand for secrecy over the negotiations and the agreements that have been reached said senator joseph l dunn a democrat from santa ana and the chairman of a select committee investigating the price spikes mr davis in the interview said there were legitimate commercial reasons for keeping contract terms confidential the political uncertainty has spilled over into the markets where the bonds would have to be sold the states credit rating while still solid is slipping already companies that do business with california like duke are citing the states creditworthiness as a reason for charging higher prices in their dealing with the state though the state has stepped in as buyer since february the federal energy regulatory commission recently ordered generators to justify high prices in california this year or pay one two five million in refunds the companies zero one including duke reliant energy dynegy inc and the williams company zero one deny any wrongdoing and cite the states credit situation as one reason for the high prices mr priory the duke chairman said that resolution of credit issues would lead his company to drop the socalled credit premium it now charges on power sales as of march seven duke was owed more than one zero zero million by the states power managers documents show in its confidential submission to mr davis and his aides duke said it would forgive an appropriate amount of certain receivables or make an appropriate payment based upon a methodology that fairly represents its share of alleged overchargestwo zero the documents do not give an amount but dukes two zero zero zero annual report shows that its wholesale energy division had written off one one zero million for power sales to california that had not been collected even with that writeoff the units profits before taxes doubled from one nine nine nine to two zero zero zero and quadrupled for the first quarter of this year dukes preliminary global settlement template of march nine goes on duke is committed to sharing pain with state and others on a fair and equitable basis without admitting legal liability because duke has done nothing illegal duke says that much of its california power was sold last year on the forward markets not the more volatile and higherpriced spot markets but mr priory also noted in his interview that at least one zero percent was sold for whatever the market price is on march two three dukes lawyer at the request of mr daviss legal affairs secretary forwarded to the governors office additional information about pending litigation involving duke and its power sales in california the documents show that a top duke priority is the prompt suspension of state investigations lowering of rhetoric and stay of state litigation as well as the withdrawal of staterelated claims at the federal energy commission also in march the operators of the states power grid told the federal energy regulatory commission that wholesale electricity prices in california were more than six billion above competitive prices over the previous one zero months duke has questioned the methodology of that submission and wants the claim withdrawn the inquiries of concern to duke include those being conducted by the office of the attorney general william lockyer and the california public utilities commissiontwo zero barry p goode the governors legal affairs secretary says he subsequently referred dukes lawyer to the attorney generals office the two state agencies say that their inquiries are continuing sandra michioku a spokeswoman for mr lockyer said our investigation is ongoing loretta lynch the president of the utility commission said in a telephone interview yesterday the public utilities commission has not been involved in any settlement discussions with generators and our investigations into overcharges and withholding are ongoing and strong the duke documents

Trading Simulation,we are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system ubswenergy is ready for launch on the week of feb one one which is the week following the anticipated enronubs closing date of friday feb eight to assist in this process we are planning an online trading simulation for thursday february seven from zero nine zero zero to one one zero zero cst it is planned to include all traders originators midbackoffice staff and it teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading purpose of the simulation the simulation will test our live trading environment restricted to internal access only and will test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes including credit risk legal operations etc provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to ubs staff visiting next week nature of the simulation the simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and midbackoffice functions credit legal risk operations and other groups profile tests for external customers roleplayed by originators profile tests for internal users traders backoffice etc data and process checking as completed transactions flow through midbackoffice systems traders and originators traders will be managing their individual books and associated products although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day both physical and financial will be available during the simulation each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties credit limits etc will be tested during the simulation information technology will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation after the simulation is over will work with the relevant groups to test the tradedata in various systems and risk books will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete next steps traders and originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system originators will be assigned specific roles you should expect to receive an email andor handout on or before wednesday feb six ubswenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation summary this simulation is an important step towards relaunching our trading business we appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of ubs warburg energy and the ubswenergy trading platform if you have any questions comments suggestions or ideas

during this time eric worked on a variety of projects requiring a diverse set of skills in all cases he quickly grasped the scope and context of the problems at hand while some direction was given in each case eric was often charged with developing the approach details independently and he executed the tasks very effectively one major project for the summer was to develop a webbrowserbased trading simulation platform tsp the tsp would create user accounts require user logons post simulated market information post simulated commidity prices accept and execute buy and sell transactions for users and track user account information such as positions order history and buying power the tsp would allow for the use of human users as well as software agent simulated commidity prices could be histroical prices ficticious calculated prices or bidoffer prices based on some update algorithms the primary goal was to create a framework to test different udpate algorithms and trading strategies eric immediately arranged for the appropriate reference materials to develop the database and associated software infrastructure in short order a simple site was up for users to create accounts and begin trading commodities the project ended before extensive algorithm evaluation could begin however the tsp goes a long way to making such evaluations possible other projects included the development of forecast models for motion picture box office revenues advertising media placement prices and longdistance voice telephony prices in many of the cases data were scarce as were definitive instructions eric analyzed the problem to develop a focused approach always in consultation and discussion with others but never with handholding or intense oversight his coworkers and immediate supervisor quickly developed confidence in erics ability to take general direction and achieve productive results such confidence and ability is crucial in an environment with limited

company to provide additional information about the partnerships which enron said were offbalance sheet financing vehicles used to hedge against fluctuations in the market in a conference call held monday to discuss investor concerns about the sec investigation and related matters lay said there was a chinese wall in place to protect the interest of enron shareholders the procedures were rigorously followed lay said in previous filings with the sec enron said the terms of the transactions with the partnerships were reasonable compared to those which could have been negotiated with unrelated third parties fastow resigned from the partnerships which were known as ljm cayman lp and ljmtwo coinvestments lp in late july the company also is involved in other offbalance sheet

alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing fastow to create and run the partnerships enron officials also addressed concerns that investors had about the potential need to issue additional enron stock under certain circumstances for example if both enrons stock and credit rating fall to certain levels the company would need to issue additional shares to the partnerships diluting the holdings of current shareholders enron officials declined to say how much dilution would occur under a worstcase scenario however the officials said they doubted there would be a need to

organized by andrew s fastow enrons chief financial officer and that enron had whittled one two billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a one two billion note it had received from the partnership shareholder equity now stands at nine five billion the limited partnership called ljmtwo and fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved enron assets and stock the journal reported lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed a shareholder lawsuit charging that enrons directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in texas state court many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them analyst say investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that enron has guarded financial information making it difficult to analyze the companys complex web of businesses and many are not confident that all the bad news has been released analyst m carol coale who follows enron and other energy companies for prudential securities in houston downgraded enron to a hold from a buy rating monday out of such frustration coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of enron but bob christensen energy analyst with first albany corp said that despite enrons recent difficulties the bulk of the business remains strong i continue to tell investors that seven zero of this companys business is growing at a two six rate and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on he said investors are panicking because of a bad news story that doesnt reflect reality said jon kyle cartwright senior energy analyst with the raymond james associates brokerage firm in st petersburg fla they are the worlds largest energy trader and they are very good at

denver qb brian griese made my downgrade list in the upgrades downgrade article according to john clayton of espn grieses shoulder injury is a separation of the ac joint in his right clavicle he took a pain killing shot and finished the game unfortunately his status for this weeks game against san diego is in doubt at this point coach mike shanahan is saying it will be a couple of days before they decide what theyre doing ive copied the entire story below if youd like more details sounds like this victory could be one of those career turning point games for him griese describing how he knew he was about to get slammed in the pocket because he could hear the crowd hold its breath is classic ill keep an eye on it for you as this shakes out joe from the article httpespngocomnflnewstwo zero zero zero one one one four eight seven six eight nine eight html denver brian griese had a secret mike shanahan knew because he was the head coach griese knew because he had the pain piercing in the middle of his right shoulder his teammates didnt know what went on behind closed doors in mondays dramatic two seven two four broncos victory over the raiders at mile high stadium all his teammates knew was that he had injured his right shoulder on an illadvised run out of bounds minutes into the first quarter griese retreated to the locker room with a trainer but wasnt missed the raiders had an one one play fieldgoal drive that lasted six minutes teammates saw griese trot back to the field warm up and miss only five plays they didnt hear that griese had separated his right clavicle and ac joint and needed a paindeadening shot to finish the final three quarters this is not a game i wanted to miss and i was going to do anything possible to get in the game and help my team win griese said i was going to do it it was just the will to play and the will to win and i wasnt going to come out an hour after the game broncos players were surprised that the man who ran their huddle had a busted wing his performance was john elwaylike for courage but it also leaves the broncos uncertain if they will have griese available as a starting quarterback for sundays game against the san diego chargers we wont know for a couple of days the exact extent of the injury but hes such a competitor shanahan said hes been like that since hes been here he wants to play and sometimes you have to be cautious to make sure he doesnt further hurt himself thats the kind of guy he is rod smith is among the many broncos who have grown to love this guy last year was different in the preseason it was supposed to be bubby bristers team but shanahan named griese the starter veterans didnt feel totally comfortable with him griese didnt feel comfortable bossing around a group of players who didnt take to him brians the one to lead us smith said i think it would have hurt him more just sitting there and watching rather than being out there playing with the shoulder the way it was whatever he does he doesnt surprise me hes the best quarterback in the nfl i know the raiders think rich gannon is we think brian is griese told his offensive players that he didnt have too much zip on the ball they accepted it as just humility i wasnt throwing the ball as well i have been griese said some of the balls just died at that point it was just your will to play your will to win i wasnt coming out of the game griese was two two ofthree two for two two one yards with a separated shoulder hed throw passes and hear as well as feel his shoulder popping in and out i knew there was something wrong with it but they assured me that i couldnt do any further damage griese said it was just whether i could handle the pain being injured didnt make griese shy away from contact several times he took shots from raiders defenders that bounced him to the frozen mile high stadium grass once cornerback eric allen charged untouched from the blindside griese ducked as allen hit him shoulder high believe it or not the reason i kind of ducked when he came in is that i heard the crowd and the crowd held their breath and i could hear that griese said i said to myself well somebody must be ready to hit me talk about homefield advantage griese has never had an injury like this he has played two seasons with a torn labrum problem in his shoulder that requires surgery but this was much more painful griese remembered a pass to rod smith along the sideline that was a big play he had to make just an armthrough pass it was agonizing he threw a skinny post to ed mccaffrey that left mccaffrey vulnerable to a hit on the chin i apologized to him for that because the ball kind of floated on me and i didnt have any zip on the ball griese said griese said the feeling of his shoulder popping in and out was different we knew it was something that was hurting him we knew he was banged up fullback howard griffith said thats how it is when youve got a job to do still the story told after the game amazed

turn it to their advantage aides said bush and vice president dick cheney are dogged by their backgrounds as former texas oilmen from the moment cheney argued for more oil and gas production to satisfy the energy needs of the united states democrats portrayed bush and him as beholden to special interests the white house and republicans are in the three five percent end of public opinion on this a top democratic leadership aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said this week its a loser every day for the republicans with that in mind daschle and sen jeff bingaman the new mexico democrat who heads the senates energy and natural resources committee plan to have a comprehensive energy bill ready by the end of july it will be a full scale alternative to the bushcheney program unveiled in may the first floor disputes on energy policy could occur as early as next week when the senate debates the spending bill for the interior department republicans and white house lobbyists will have their hands full fending off democratic amendments to match the house bans on offshore drilling near florida beaches and on national monument lands the white house helped defuse some of the oilexploration dispute earlier this week by scaling back its plans to drill in the gulf of mexico but huge disagreements remain over drilling in alaskas arctic national wildlife refuge a centerpiece of bushs energy plan some democrats intend to offer an amendment to the interior spending bill that would prohibit drilling in the refuge democrats also want to highlight energy conservation and lower emissions of pollutants that contribute to global warming one proposal which combines conservation and anti pollution goals would raise gasmileage requirements for sport utility vehicles the national academy of sciences is studying fuel economy standards and is expected to issue recommendations to congress later this month the energy debate also splits senate republicans giving daschle extra manpower to challenge bush democrats can count on new england republicans such as lincoln chafee of rhode island and olympia snowe and susan collins both of maine to back several democratic initiatives sen john mccain rariz who already has opposed bush on the patients bill of rights and campaign finance legislation also has said he favors more conservation measures than the white house proposes hell be very prominent in cobbling a centrist coalition on the issue said marshall wittman a senior fellow at the conservative hudson institute research center and a political adviser to mccain you can already see the outlines of that proposal encouragement of conservation some exploration but everything is environmentally friendly the white house already has reacted to the criticism of its energy policies its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spending for renewable energy but bush restored some of the money later he also has paid more attention to energy conservation indicating support for spending on efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget but the president is not backing away from his position that the united states needs to become less dependent on foreign oil and that white house officials say requires more oil and gas exploration in the united states the energy plan bush sent to congress last week would authorize drilling in the alaskan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to pay for research into alternative energy sources in addition to public disapproval of his stands on the environment and energy the president is losing the sense of urgency that initially accompanied his energy proposals rolling blackouts in california are on the wane gasoline prices are falling and last week john browne the chief executive of bp oil dismissed bushs call for new oil refineries that gives democrats a chance to seize the issue and attack the president without competing pressure from the public for quick solutions its a target of opportunity said burdett loomis a political scientist at the university of kansas and an expert on the senate like the patients bill of rights on which the public sided with democrats energy right now is lowhanging fruit he said,05:35:00,"Yes

zero out wr robert ferguson ankle and cb sammy davis ankle both did nottwo zero practice tuesday for the aggies and were listed as questionabletwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q i sent you a question last week about the intensity and hate that thetwo zero horns didnt have for the ou game and was wondering if coach brown a thin kstwo zero he made a mistake by having the players take the ou game so lightly withtwo zero comments like we dont hate ou and its just another game on t hetwo zero schedule and b is that the attitude that will prevail going into the two zero azero two game and in future ou gamestwo zero zero nine joe rushingtwo zero zero nine zero nine brown mack brown and his staff are not an inyourface group of coach estwo zero players say that they are treated with respect make no mistake they know two zero their jobs are on the line every day in practice they know if they dont two zero perform in practice they will be replaced but ss greg brown said that mac ktwo zero brown has never given a hell hath no fury locker room talk before durin gtwo zero or after a game greg brown said that mack simply states whats on the line two zero for each game and expects the players to find their own way to motivatetwo zero themselves mack has said that as well he said he asks players what works two zero for them best whether it be the toughlove approach or the straightforward two zero approach he has said constant yelling wears off so he doesnt play head two zero games with his team according to coaches and players from his time as ou two zero offensive coordinator back in one nine eight four mack used to be a much more inyourfac etwo zero kind of coach yelling at players to get them going coach barry switzer ha dtwo zero to tone him down brown said he has learned that you cant be negative with two zero players that you have to treat them with respect i dont know that you wi lltwo zero hear him talk about hating other teamstwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q looking at the haul of recruits texas already has commitments from istwo zero there an area of need not being addressed it appears that this is quite a two zero haul of offensive linemen so it looks like a lot of redshirts in the makin gtwo zero if he signs what will quan cosby be asked to do doesnt he have a twintwo zero brother and is that a factor on where he signs when all is said and done two zero where do you think this class will rank come signing day in february andtwo zero which of the potential signees not orally committed will most determine two zero where that rank ends up also with sneezy beltran coming off a redshirt ye artwo zero and from what i am reading an impressive one at that what do you see in t hetwo zero future for cedric benson what about the returning rbs such as ivan william stwo zero kenny hayter et al is the abundance of talent at rb a good thing or too two zero much of a good thing and one last thing is anyone looking to transfer aft ertwo zero the seasontwo zero zero nine roy cassastwo zero zero nine zero nine brown quarterbacks and linemen on both sides of the ball control th etwo zero game so you can never have enough of those positions ut is filling itstwo zero needs nicely with the commitments that it has the player that can probably two zero make the biggest difference is tommie harris of killeen ellison perhaps th etwo zero best defensive tackle in the country uts class is shaping up as a top one zero two zero nationally again if harris comes it will climb but as is the case with two zero all of this recruiting hype its just that hype who knows if cedrictwo zero benson will play next year he has to come down here in the heat of august two zero and prove to the coaches that hes better than kenny hayter ivan williams two zero victor ike and sneezy beltran i would say bensons chances are good if som etwo zero of those guys dont toughen up and let loose but time will tell as far as two zero guys looking to transfer there arent any rumblings yet stay tunedtwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine imagetwo zero zero nine uts road uniforms two zero zero nine zero nine q i can say this because i am a graduate of the university of texas i thinktwo zero the longhorn football team has the ugliest uniform in all of collegetwo zero football when the horns play on the road they have too much white and not two zero enough color they wear the ugliest black football shoes and those long sol idtwo zero white socks are atrocious it looks like each player can dress anyway hetwo zero desires there is no uniformity in the look some players dont even wear two zero socks at all it seems two zero zero nine zero nine the coaches let each player express their own individuality and i think theytwo zero play like a bunch of individuals instead of as a team coach mcwilliams let two zero this trend start and it has continued through the current regime with poor two zero results the orange home jerseys are not the right color orange and they two zero look cheap i wish coach brown would adopt a true burnt orange color i wis htwo zero he would change the helmets to the same burnt orange color with a whitetwo zero traditional longhorn logo on each side and a white facemask shirttailstwo zero should be tucked in and each player should be dressed the same fewtwo zero indicators of individuality should be allowed the longhorns look ragtag an dtwo zero slow on the field if they would improve their image their play mighttwo zero improve as well two zero zero nine john robert pharr waco texastwo zero zero nine zero nine brown that seemed to be more of a comment than a question but everyo ne istwo zero entitled to their own opinion i dont know about the burnt orange helmets two zero that might be a little too much of a good thingtwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q do you think that the loss to ou will hurt our recruiting class i k nowtwo zero that we tend to compete for the same players and that they had their recrui tstwo zero at the cotton bowl since they were the home team two zero zero nine t franks austin two zero zero nine zero nine brown it appears that oklahoma is making some serious inroads on ut two zero recruiting territory at least for the one zero or so recruits the longhorns stil ltwo zero hope to get orally committed namely tommie harris the defensive tackle o uttwo zero of killeen ellison texas needs to take care of business on friday to keep two zero the sooners from stepping up their pitch for some of the noncommitted kids uttwo zero is hoping to signtwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q the lack of respect texas is getting leading up to the azero two game is two zero disturbing i understand that the horns were crushed against ou and also ha dtwo zero an earlyseason loss against stanford on the road but even with the stats two zero from those two losses the horns have one of the nations top five defensive two zero units plus we are playing at home and are riding the confidence of fivetwo zero consecutive winstwo zero zero nine derrick jackson coppell texastwo zero zero nine zero nine brown well texas is a five one two point favorite so i dont know where th etwo zero lack of respect comes from but i think people are lukewarm about ut becaus etwo zero the longhorns havent had a chance to show how much theyve improved agains ttwo zero a quality opponent until now the longhorns need to go out and grind the two zero aggies into the ground to get the nations attention and i think they will two zero im predicting texas three one azero two two one two zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine imagetwo zero zero nine quentin jammer two zero zero nine zero nine q what are the key matchups in fridays gametwo zero zero nine lucas harringtontwo zero zero nine zero nine brown in think the best matchups will be mlb deandre lewis against a mstwo zero corps of running backs namely jamar toombs also keep an eye on quentin two zero jammer against azero two wr robert ferguson lewis basically said this week that iftwo zero you hit toombs in the mouth hell fold so that immediately inspires some two zero interest in that matchup jammer also had a lot to say about fergusontwo zero stating that if two zero zero nine zero nine fergusons ankle wasnt one zero zero percent it might not even be a close matchu ptwo zero if hes five zero percent or seven five percent that wont cut it jammer said jammer two zero did say that he thought a healthy ferguson was better than kansas state wr two zero quincy morgan jammer and ferguson are both big roughly six one and two zero five pounds two zero should be fun to watchtwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q is texas azero two a legitimate passing team after all these years of try ing totwo zero air out the ball and not being able totwo zero zero nine stephen torrencetwo zero zero nine zero nine brown i think so it seems hard to believe after branndon stewart an d alltwo zero the hype about building a bigtime passing offense the past several years two zero its finally hit college station the aggies run fourwide even fivewide two zero they have trick plays and robert ferguson bethel johnson and chris taylor two zero are bigtime receivers and two five yearold qb mark farris is the gritty leader two zero and six zero percent passer they have been looking for i think it will be a dece nttwo zero test for texas owner of the nations no one ranked pass efficiency defense two zero zero nine zero nine zero nine q why does texas keep throwing that out pattern and allowing chris sim ms totwo zero be intercepted for touchdownstwo zero zero nine margie phillipstwo zero zero nine zero nine brown ill let mack brown answer that one its not the same pass or wetwo zero would throw it out of the playbook were not that dumb that was histwo zero comment tuesday night on his radio showtwo zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q do you think chris simms is ready for the pressure of the texas azero two gametwo zero zero nine deginald frankstwo zero zero nine zero nine brown i think so simms seemed to grow in confidence after the kansas two zero game getting the chance to pull the longhorns out of a one four zero hole aftertwo zero throwing a pick for a td really seemed to give him a positive jolt normall ytwo zero he would have been pulled at that point for major applewhite at least he two zero would have been pulled early in the season a la louisianalafayette so two zero getting the chance to play an entire game seemed to help i believe simms two zero will be fine on friday he must feel good about his deep ball to roy willia mstwo zero after the success they had at kansas i would expect to see a lot more of two zero that creating room for hodges mitchell to run against a depleted azero two fron ttwo zero seven two zero zero nine zero nine zero nine zero nine q i heard that this is only the ninth time that texas and texas azero two a re bothtwo zero ranked coming into this game that doesnt seem righttwo zero zero nine brock marshaltwo zero zero nine zero nine brown it doesnt seem right but it is of the one zero seven times these two te amstwo zero have met including this year

the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at ferc taking action without including them in the decision making process although the panel notice showed that five state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that two seven state commissioners were there and ready to claim their one five minutes of fame it was a long morning i will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts approximately three five to four zero of the commenters were supportive of ferc and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts most of these comments came from the midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support everyone else was fairly verbal against ferc primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that ferc was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens in particular the commissioners from maryland and north carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric while many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend sarah novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis heres some individual comments catherine rileymarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the maryland commission and immediately implied that ferc was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department she then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you ferc backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record it went on like this for about one five minutes the good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her sam ervinnorth carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an rto that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an rto and i bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of ferc his comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor arnetta mcraedelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are she also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order rory mcminnnew mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the ferc commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were carl woodcaliforniatried to portray himself and california as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the washington commission echoeing his comments he delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverferc should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc glen thomaspennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc he was very supportive of pjm makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any rto to be effective it must have independent governance judy jonesohiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed don svandas comments from earlier in the week that one rto for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the ferc to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed ed garveyminnesotahe got the gold star for the day after very very lengthly comments from about one five commissioners he took about one minute and said fercjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward other commissioners who talked were arthurconnecticut hadleyindiana huelsmankentucky nugent maine all on the positive side other negative commentors were two guys from dc and jim irvin from arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do from the ferc commissioner standpoint the gold star went to massey after hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that ferc had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been seven years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for seven years and never could agree call me if i can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting sue six one two three three nine four

etc greetings hope everyone had a pleasant four th ive read the respective burton and hertzberg language on amending ab one x the burton language looks cleaner and simpler though there may be reasons to include some of the hertzberg language too im proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill i would appreciate your feedback the amendments would be as follows customers who were on direct access when dwr started buying power jan one seven th and are still on direct access when the bill passes should be exempt from paying for the bonds in short customers should not be forced to pay for power twiceonce from their esp and once from dwr since these customers receive power services from their esp they never consumed dwr power in the first place and it wouldnt be fair to require them to pay for it customers who have been utility customers since dwr started buying power but subsequently switched to direct access should only pay for power provided by dwr that they actually consumed no more and no less for example if a customer was a utility customer when dwr started buying power but switched to direct access on may one st then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing dwr for power deliveries that took place from jan one seven th thru april three zero th i believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past four five weeks or if we didnt explicitly agree during the talks they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now and rather than leave the issue hanging which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers i suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers obligations are your thoughts are appreciated in addition we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get california out of the energy hole that it finds itself in providing two zero kw and above customers with an incentive to switch to direct access as soon as possible could one reduce the net short position that the state and ultimately consumers have to finance thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility two reduce electricity purchasing costs and three reduce the burden on the state budget with this in mind im also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to direct access by september one st finally it seems odd that the language directing the puc to suspend direct access is still in the bill if a dedicated rate component is created that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend direct access and if thats the case would it make sense to delete that language from the bill look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the corenoncore proposal best jeff this email is intended solely for use of the
