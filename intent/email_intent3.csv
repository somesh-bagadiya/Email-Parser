summaries of todays appearance by sen john burton to the sacramento press club and of his news conference this afternoon announcing a lawsuit against ferc john burton held what amounted mostly to a qa session at a lunch with the sacramento press club today he started by talking about the edison mou which he said will be assigned to the senate utility committee for review the judiciary committee will look at the legal elements and the natural resources committee will look at issues surrounding easements one columnist commented that burton would love it to death meaning it would get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance the mou he said includes language that eliminates oversight by the puc he said that will not be the case when it leaves the senate burton is obviously troubled by the mou he said some people say it doesnt just make edison creditworthy it makes them whole he said the following would have to take place for the mou to be acceptable back debt must be verified all creditors must take a three zero haircut the transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to what the governor has mentioned four zero zero million or more must come from edisons parent to pay back debt when asked whether four zero zero million was enough he said no and that he feels the parent should pay a ton that led to a discussion of the dedicated rate component which he doesnt like he used the example that if electricity costs two zero and the dedicated rate component is five if prices drop to one zero people will unnecessarily pay higher rates a larger infusion of cash from edisons parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate component burton called the dedicated rate component a big problem and said it could be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign he said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state should set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more note this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio talk shows and other media he later threw out the number two zero zero the state is going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar he said so this is one way he sees to fight back its tough medicine but as he put it youve got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy but two days later youre over it and your stomachs ok burton also used a quote from his late brother phil on how he believe the situation should be handled the only way to deal with exploiters is to terrorize the bastards asked how long the committee process would take re the mou burton said the mou sets august one five as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress there are allowances that would let the process go as long as into december lawsuit press conference shortly after the lunch burton held a press conference to announce a lawsuit against ferc was filed today in the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit a copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this afternoon to jim steffes and should be available in his office if additional copies are needed please contact me or scott govenar the plaintiffs are burton individually and on behalf of the senate bob hertzberg individually and on behalf of the assembly and the city of oakland at the event were burton hertzberg oakland mayor jerry brown atty joe cotchett of cotchett pitre simon in burlingame atty clark kelso a constitutional scholar from mcgeorge school of law sen liz figueroa and joan breuner vice mayor of oakland the suit asks for ferc to respond within seven days and a ruling within two one days burton opened by explaining that they were suing ferc for not fulfilling its statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates hertzberg added that ferc had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit for californians relief joe cotchett said the suit is very basic and is based on the federal power act which he says limits power costs to fair and justifiable rates a primary strategy in this suit is to present it as a health and welfare and public safety suit he noted that there are three million disabled children and one two zero zero zero convalescent homes in ca who can be adversely affected by blackouts he said it is not an economic lawsuit its about senior citizens disabled kids and convalescent facilities today also happened to be the legislative day for the california association of health facilities the nursing home trade assn and several nursing home workers were apparently asked to sit at the back of the room for effect cotchett said ferc has been told for three years that there were opportunities to exert market power he also claimed that a redondo beach facility obviously aes was fined eight million by ferc for taking its plant offline and substituting higher rates he said however that this order had been sealed he cited an industry report that predicts two six zero hours of blackouts this summer which could mean four hours a day that could be he said potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration cotchett noted that only hospitals with more than one zero zero beds are exempt from blackouts which does not protect surgical centers or many health facilities jerry brown added that prices are unjust and people are suffering continued high prices could mean potential civic disruption and that there will be more actions to mobilize western mayors liz figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit burton had mentioned clark kelso who regularly appears on tv here as a legal expert and i believe was a colleague of justice anthony kennedy in his press club appearance he said kelso had appeared regularly in the media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the suit burtons lawyers sent him the brief and kelso thought enough of it to join the legal team kelso reiterated that ferc has been aware of potential market power for three years and that the commission has delayed action unreasonably it has failed to define fair and justifiable that failure he said violates the equal protection and due process clauses of the constitution kelso said this is not a partisan issue and called upon fellow republicans to support the effort joan breuner sp oaklands vice mayor said only that she believed that if the energy situation were happening in texas rather than california the president and ferc would have acted long ago during the qa session cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary because five generators supply nine zero of the electricity in ca and all five have rate renewals before ferc he also said one of the cases that is relevant is bush v gore in which the supreme court found that failure to set standards regarding elections obviously in that case violates the equal protection clause he also said six states have expressed interest in the case and have requested briefs oregon nevada arizona washington minnesota and one other he didnt name none of these states has yet committed to joining the suit,12:48:00,No

dow jones company inc new york dow jones officials in maryland and new york have urged federal energy regulators to slow down plans to merge the three existing wholesale power markets along the eastern seaboard into a single market for the entire northeast citing concerns that rushing to consolidate the markets could create instability reduce liquidity and inflate prices the new york independent system operator and the maryland public service commission have separately asked the federal energy regulatory commission to study its plan before implementing it theres no need to do this in a hasty manner said steve sullivan spokesman for the new york iso which runs that states power market and transmission system our markets are not broken ferc is pushing utilities across the country to put their highvoltage transmission systems the wholesale power markets equivalent of the interstate highway system under the control of independent regional operators the commission says the handoff is critical to the establishment of competitive power markets as utilities with positions in the market are seen as unlikely to allow competitors equal access to the grid power traders like enron corp ene support the effort while some utilities and state regulators have opposed the assertion of federal authority in an effort to jumpstart the sluggish process ferc has outlined a plan to divide up control of the countrys power grids among four regional operators one each in the northeast southeast midwest and west but while utilities still control much of the grid elsewhere in the country transmission systems in the northeast are already run by three independent wholesale market operators ferc has told those operators to merge and has indicated a preference for modeling the new market on that run by midatlantic operator pjm interconnection llc a unified northeast power market would be the worlds largest processing nine billion in energy sales a year handling one one zero zero zero zero megawatts of electricity and serving a population of five four million according to the new york iso seeking other options the maryland public service commission along with regulators from virginia and the district of columbia filed motions in august to stay fercs order saying the commission had overstepped its authority the maryland regulators will ask a federal court to block ferc if it moves forward with its plans to consolidate the three market operators new york iso iso new england inc and pjm said robert harris the commissions assistant manager of external affairs the commission last week asked us senator barbara mikulski dmd to require ferc to explore options to ease the flow of power between markets short of a forced consolidation this proposal is unnecessary reckless and risky the psc wrote the psc held public hearings on a unified northeast power market oct three and four and plans to send the comments it received to ferc next week the new york iso and iso new england said they arent opposed to a consolidated market as long as it incorporates the best practices from each of the three existing markets the new york iso along with iso new england also wants each of the three regional markets to have equal representation on the board governing the merged market new yorks market operator also questioned whether centralizing control of a northeast power market with one operator in one location would increase its vulnerability to electronic or other attacks by terrorists ferc will hold a series of workshops next week to discuss issues related to the development of independent transmission operators across the country including the need to clear bottlenecks and guard against attempts to manipulate the market as reported new ferc chairman pat wood iii said the commission will spend a day listening to the concerns of state regulators the commission has also agreed to study its contention that consolidating markets will pay off for consumers

florida el paso corp and aes corp also have proposed undersea pipeline projects although enrons calypso project has moved the furthest in the approval process judging from the states comments on enrons proposal all three projects will face difficult questions over their safety and environmental impact just before it reaches land for example the pipeline would pass through port everglades a busy center of commerce that could be full of peril for a highpressure gas pipeline the pipeline will be routed through an area that has experienced chronic disturbances such as dredging ship groundings high ship traffic entering and leaving port everglades and storm events states the memo prepared by jayne bergstrom an environmental specialist who prepared a series of questions for the company large vessels have caused significant damage to broward county reefs in recent years including a five zero six foot cargo ship a freighter driven ashore during a february one nine nine eight

safest route for a highpressure gas pipeline enron spokesman john ambler said the pipeline probably would be three zero to four zero feet below the sea floor in the port well protected even if a ship sank or ran aground directly over it just outside the port the pipeline would ascend to three feet below the floor but that would be in a rocky area thats closed to ships he said were in the process of developing a response to all of these questions he said were in an ongoing dialogue and were optimistic about being able to resolve these concerns in a way that will allow the project to move

inserting them through the holes according to the state coral reefs deserve protection for their intrinsic natural value the memo states in addition the economic tourism fishing and recreational resources of south florida depend on healthy coral reef ecosystems calypso staff and engineers have not sufficiently demonstrated to staff that the project cannot be redesigned to avoid sensitive marine resources while the company has stated that the impact would be both temporary and insignificant the memo states that the company has not explained how this could be so the state estimated that the project would have an impact on about one five acres of coral reefs and adjacent habitats given the damage the reefs already have suffered from pollution and other sources the memo questions whether any pipelines should be routed directly to southeast florida instead it says it may be better to route them to the north through areas without reefs then connect to the pipeline system on land

new option plan as such i have contacted lawyers in various international business units to work with local counsel in each of the countries in which enron has employees who will participate in the plan to ensure that the plan does not run afoul of any legal restrictions based on current information which is likely to change between now and december per melissa laing the relevant countries in the enron europe group are norway poland spain sweden and turkey in the attachment labeled asiapac at the end of jana domkes message you will find spreadsheets for all five of the enron europe companies please review with local counsel if necessary the information in the legal compliance section of each spreadsheet to confirm that the information therein is accurate please forward any changes or comments to me and jana domke jana has requested that the review be complete by june two three rd the public relations department is currently preparing the written material that will communicate the details of the plan to the participating employees when that is available i will send it to you so that you may make any modifications that are necessary to comply with local laws in each of the enron europe countries the communication documents will be available in english spanish portuguese german and greek please call me at seven one three eight five three five six nine eight

discussed with ben about the issues below and here are some thoughts this is not a complete approach but only a starting point for discussion the main task is to build a pricing system for many names this has two components one how to price a single name one one how to price a liquid single name one two how to price an illiquid single name two how to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names the approach i would take for one one is a define a small set of liquid names b apply each of the different models we have say the six models ben has mentioned below to these names c include market prices if any for these names d sit with traders get traders intuition on where each liquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in b and c e try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models f quantify these attributes if possible g try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process and see if the decisions in the last round still make sense the approach for one two may be a define a small set of illiquid names b apply each of the different models we have to these names c sit with traders get traders intuition on where each illiquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in b d try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models e check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names f define a master set of liquid names g look for relationships by analyzing crosssection of data between attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names and their attributes then this mapping can be entered into a table and the pricing can be automated for all names in theory the success will depend on the success of the roundtable sessions for the approaches for one one and one two building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task but we can get going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any new models that we may build new models can be added to the suite of existing models i do not believe there will ever be a single model that will answer all questions for all names but rather we can refine the mappings and relative choices among models over time which would mean continuing roundtable sessions with traders limited data makes calibration very hard so i would continually ask the question what do we calibrate throughout the discussions for one one and one two and this may help guide us to new models vasant benjamin parsons zero six one nine two zero zero zero zero four one one am to ect london credit trading cc vince j

oliver gaylardlonectect subject pricing credit on thousands of names all our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to provide differential pricing on thousands of credits five zero zero zero by yearend most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information making the challenge harder and the end result more important in terms of competitive pricing advantage what we need is an overall strategy for how we plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under development fmc model default probability approach using bloombergs fair market par yield curves probabilities are generated from the riskylibor then defaultbankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology fmc model credit spread approach using the fmcs then directly taking the libor credit spread at each tenor adjusting for basis and compounding differences bond model fmc approach taking the fmcs as benchmark curves the model regresses the input bonds specific to a name on the two best fitting benchmarks the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer prices are then generated using both spread and probability approaches under testing bond model spline approach taking only the bonds specific to an issuer the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zerocoupon price curve then builds a zero yield curve from this under testing market prices for certain liquid names or sectorsratings cds market prices are used then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap prices kmv using expected default frequencies edfs from the kmv model and database we will build a model to price default swaps making appropriate risk adjustments kmv is being installed now so model will be worked on next each of these models returns a price credit default and bankruptcy and the accuracy of the price depends on many factors liquidity and regulatory differences between bond and cds markets recovery assumptions risk premia capital charges etc the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid names as possible based upon these models then use these prices alongside other financial information as the backbone to a full automated pricing system our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and market prices for all issuers alongside namespecific soft data from credit reports and financial statements if the credit is liquid enough a price will be generated from their own information only otherwise the credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits with financial information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with market or trader prices and this adjustment will feed back into the weighting and mapping composition in loose terms we could think of the system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid market prices bonds equities default swaps where the weightings are calibrated using credit analysis financial ratios etc the key steps to implementing such a system will be establishing what exactly we want to predict is it a price a rating a probability or a score we will need a clean market history to calibrate to which we only really have for ratings we will then need to develop a mapping from ratingscore to price getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to calibrate the model building the mechanics of the model ie the calibration methodology neural netsfuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates but which exact methods and software packages to use determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited information into the model getting the true market price in order to feed back an error at present such a price exists for very few credits allocating resources to the development mckinsey claimed such a system would take six one zero manmonths to develop further ideas or comments are requested as we need to develop our strategy asap the model description above is fairly vague as we dont yet have the knowledge needed to fill in the specific details further help will be especially required on this if we are to continue to move at internet speed regards

distinguish truly problematic issues from those misunderstood the political and legislative processes in california as they may tend to suggest effective courses of action to promote shortterm market accommodations that are consistent with and constructive toward longterm goals for industry restructuring case studies from other jurisdictions that shed light on the probable response of californias institutions to any of the various proposed solutions currently circulating case studies of anachronistic or otherwise inefficient industry practices impeding development interconnection or operation of distributed generation or the sale or other transfer of the energy produced case studies of market power abuse or gaming in both transmission and generation proposals for innovative treatment of costeffective emerging generation andor information technologies proposals for developing greater diversity of generation technologies andor energy providers within the state otherwise appropriate technical economic or regulatory principles and practices that are being misrepresented in the academic trade or popular press or other media distinguishing informational difficulties or factual disagreements from policy conflicts or conflicts of interest and specific suggestions for speakers who are particularly effective in addressing specific key issues or establishing confidence with the target audiences attendance at this conferenceworkshop will be limited with approximately onehalf of the seats reserved for key policymakers andor their aides key agency staff and the speakers the remaining seats will be allocated among interested consumer representatives manufacturers vendors developers and other endusers and local government and community and business representatives we presently envision the conference to include one or two key speakers with four panels of three to seven persons each addressing specific topics we are also reserving facilities for friday evening to address topical seminars requested by decisionmakers andor their key staff and additional facilities for sunday morning when the information technology and distributed generation communities will be invited to provide additional followon to questions and comments offered by key policymakers on saturday some have commented that we should have started this as much as a year ago unfortunately a year ago we did not know that today we would have doubled and tripled consumer energy bills or a two five zero mwh wholesale price cap much less an intense acrosstheboard attack on electric restructuring by some parties we are especially concerned about the efforts of some distribution utilities to establish a foothold in dg the efforts of some utilities and the independent system operator to restrict distributionlevel wheeling and the aggregation it would facilitate and the latest proposal to reintegrate metering into the distribution utility after it was successfully unbundled for the benefit of competitive energy service providers likewise language in recent legislation echoing regulatory arguments for retrenchment cannot be brushed aside we understand the difficulty of organizing such an event on less than two months notice but we also appreciate the importance of the subject as we are sure you do as well we are committed to preparing an event worthy of the time and attention of both key national observers and topranked california policymakers in the executive legislative and regulatory arenas and we would welcome your active assistance if you have any questions you are welcomed to call me at four one five seven zero three three zero three six from nine three zero am to five three zero pm pacific time for those with particularly busy schedules or time zone considerations you

Forum,telecom companies mtg to discuss bandwidth trading by michael rieke zero three two three two zero zero zero dow jones energy service copyright c two zero zero zero dow jones company inc houston dow jones a group of telecommunications companies is meeting thursday to open discussions on industry standards for bandwidth trading set up by comptel a washington dc trade association that represents the competitive telecommunications industry the meeting will initiate discussion among companies that are or probably will be active in a nascent bandwidth trading market that could be worth billions or trillions of dollars a year bandwidth is the capacity to move data over telecommunications networks russell frisby jr president of comptel told dow jones newswires that the trade groups members asked it to get involved in the discussion of bandwidth trading the fact that comptel is involved in discussion on bandwidth trading shows that people are taking the idea seriously said steven kamman a telecommunications analyst with cibc world markets this year bandwidth trading will move from a theory to practice he said before that can happen the industry needs to set ground rules for trading and that will be a major topic of discussion at the meeting it comes as no surprise that enron corp ene will be at the meeting for nearly a year the company has been promoting the idea of setting up a liquid market for trading bandwidth under standard terms and conditions tom gros vice president of global bandwidth trading for enron has two items he thinks should be at the top of the meetings agenda the first is establishing an industry organization to set the standard terms and conditions for trading bandwidth as a commodity the second is setting a north american benchmark for trading the bandwidth trading organization or bto should consist of companies with actual financial risk in bandwidth trading gros said that means the group would consist mainly of major telecommunications carriers the bandwidth producers but others also have financial risk in bandwidth he said including some major wall street players and bandwidth consumers gros said some wall street players have already begun trading bandwidth but he wouldnt identify them a source with a wall street investment bank who didnt want to be identified said gross claim was a stretch banks with trading operations are consumers using telecommunications bandwidth to move stock market and commodity trading data internationally among offices he said but they arent actively trading bandwidth as they do established commodities major consumers of bandwidth would include large internet service providers or isps gros said they should also be included in the bto before bandwidth can be quickly and easily traded domestically the market needs a north american benchmark that sets technical specifications gros said in domestic crude oil trading the benchmark is west texas intermediate which must meet standards for american petroleum institute specific gravity and for sulfur content in the bandwidth market standards would be set for qualityofservice issues like errored seconds severely errored seconds and unavailable seconds gros said those standards would cover corruption of data transmitted over bandwidth as well as the availability of bandwidth enron has suggested that the benchmark cover the route between new york and los angeles which ranks among the routes with the most data traffic in north america agreeing on standards will be the toughest job to accomplish at the meeting said ken epps senior vice president for strategic marketing for williams communications group wcg which will also be represented at the meeting the technical standards for bandwidth trading cant be set so high that they limit the number of companies that will trade epps said if the standards limit liquidity the market wont develop everybody needs to walk away feeling that its a standard they can live with that they can build their business around epps said that goal can be met its just a question of how long it will take he said i dont expect it will be settled at the first meeting of the comptel group but it will be the kickoff williams plans to keep those discussion going next month at its own carrier forum to discuss bandwidth trading standards epps said about a year ago when enron first proposed trading bandwidth as a commodity williams officials were quoted as being skeptical about the idea but last month the company announced it would take a leading role in developing a market for trading bandwidth the williams carrier meeting shows that the company is now serious about bandwidth trading williams is inviting the real players the mci worldcoms wcom the qwests q the atts t epps said its about people who have the assets and how we use these to advantage the marketplace how we build a good powerful market model comptels frisby enrons gros and williamss epps wouldnt discuss which other companies were attending the meeting in washington but dow jones newswires was able to obtain a list of attendees among the invitees are companies with experience trading energy commodities dynegy inc dyn el paso energy corp epg columbia transmission communications a unit of columbia energy group cg and koch industries which has investments in energy and telecommunications a surprise on the list is mci worldcom some industry sources have said the company opposes the idea of bandwidth trading under standard terms and conditions an industry analyst who didnt want to be identified said mci worldcoms participation in the meeting is indicative of changing attitudes in the telecom carrier industry about bandwidth trading retail marketing groups within telecommunications carrier companies dont like the idea of a liquid bandwidth trading market the analyst said such a market could turn retail customers into wholesale customers for example a retail customer like an isp could go to a liquid bandwidth market and buy at wholesale prices he said also on the attendee list are telecom carriers teleglobe tgo and global crossing ltd gblx ntt america a wholly owned subsidiary of nippon telegraph and telephone corp and progress telecom a unit of the electric utility florida progress corp fpc also on the list is recent ipo universal access inc uaxs a company that matches carriers that have excess capacity with carriers that need extra capacity lightrade a startup company setting up pooling points to allow bandwidth trading was also invited commodity traders are represented by sakura dellscher amerex prebon yamane aig telecom and the new york mercantile exchange two consulting companies andersen consulting and pricewaterhousecoopers were also invited,10:20:00,"Yes

seven eight xx based on numerous discussions with members and staff in sacramento the be st speculation on the status of the sce bailout legislation is as follows the senate is reviewing the amended sb seven eight xx approved by the assembly las t thursday they will not approve it as is instead they will hijack one of a number of assembly bills on energy currently before the senate fo r concurrence hijacking means gutting a bill and substituting in langu age on related but different matters hence they would in this instance keep the energy theme but change the bill in question to an sce bailout bi ll one that largely resembles the polancosher bill approved by the senat e in july the hijacked bill will deal with the bailout itself dcr for n ongenerator creditors etc and the conservation easements but will str ip out other elements that differ from the polancosher bill like direct a ccess renewables lowering the rate payer base to two zero kwh etc the direc t access and renewables elements might or might not be added on to some ot her energy bills currently before the senate the rate payer threshold wi ll be included in the hijacked bill and will likely be increased from two zero k wh to one two five kwh note that the latter would be a reduction from the original five zero zero kwh level in the polancosher bill two zero the senate will send the hijacked bill back to the assembly probably on w ednesday the assembly will have the choice of taking it or leaving it or calling for a conference committee to work it out before session ends mid night on friday the latter is the likely alternative setting up round t he clock all nighters for the conferees through friday if the conference committee reaches consensus the resulting bill will have to be approved by both houses before sending it to the governor if the conferees think theres a deal there but they need more time they can ask the governor to extend the session into next week that scenario seems unlikely the me mbers want to either pass or reject the bill this week and get out of do dge two zero if there is no hope of consensus this week the bill will likely die at th at point and the bailout will be history the governor can try to prolong things to give him more time to persuade members to pass the bill by eith er extending the session into next week or by adjourning the session and c alling for a third extraordinary session next week or at some later date the senate and assembly would be compelled to go into session but just a s with a normal session individual members would not be compelled to atte nd if there were either one not enough members present for a quorum or two not enough yes votes present even if there is a quorum the bill dies two zero i emphasize again that

many states that allow for independent review of treatment decisions made by health maintenance organizations additional appeals culled from the thousands of cases that crossed the justices desks this

prompted several significant supreme court interpretations in the last couple of years in toyota vs williams zero zero one zero eight nine the justices will decide whether workers who cant perform some of their duties because of a limited impairment are disabled under the statute business groups like the national association of manufacturers worry that a lower court ruling in the case will force employers to accommodate workers who arent really disabled the case involves former toyota motor corp tm employee ella williams who was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis while working as an engine builder at the companys georgetown ky plant in the early one nine nine zero s she claims her ailment amounts to a disability and says the company should accommodate her by giving her different duties a federal appeals court in cincinnati deeming williams disabled under the statute said her lawsuit could proceed in a second ada case the justices will use an appeal from us airways group inc u to clarify whether companies are required to accommodate disabled workers by moving them into jobs reserved for more senior employees the arlington va carrier says moving customer

thats left the patent bar completely in disarray says seth p waxman a former solicitor general in the clinton administration at issue in that case festo vs shoketsu kinzoku zero zero one five four three is a principle of the us patent system known as the doctrine of equivalents which says imitators cannot avoid patent infringement by simply making minor changes to a patented invention the us court of appeals for the federal circuit settled the dispute by crafting new rules that make it tougher in many cases for inventors to invoke the doctrines protections festo corp a unit of germanys festo ag alleges that japans smc corp copied with minor modifications its patented design for magnetic rodless cylinders festo filed its suit in one nine eight eight and won a series of judgments until last year when the federal circuit ruled eight four that smc hadnt infringed festos patents its not too much say that the decision has dealt the patent system a crippling blow says robert h bork a former federal judge who is representing festo in jem ag supply vs pioneer nine nine one nine nine six the justices will decide whether seeds and plants grown from seeds can be patented the us patent and trademark office has issued utility patents on crops grown from seeds since one nine eight five and their validity was largely untested before one nine nine eight when dupont cos dd pioneer hibred international inc unit sued a belmond iowa farmsupply company for selling pioneerbrand seed corn without its permission the supplier farm advantage inc argues that congress never intended utility patents to be awarded for plant varieties companies like dupont have spent big money to modify seeds genetically and want to shield new varieties from copycats the federal circuit agreed with pioneer the justices will hear arguments oct three deregulation battles several appeals will force the high court to resolve some key disputes over efforts by federal regulators to open the nations local telephone markets to competition the federal communications commission longdistance carriers and local phone companies all found reason to disagree with a ruling last year from a federal appeals court in st louis the nations high court has already waded into the murky waters of telecommunications deregulation ruling that congress in one nine nine six gave the fcc the authority to formulate the prices local carriers charge wouldbe rivals for access to their networks the appeals now before the justices arose from the same litigation but this time focus on the fcc rules themselves rather than the agencys statutory authority this courts intervention is needed again the government says this time the stakes are if anything even higher the lead case is verizon vs fcc zero zero five one one arguments are set for oct one zero the justices will also decide whether the fcc can set rates some cable television systems and wireless phone companies pay to string wires or hang antennas on electric poles a federal appeals court in atlanta nixed some of the fccs ratesetting powers power companies say the fcc overstepped its authority when it set pole attachment rates for cable companies that provide high speed internet access over their lines they also say congress never intended for the agency to regulate rates charged to wireless providers who want to use their poles the cases national cable television association vs gulf power zero zero eight three two and fcc vs gulf power zero zero eight four three will be argued oct two the justices will turn their attention the following day to the two one five billion electricity industry when it hears challenges to landmark federal rules requiring utilities to open their highvoltage power lines to competitors several state regulators say the federal energy regulatory commission overreached when it issued order eight eight eight in one nine nine six under the rules utilities must provide access to their transmission lines to anyone buying or selling electricity in the interstate market the rules were backed by a federal appeals court here last year the high court will also consider a separate appeal from enron

skilling left enron in paragraph seven rewrites paragraphs six two zero by jamie lareau new york sept two four reuters when thomas neff took over executive recruitment firm spencer stuart little did he know he would soon be widowed and a single parent while running a rapidly growing worldwide company neff now chairman of spencer stuart was an effective ceo from one nine seven nine to one nine eight seven though a personal tragedy and his companys rapid expansion made his job especially stressful my wife died in one nine eight five and i had three young boys neff told reuters it was stressful in that we quadrupled our revenues and doubled the number of offices in the world so the travel load increased so that just adds to stress company boards are taking a long look at how executives cope with stress and not just the anxiety of running a fortune five zero zero company as unforeseen events such as the loss of human life after the attacks on the world trade center can have enormous repercussions on a company companies are looking for people like neff who can handle a hectic schedule and enormous responsibility with grace and success and will not unexpectedly leave the company on aug one four ceo jeff skilling of energy company enron corp resigned after only six months on the job leading shares to plunge on his shock departure skilling had enduring months of weakness in enrons stock price and several highprofile stumbles which left questions if his departure had less to do with personal reasons as he stated and more to do with unyielding stress skilling declined several requests for an interview though he told the wall street journal in august pressure he felt from a plummeting stock price and the deaths of three workers in an english power plant accident reminded him how tenuous life is spotting signs of stress neff now helps spencer stuart and other companies decide who would make a good chief executive and who is just not cut out for the task he calls it one of the most important decisions the board makes and therefore the board should lead the process of succession and not the outgoing chief executive the board must also learn to watch for signs of anxiety such as when skilling called a fund manager an asshole during an analyst conference call in april said dr paul baard associate professor of communications and management at fordham universitys graduate school of business he said the incident was a clear indication skilling was cracking under the pressure if your life is tied up in your position and youre hypervigilant in your environment and you get a short seller who says this guy isnt capable of taking the companys stock price higher thats a major threat baard said many industry experts said boards should offer overstressed corporate officers an executive coach for some counseling when they see signs of stress and they should keep in mind that the smartest person in the company might not make the best boss most of the challenge of business to me is the people side said mark nevins vice president of human resources and professional development as executive search firm kornferry international at the end of the day running a business is partly about understanding cash flow inventory costs balance sheets those are tough to learn but you can do it people however have their own motivations theyre perverse and they dont want to be managed part of the challenge is to deal with that and motivate them nevins said a board should look outside the company when conducting a search for chief executive so that theres a benchmark of candidate comparison the interview process boards should also seek the guidance of either psychologists or executive consultants on how to effectively interview candidates said baard who has written about workplace issues on leadership for several academic journals the board needs to ask the right questions and to know what the answers really tell about a persons work ethic and personality he said as chairman of spencer stuart and a board member for other companies neff has been a part of developing a careful selection process to find the right ceo including a close look at how candidates handled tough times at other companies neff suggested asking these questions do you have the stomach to make tough decisions that need to be made and might involve people youve known for years such as job cuts how does your family feel about you being a ceo and the added pressures and travel that the job would present its amazing at how often those questions are not being asked neff said asking a candidate to tell the board about himself or herself and knowing what the answers reveal is important baard said for example if the person talks only about their career accomplishments and no other dimension of their life there might be some concern that the person is not balanced baard said he said asking questions about how the executive has handled past conflict will show if they take responsibility and own their errors or if they are an avoider of conflict a good question is what does becoming a chief executive mean to you if the answer involves a lot of selffocus with little emphasis on team work and a desire to help others than that person might not make a good chief executive baard said another important question is to ask which constituency would give the candidate the most trouble this makes the candidate consider who they are reporting to and can reveal if that person would be upfront with or hide from certain people he said ask what did you really screw up baard said that question will shock them but youre looking for ownership youre waiting for the but and if you dont hear it thats good copyright two zero zero zero

europe to trade the contracts this is a way for firms to hedge their risk of bad weather and its effects on net sales jyrki kivineimi derivatives advisor at the helsinki bourse told reuters weather derivatives contracts which originated in the united states allow companies to hedge against the financial impact on their operations of changes in the weather he said the bourse planned to offer the market derivatives contracts based on an average temperature index and with a duration of one month kivineimi declined to give a precise date for the launch of weather derivatives londons liffe derivatives exchange launched three european weather indices in july and also has plans to start weather derivatives trading possibly in the fourth quarter this year kivineimi said groups whose sales could be affected by changes in weather such as travel companies transport consumer goods and energy firms had shown particular interest in the offer many companies are interested in these products and there has already been a lot of trading in the overthecounter otc market kivineimi said but the most potential customers are energy firms energy companies use weather derivatives to protect themselves against the impact of temperature fluctuations in electricity and gas prices otc weather derivatives trading has expanded over the last year with deals reported in france and germany the liberalisation of europes energy markets over the last couple of years has sparked interest in weather derivatives as consumers face increasinly volatile gas and electricity prices using the example of an electricity firm selling heating kivineimi said the firm could sign a derivatives contract specifying expected sales at a expected average temperature for a given month if heating sales are lower than expected because of the weather being warmer than expected the firm will be compensated for its loss that month he said but he acknowledged the difficulty of entering contracts that are based on predicting weather conditions several months ahead when meteorologists often fail to accurately predict weather from one day to the next a weather derivative is more an insurance against bad

boyhood divided a boys life in and out of the family script by melinda henneberger the last thing al gores father told him a few days before he died and just before he lost the ability to speak was son always do right always do right his father the senator felt he had himself done right a lot of the time and reliably kept after his son to follow suit after the vice president talked about that last conversation though in a eulogy he had worked on without sleeping for two nights straight even some friends wondered whether his father had tacked on a hollywood ending scripting his goodbyes at least in part for the benefit of the papers and maybe the history books this time nobody came right out and accused mr gore himself of tweaking the dialogue even the rawest and most intimate moments in his life are now widely seen as mere theatrics all part of a presidential campaign strategy designed by his ambitious upfromnothing parents albert and pauline lafon gore before he was born and even unto death that perception has clearly become a political problem for the vice president gov george w bush of texas regularly suggests that mr gore is a naturalborn phony and the vice presidents every remark is now factchecked so scrupulously that when he recently said he had once dreamed of becoming a teacher reporters wondered if he could prove it had anyone ever heard that story before the questions are about more than mr gores assertions about the internet and love story what in his life was scripted and what was real could even he know the difference where did his parents hopes end and his own begin and do you only get credit for hosing out hog parlors if you did it without an agenda but in separating the facts from the fanciful in mr gores life perhaps the most striking discovery is the extent to which the material that is the most widely doubted is also the most demonstrably true al gore did do a lot of his growing up in tennessee he did work hard on the farm there so hard in fact that the hired help felt sorry for him and thought his father should ease up in the same way some of what is generally assumed about mr gores life is not true he did not for example live in luxury back in washington during the school year mr gores parents were both famously frugal and were not well off until after their son had grown and after the senators political career had ended though they sent their children to exclusive schools and provided such social necessities as ballroom dancing lessons for their son they also dressed him in a cousins handmedowns and lived in a hotel because it was owned by a relative who gave them a break on the rent some summers the gores had to pack up their fourroom suite and put their belongings in storage so the place could be sublet while they were in tennessee and al shared a bedroom with his sister nancy who was one zero years older both before and after her college years part of the reason that the contours of mr gores unusual upbringing are not better known however is that he himself has worked so hard to discredit a lot of authentic stories about his childhood the very stories in fact that would probably do him the most good politically the problem for him is the scenes from the past that portray mr gore sympathetically at the expense of his harddriving parents they suggest an emotionally neglected boy forced to bear the weight of enormous adult expectations and mr gore who is fiercely protective of his eight seven yearold mother and the memory of his father categorically balks at that for a time a decade ago after his unsuccessful one nine eight eight presidential campaign and his sons nearfatal car accident the next year mr gore himself seemed determined to explore the meaning of his own life story he made a serious study of family dysfunction the subtext of his one nine nine two environmental manifesto earth in the balance and passed out copies of alice millers drama of the gifted child a book about how narcissistic parents can leave their highachieving children cut off from their own feelings and hazy on just what they want other than to make mom and dad proud back then friends said he was absorbed by the need to figure things out to emerge from his fathers shadow to decide but today mr gore seems nothing if not decided he does want to be president and if he can never really know exactly how much of that want began with his parents his current attitude seems to be so what one of the oldest plots in the human story is child follows parent he said recently with what sure seemed like authentic boredom and looking back on his early years did not seem so very difficult in a series of interviews about his life he was relaxed and appeared at peace with the past he frankly described a childhood in which even the usual juvenile scrapes might become part of continuing political calculations maybe the same way writers often end up milking their families for material when he got in trouble for throwing whitewash on trucks as they passed the gore farm when he was one two for example his father made him send letters of apology to a number of trucking companies that was also an election year i believe he remarked wryly but he made clear it was also just a kids life from the farm and the city i was conceived in tennessee mr gore began drawling for effect in a radio announcer voice that poked fun at the whole biographical exercise though his political opponents have successfully portrayed him as a purebred washington creature with only photoop moments in the heartland he did have a life there on the family farm and by all accounts a more intense emotional connection to that place than to the nations capital his real childhood was in tennessee in washington he spent his time with adults important adults in whose presence he was expected to behave beautifully and did tennessee was at the very least where al gore wished he had grown up his buddies in tennessee certainly considered carthage the small community on the cumberland and the caney fork rivers where the gores spent summers and holidays as his true home there were not a lot of kids around the fairfax the embassy row hotel where the gores lived while in washington so he could not wait to get back home said steve armistead al gores closest childhood friend and a good pal still i went up there when mr gore was in high school and the friend he had in the fairfax was a bellhop mr armistead said there were all these dignitaries but not much for a kid there was a dullness a loneliness about it he didnt lay around washington much when he could have been in carthage and thats where he got his values working on the farm and growing up around smith county people of course mr gore is the product of both washington and tennessee and of the very fact of having grown up in two places with two groups of friends and two ways of looking at the world he was born in washington lived in tennessee from the time he was one until he was four while his father ran for the senate and then moved between the two places until college this back and forth set him slightly apart from those around him in season and out and made him tough to figure even his sense of humor is a hybrid a little bit corny with flashes of sarcasm mr gore himself seems to feel that his splitscreen view of the world was a gift at least in the end even though i spent more time each year in washington tennessee was home he said now im sure that part of that was me as a kid absorbing my parents insistence on the political reality of their lives that they were representing tennessee in washington im sure i picked up a lot of that as a child but it was more than that he described tennessee as a place where the human relationships were much warmer and where he had his dearest friends i think i learned a great deal from the forgive the word the parallactic view provided by growing up in two places he says now because just as having two eyes gives you depth perception having two homes allows you to see some things that stand out in relief when viewed from two different perspectives a tennessee work ethic mr gores father who also favored fancy words moved between two worlds too and for all his striving in washington did not believe in leaving either tennessee or his farm roots behind ever even after his career in politics ended and he and his wife thought that working on the farm would be good for their son whom they told friends they hoped would be president one day it was expected from the time he was little said james fleming a nashville doctor and friend of nancy gores who for a time served as the gore family physician it was not so much that the gores thought cleaning out barns would add just the right touch of log cabin to his rsum family friends said as that they simply felt it would toughen him up and give him a proper work ethic his daddy used to get him up about six oclock in the morning said mattie lucie payne who worked for the gores as a housekeeper for more than four zero years and al would say daddy we have men working and his daddy would say i know and you go on down and help them he baled hay cut tobacco and cleaned out hog parlors along with the hired help but the senator also seemed to revel in assigning his son some of the most backbreaking tasks like clearing two zero hilly acres with a hand ax hed drive him pretty hard said gordon thompson a friend whose family used to live on the gore farm back when his own father worked for the senator but then he drove himself hard too even at four h camp as a nine yearold he asked to be given the heavylifting kitchen duty usually reserved for one three and one four yearolds he was the only camper i ever had volunteer for kp said jerry cole the local four h agent for several weeks every summer after school let out but before his parents could get away from washington mr thompson said al would stay with them in a house with no indoor plumbing he never complained mr thompson said i think he was always happiest on the farm always he was serious he pretty much acted the same way when he was one three as he does now said donna armistead steve armisteads sister and mr gores first real girlfriend for several years beginning when he was an extremely confident one three yearold and she was one six he was a terrific listener recalled ms armistead now a nurse and divorced mother of two and not just to her she said he would pay attention to the old folks at her grandparents grocery store and hold his grandmothers hand in the nursing home for long stretches several times a week mr gores own mother was not very touchy ms armistead said adding when he came in she just wouldnt come running to hug him she said his father used an entirely different voice when he talked with al hed talk with authority she said and nobody the way ms armistead remembers it gave him any breaks for being a senators son once after mr gore and ms armistead had done a particularly hard job on the farm the senator told him to take her out for a meal at a certain cafe we were so thrilled she remembered but after dinner al gets up to the cash register and said my dad said to charge it to him and the guy wouldnt do it the senators tab was too long already so i had to tell him id be right back and go get the money from my mom ms armistead said a touch of mischief still his time in tennessee was not all boot camp and character building and mr gore did manage to have some unscripted fun mr thompson remembers his friend as pranky with a love of practical jokes that endures today one new years eve several of his friends said their whole group was snowed in at the gore farm so pauline gore corralled all the girls in an upstairs bedroom and the boys in als room on the lower level the senator dressed in his bathrobe sat sentry duty at the top of the stairs all night long and every so often yelled downstairs to his son and the other boys who were busy sharing one bottle of beer at first light ms armistead heard a knock on the window looked out and saw al and his buddies who had slipped out a window and climbed up onto the deck outside her room where they were making snowmen in their underwear for the girls benefit mr albert still thought he had everything under control she said her brother steve describes a pretty mild teenage rebellion we did all the experimental things kids do wed sneak out at night and pick up coke bottles off a front porch that probably were not ours or go to the lake and maybe do a little water skiing at night that was not too smart and occasionally have a party we probably did a little bit of alcohol abuse but there were also times even as a kid when mr gore flouted authority more directly once while staying with the thompsons he heard that his father who was away was going to be giving a speech in nashville five five miles east his parents though had decided that their son should not come to the event he was little one two at most mr thompson said but al went over to carthage and caught the bus and went down there still dressed for the farm that didnt go over too well his mom called and wanted to know where he was that was a biggie my mom had to tell her he wasnt here today youd be worried about all kinds of things happening but they were more concerned about him not being all cleaned up like a lot of mothers pauline gore always insisted publicly that her son was at all times the perfect boy but was she embellishing a little at least at times she apparently thought she had reason to worry dr fleming said i remember donna this goodlooking girl running around the house and pauline saying ohmigod shes going to get pregnant i know it mr gore was not shy about expressing affection for his girlfriend in front of his mother i remember pauline and i drove him to the airport one time said ms armistead and he kissed her on the cheek and then he kissed me i mean he laid one on me honey ms armistead says the two of them were lectured miss pauline said keep busy dont think about sex enjoy your time together but always have something in mind to do she said cold showers and lots of exercise but she also says mrs gore need not have worried sex was sex even then ms armistead said but al and i both had goals finding a role model today the vice president seems to enjoy looking back on the benign pleasures of the summers when he got to be a kid in tennessee skinnydipping with mr thompson in a cattle trough or hypnotizing chickens which mr gore says is a littleknown farm skill passed down from adolescent wizard to adolescent wizard mr gore also situates himself politically in tennessee as heir not only to his father but to cordell hull whom he describes as the model for public service in our part of the country mr hull floated logs down the cumberland river with mr gores grandfather settled in carthage and became the congressman in the seat the gore father and son later held an ardent freetrader mr hull won the nobel peace prize for his role in founding gatt now the world trade organization and was secretary of state in world war ii but before that he was a judge on the circuit and in one zero counties there the picture above the judges chair in the courtroom is neither george washington thomas jefferson nor franklin roosevelt mr gore said with the greatest possible reverence its cordell hull to this day asked to name the most important things he had inherited from his parents mr gore talked for a long time about his father and his fathers ideals but the first thing he said in answer to the question was this some of what people perceive as the stiffness and formality i sometimes lapse into comes in part from my fathers habit of trying to ensure that he always presented a dignified appearance to live up to the position he felt deserved dignity people who saw him on the stump and playing the fiddle find that ironic because they dont remember the formal bearing that he had in most of his appearances he had a capacity to enjoy humor and music and friendship and he also felt the need to present himself as a senator in a formal and dignified way those who knew the senator say his climb from poverty was still too fresh and stereotypes of tennessee hillbillies with dirt under their fingernails still too prevalent for him to feel he could afford the luxury of letting his guard down in certain public settings his father always raised cattle he always farmed he always found relaxation even in washington by going to the farm and working with cattle the vice president said but he became a statesman too mr gore said ive often thought in my fathers persona he continued to manifest both his friends feel sure mr gore would move back to carthage if as mr thompson delicately put it worse comes to worst the vice president laughed at that but agreed well ill retire in carthage for sure he said you know i hope thats many years from now one thing that still strikes all his tennessee friends as odd though is that through all the time he spent there growing up he never spoke a word about washington and he absolutely refused to wear any of the neatly folded tshirts his mother had packed for him tshirts emblazoned with the name of his prep school st albans he probably thought we would think he was trying to act like he was better than the rest of us guessed his old friend edward blair but mr gore who had his boots up on the table in front of him as he talked snorted when he heard this i guess maybe they were thinking that washington is such a neat place he said that i would naturally want to tell them all about the great things there few comforts of home if the fairfax was a cold place to grow up it was not because there was no family close by the owner grady gore was a cousin of the senators louise gore one of gradys daughters lived in the hotel her sister mary gore dean moved in too after her husband died in a plane crash for a while their brother jimmy gore and his family were on the premises as well when they moved it was just down the block but the vice president is not sentimental about his time there i came to love the farm he said the hotel i never loved the senators correspondence makes clear that he and his family were there because the price was right the gores looked for a house in washington for years but never found anything they felt they could afford and one thing that seems to bother mr gore far more in fact than the idea that his five two years add up to something that is not so much a life as a story line is the perception that i was in this luxury apartment eating room service sort of like eloise asked if his younger days in washington were lonely he sighed oh no he said i mean i had good friends and i had my sister and its not as if i didnt have my parents they went out frequently and every six years they had a hard campaign but they were great and loving parents and the times when they were pulled away i had nancy and my friends i wasnt left alone with my thoughts he got pretty creative about making his own fun sometimes upending all the furniture in the living room to construct an elaborate fort but activity was supposed to be purposeful his dad was a very very proud man and believed that old cordell hull thing of youre put on earth for a purpose and its to improve the condition of life said mr gores cousin mark gore who lived down the block his cousin also remembers senator gore teaching him to swim by throwing him into a pool when he was four while al who was seven looked on laughing from fourth grade on young al attended st albans the episcopal boys prep school on the grounds of the national cathedral where he did well but was not according to friends especially happy throughout high school he wrote his tennessee girlfriend ms armistead twice a day and called her on a pay phone every saturday night two of mr gores closest washington friends recall that while al gore was the focus of his parents fondest hopes it was his freespirited rebellious sister nancy who took more of their energy the general topic of conversation over there was what outrageous thing nancy did this week said one of these friends she got a lot of attention and al was kind of an afterthought because he never misbehaved for him the best times were those spent throwing a ball around with his father at grady gores estate in potomac md he had some cattle from the tennessee farm brought up there mr gore said smirking like he knows that sounds kind of crazy and a lot of times on weekends wed go up there and hed work with the cattle and id help him and then wed take a break sometimes too they played catch in the russell building outside the senators office though if someone walked by hed duck back into the office until they passed because it wasnt very dignified the son recalled when al gore had real ballgames though it was his sister not his father who would come more often his father took him to senate hearings he sat through long stretches of discussion over the bill cosponsored by his father that created the interstate system of highways how wide would the new roads be green or blue for the road signs as a kid mr gore followed these developments avidly keeping track of the miles of completed highway the way other kids his age followed the yankees box scores he also took me on the senate floor even though he wasnt supposed to mr gore remembered and one day when al was five he was invited to come up front to meet the vice president richard m nixon who was presiding that day he put me on his knee and was very nice to me and the experience forever after deprived me of the more sublime pleasures of nixon hatred once mr gores father let his son listen in on an extension while he spoke to president john f kennedy who at the time was furious at a certain steel executive for raising prices after the steel workers had agreed not to seek a wage increase the family anecdote that my father always told after that like a lot of family anecdotes i cant really vouch for but he said that i said dad i didnt know presidents talked that way the vice president does have strong memories of kennedy though i was blown away by his inaugural address he said i remember so vividly the thick snow on the seats and listening to each word bring out such poetic force really it was a remarkable time my sister was one of the first volunteers for the peace corps that month and the whole family was filled with the excitement of the new frontier they all wanted each in their own way to be part of that excitement and the entire family talked a lot about not just the bills before congress but the big issues of the day especially civil rights in these discussions was his mother more liberal than his father as some who knew the couple have suggested mmmmm my dad was pretty liberal mr gore answered she was like most moms the conscience of the family but they didnt really disagree and my sister was more liberal than both of them put together then mr gore started to laugh and kept on for a good long time it was a family of many consciences he said,10:36:00,No

kevin m davis mark dana may tom will llo yd lindberg susan gupta gautam misra narsimha scheuer janelle baug hman edward d herndon rogers cc nicolay christi l subject re rto week summary of congestion management panel rto week day two october one six two zero zero one congestion management and transmission rights the morning panel discussion was on congestion management the panelists w ere nancy brockway commissioner new hampshire psc reem fahey edison mi ssion carol guthrie chevrontexaco shmuel oren university of california berkley and advises texas puc andy ott pjm michael schnitzer northbr idge group general observations the commissioners were again all present wood left midmorning to give tes timony on capitol hill today however ferc staff was much more active i n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions the topic s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be ing rehashed again this will probably continue for the rest of the week what i have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts most notably the need for a real time energ y market based using lmp very few panelists have opposed this at most a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st andardized basically conceding that pjms system will be implemented in the northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else two zero locational marginal pricing the panelists all agreed that lmp in the real time market is necessary sch muel oren does not oppose it most of the panelists think this needs to b e standardized across rtos andy ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized car ol guthrie does not favor standardization and urged ferc to not standardize the pjm system throughout the eastern interconnect she said ferc should try a couple of different systems and see what works two zero ftrs versus flowgates the panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial not phys ical schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h is preference unclear most of the panelists including the psc commissi oner prefer ftrs rather than flowgates schmuel is a flowgate advocate after some discussion the panelists agreed that ftrs and flowgates could w ork together provided that the definition of flowgate is understood andy ott said flowgates could work with ftrs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs liquidity standard product and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of pointtopoint rights then ftrs and flowgates can coexist if a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights it s okay however if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s cheduling the two cannot coexist schmuel seemed to agree with this premi se although this is not his preference he seems to prefer only flowgates without ftrs brockway seems to prefer ftrs rather than flowgates for fe ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs the panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from ftrs or fl owgates should be allocated to load but the method of allocation was not a greed upon ferc staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate s many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu tes a commercially significant flowgate and what happens when circumstance s change over time resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig nificant schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates but if pa rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg ed use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable two zero the panelists agreed that these financial rights either ftrs or flowgates should be tradable in the secondary market the panelists disagreed on wh ich instrument ftrs or flowgates are more tradable andy thinks ftrs are more tradable schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable options versus obligations the panelists discussed the benefits of having ftrs be options but also dis cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if ftrs are only options and the ftr holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow andy ott said options will most likely result in fewer ftrs bein g allocated schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front two zero the afternoon panel was on transmission planning and expansion steve walt on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly two zero let me know if you have any questions sarah,06:37:19,No

these companies or the value of its holdings in them couldnt be immediately determined but the existence of these partnerships could feed investors fears that enron has billions of dollars of

agencies moodys fitch and sp recently put enrons credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an ljm deal that led to the one two billion hit to equity enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade but its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade or junk bonds suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely if enrons rating drops below investment grade it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least three four billion in offbalance sheet obligations in addition many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade friday the company drew down three billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations raising cash in the cp market could be tough when investors are jittery about enrons condition this week a number of energy market players reduced exposure to enron however in a friday press release ceo lay said that enron was the marketmaker of

enron as one longtime enron bull and shareholder said i never had to worry about enrons ability to survive until this week i still find it hard to believe peter eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling enrons adventures for some time if youd listened to him earlier this year youd have profited from his knowledge his reporting on enrons partnership shenanigans to the departure of chief financial officer andrew fastow has been outstanding the rumors from a pending bankruptcy to a justice department investigation are for now just that and enron did not singlehandedly cause the california power crisis nor is royal dutchshell rdnyse news commentary about to make a bid to buy the company sources do tell me that headcount reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business and while former ceo jeff skilling shares culpability for the current mess his departure appears only indirectly related to enrons current woes now enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and more importantly its reputation the companys challenge but what does enron do now its very simple come clean clean up the mess and refocus on its core business wholesale energy markets risk management and retail energy services they support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks our gut feel is that enron can pull it off and longterm investors should hold firm as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings with upside potential to two five per share over the next one two one eight months says jeff dietert power analyst at simmons co and a member of the tsc energy roundtable we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery dietert outlines four challenges for enron one management must regain the streets confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balancesheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow two enron must maintain its investmentgrade credit rating three enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans four enron must control the timing of the recognition of the writedown in the value of any assets where market value is less than book straightforward yes easy to accomplish no although enron says additional writedowns are unlikely except a two zero zero million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change analysts arent so sure theyre focused on the companys global assets portfolio sporting six billion in book value but generating an ebit earnings before interest and taxes loss of one eight million over the past one two months the divestitures include three nine zero million in exploration and production assets in india two five zero million in a puerto rico power plant and two five zero million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general which is set to close in two zero zero two there will likely be others however enron has to execute here and given the current state of its affairs the seller will feel the pressure the creditrating issue is a fine line the current ratings bbb from standard poors and baaone from moodys are three levels above noninvestment grade however both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades dietert estimates that enrons debttomarket cap will be about four eight by yearend and the company has interest coverage ebitda interest expense of about three five times by comparison the average sp bbbrated company has a debttocap of four seven four and interest coverage of about six one times the average bb company has debttocap of six one three and interest expense of three eight times frankly everything falls on enrons management team and its ability to reassure investors if enrons management does not step up to calm investor fears these fears could become a selffulfilling prophecy dietert says in the potentially vicious cycle investor fears could drive stocks down the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades potentially lower credit ratings force counterparties to reduce exposure to enron limiting enrons ability to generate earnings and cash flow its time for enron to grow up despite a lot of

downplay report of default two zero zero one one zero two six one seven one four new york by kristen mcnamara of dow jones newswires new york dow jonesenron corps ene retail sales unit defaulted on its credit requirement in new englands wholesale power market this month but the event was neither unique nor newsworthy the energy company and the organization that developed the markets rules said friday the operator of the regions wholesale power market informed enron energy services last week that for the third time in one two months it had traded a greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at risk for expulsion from new englands market but it was administrative mixups rather than financial problems that triggered the warning which a few other companies have also received in the past the markets rulemaker said i can state with considerable confidence that there have been other participants that have defaulted on their credit agreements and its never been in the news said david doot secretary and general counsel for the new england power pool which developed the policies governing the regions electricity market my instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of proportion news of the enron units default appeared in a trade publication and a major metropolitan newspaper this week as enrons dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the companys stock and bond prices enron energy services never received word that it had defaulted on its bonding requirement twice before because both times it corrected the problem within a day spokeswoman peggy mahoney said the letter sent by iso new england which operates the regions power market to notify the enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong person delaying the companys response mahoney said clearly it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit mahoney said the company resolved the problem by oct one nine mahoney said iso new england spokeswoman ellen foley confirmed friday that the company had cured its default its rare for a company to default three times but it has happened on occasion foley and doot said i wont say its commonplace but i wont say its unusual for a participant to find itself out of compliance doot said

bloomberg enron corp facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into partnerships run by the former chief financial officer remains a target of investigations and lawsuits in california california lawmakers and regulators have accused power providers of manipulating the states energy market to raise prices enron the biggest energy trader and other power sellers have denied the charges repeatedly next month a california senate committee investigating the power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if enron and other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading documents enron has been filing documents in sacramento california they are still putting documents in their depository and i dont think theyve completed that process said alexandra montgomery a consultant to the committee it remains to be seen whether enron is complying with its subpoena she said the suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in california soared leaving the states two largest utilities insolvent under californias plan to open its electricity market to competition the utilities of pge corp and edison international werent allowed to pass rising costs to customers i know that were doing our best to comply with what the committee is asking for enron spokesman mark palmer we are putting documents in the depository and were looking forward to a speedy

commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost enron three five million grand jury enron also is one of the companies being investigated for civil and criminal violations by california attorney general bill lockyer who convened a grand jury in june lockyer has been criticized by enron officials for telling the wall street journal in may that he would like to put enron chairman kenneth lay in an eight x one zero cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says hi my name is spike honey lockyer later apologized for the remark the attorney generals investigation is proceeding lockyer spokeswoman sandra michioku said michioku said she didnt know when civil or criminal charges against enron or other power providers might be filed our investigation is still being pursued she said we had to go to court to get enron to turn over documents so that slowed things down a bit enrons palmer said he didnt know the status of the attorney generals investigation i think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman palmer said more lawsuits enron along with other major power providers such as duke energy corp and dynegy inc face at least five lawsuits alleging they manipulated california energy prices in violation of antitrust laws the cases which include separate complaints filed by the city of san francisco california lieutenant governor cruz bustamante and various consumers currently are in state courts awaiting a coordination proceeding said michael aguirre a lawyer representing bustamante the lawsuits should be assigned to a judge by the end of next month he said if the complaints succeed the companies might be ordered to

billion in thirdquarter losses from failed investments enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions enrons decision to tap its credit line was a smart financial move said stephen moore a vice president at moodys investors service who follows the company it took away the hassle and timeconsuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital though enrons bonds have investmentgrade ratings their yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds that carry junk ratings according to bloomberg data companies with bb ratings pay on average nine one six percent to borrow for seven years a lower credit rating may also force enron to buy back holdings in other partnerships with its

less time for the partnerships to find the best price for the power plants and other assets enron would have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell for and the amount of the debt

check out the economics in the last paragrph lb ammonia industry finally approaches full production plummeting gas prices have prompted a large number of idled ammonia producers to restart operations this month after lengthy downtime due to last winters record gas price increases houstonbased industrialinfocom which tracks manufacturing said most of the gulf coast and midcontinent plants are at partial or full capacity an ammonia industry expert at duke energy said there has been a two zero increase in ammonia production two two two zero zero zero tons of ammonia since august representing about seven six bcf of gas demand three four mmbtu per ton of ammonia there was a doubling of ammonia productive capacity in louisiana alone we think just about every plant in the us is back on or in the process of coming back up right now he said obviously they are not going to be running full out but every plant is coming back up a year ago ammonia producers were rocked by soaring natural gas prices which reached one zero mmbtu up from a historical average of two combined with product overcapacity the rising costs caused a wave of plant shutdowns across the country louisiana was particularly hard hit with five out of eight ammonia plants idled during the summer arkansas georgia and texas were among other ammonia producing states affected the recent decline in gas prices and inventory however has sparked some ammonia producers into ramping up production triad nitrogen and pcs nitrogen both resumed full production in september at their respective plants in donaldsonville and geismar la industrial information reported terra industries restarted a verdigris ok plant after an extended shutdown and is expected to bring its blytheville ak plant online sometime this month koch industries and imc agrico with plants in sterlington donaldsonville convent and uncle sam la are now operating at partial capacity other ammonia manufacturers are waiting to see if natural gas prices remain stable before resuming production dupont in beaumont tx borden chemical in geismar la and pcs in augusta ga remain idled it looks as if these guys are going to make money running their plants all winter the duke energy ammonia industry expert said they are making less and less money as gas prices rise and ammonia prices fall i see them at the closest to breakeven by february where gas is averaging about two eight five last year the domestic producer margin was only about three ton he said they pretty much broke even in terms of gas costs on average this year they are probably going to make two zero two five ton of production at two eight zero mmbtu for gas and three four mmbtu of gas per ton of production plus two five ton of additional costs it will cost them about one two zero ton for ammonia production in new orleans they will probably cover that for most of the season,07:48:12,No

httpwwwceracomcfmtrackeprofilecfmufive one six six mone two seven two pressure in the north american gas markets remains intense despite moderate summer weather that so far has allowed storage injections to average over one zero billion cubic feet bcf per day high injection rates have provided occasional relief for prices but summer is far from over the absolute level of storage inventories remains critical and the prices should stay above the four zero zero per million british thermal units mmbtu level through august the competition between power generation and storage for supply will continue and gas prices must remain high enough to discourage marginal enduse demand and allow low storage inventories to build cera expects an average price of four two zero per mmbtu at the henry hub for august see table one which will result in continued burning of residual fuel oil by the atlantic coast dualfuel market and continued ammonia plant shutdowns which began during the may and june price increases although continued strong storage injections would take some pressure off the gas market a shift to a lower pricing planebelow four zero zero per mmbtudepends on sustained mild summer weather cera expects gas demand for power generation to climb through the end of july and into august and higher temperatures and power loads will limit supply that is available for injections the pressure in the market is likely to tighten over the weeks to come and the market will remain vulnerable to price spikes above four five zero per mmbtu through august and september gas storagenot yet enough despite recent high storage injection rates storage inventories are not high enough to ensure that supplies will reach adequate levels for next winter an end of mild weather in the midwest and northeast and seasonally intense heat in the southwest would cause injection rates to decline significantly over the remainder of july and into august the result would be injections averaging approximately nine zero bcf per day for july largely owing to higher rates early in the month and seven zero bcf per day for august see table two these rates would keep the yearoveryear inventory deficit above three five zero bcf for july and august with inventories on a path to reach between two seven and two eight trillion cubic feet tcf by the end of october still an alltime low level for the beginning of winter reaching even this level would require at least two of the following to occur a continuation of quite mild weather little or no hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico or warm weather through october as a result the pressure is likely to remain high in the gas market at least through august regional marketsthe topock premium buoyed by strong regional power demand and high utilization rates on pipelines into california topock continues to be the highest pricing point in north america high power loads in the west are supporting other prices in the region but supply growth and pipeline capacity constraints out of the rockies and high pipeline utilization rates between the san juan basin and california have maintained extremely wide differentials between those markets and california california should remain strong and cera expects some modest strengthening in rockies and san juan basis differentials during july and august with increasing pacific northwest gas demand for power generation see table three ceras outlook by region follows rockies continued strong supply growth in the rockies is challenging pipeline capacity out of the region and differentials have come increasingly under pressure this summer cera expects some modest recovery in rockies differentials as hydroelectric generation on the pacific northwest declines differentials should average zero five five per mmbtu for august san juan cera expects continued strong power loads in the west to keep san juan prices near current differential levels august differentials should average zero three five per mmbtu for august permian and midcontinent hotter weather and higher power loads in texas have already strengthened differentials at the permian basin and that tightening should hold through august the midcontinent should continue to price at a discount to permian supplies chicago chicago prices have held just above zero zero five above the henry hub for much of july a condition cera does not expect to change significantly during august chicago should average zero zero six above the henry hub northeast markets mild weather in the northeast quickly cooled price premiums from the midzero four zero s to the midzero two zero s from early to midjuly with hot weather still likely to return however new york prices for august should average zero three two above the henry hub canadian marketswestern supply no longer in decline although transcanada flows are down the strong market overall and wide differentials have resulted in increased flows on pgt up three zero zero million cubic feet mmcf per day yearoveryear domestic demand is still down slightly from last years levels storage injections have picked up in both the east and west and although behind last years are still above the fiveyear average western canadian supply increased slightly on a yearoveryear basis in june july thus far is basically running flat with last year the impact of the one nine nine nine transcanada capacity turnback and the current rate structure is beginning to be felt in the canadian market it is more and more apparent that transcanada is becoming the swing pipeline with flows four zero zero mmcf per day below last years levels the effect of the difference between contracted capacity available to shippers at incremental cost and uncontracted capacity available only on a fullcost basis is becoming evident with supply filling contracted capacity on export pipes the inability of transcanada to discount below the minimum interruptible rate may be creating a twotiered market this shift results in a different netback for holders of capacity similar to the higher netback achieved by the aggregators in the past and those without capacity those required to acquire full cost transportation or to sell at aeco this lack of flexibility is contributing to the wider differential between henry hub and aeco currently averaging in the high u szero seven zero s aeco is
