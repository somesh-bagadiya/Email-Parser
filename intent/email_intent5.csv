this provision we can net thetwo zero payments with respect to the same transaction due to our systemtwo zero incapability we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or mo retwo zero transactions in the same currency h agreed part five a if your suggested language is included a nondefaulting party has to two zero continue to make payment to a defaulting party with no payment obligation two zero which does not seem realistic we prefer to terminate transactions when an two zero event of default occurs we do not like to include the provision whichtwo zero releases a

master agreement i had a brief conversation this morning with john suttle credit and it two zero looks like hes going to insist on the csa we are going to talk tomorrow two zero and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments while wetwo zero have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of atwo zero master agreement the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy many two zero of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will havetwo zero trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents it would be two zero helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us atwo zero markup following are my points responsive to their revisions part one a the addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the two zero possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes fortwo zero example this would mean that if any enron affiliate went into bankruptcy two zero this agreement would be in default g this provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk two zero to the other party it should remain in place unless ibj can articulate a two zero reason to remove it part three the language inserted is much to vague our original version spells two zero out exactly what is expected of the parties if the documents we listed ar etwo zero not acceptable ibj should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we two zero agree we will put it in the agreement part four f by deleting the word not in this provision ibj is saying tha ttwo zero payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne ttwo zero ie if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating we each have to two zero make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o netwo zero payment this is not acceptable h if ibj will use their ny branch as agent we should use enron corp or e na part five a our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option totwo zero receive payments due even though technically in default under anothertwo zero provision of the agreement our position is that if there are no othertwo zero possible payment requirements due from the purchaser the option should be two zero honored c the section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same two zero city for many markets in which we participate it is very difficult if n ottwo zero impossible to find multiple market makers in the same citytwo zero e the change to one zero business days is much too long this means we can no ttwo zero have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks we can go two zero as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common markettwo zero practice g their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t otwo zero multiple enron companies if they default and only allows setoff with each two zero ibj branch as a separate entity this may not be an issue if we will never two zero trade or otherwise transact with them in any other enron company and if we two zero will never do business with any other branch of ibj we usually dont like two zero to restrict ourselves that way i we absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions if two zero there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu ttwo zero wholesale deletion is out of the question j as with part one g this section adds flexibility to both parties while two zero maintaining flexibility within the corporate family given the frequency two zero with which enron moves businesses around within the family this section is two zero important to us k this section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha ttwo zero went into bankruptcy and therefore default while they were in the money two zero we disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement without o urtwo zero revision we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds a rathe rtwo zero high rate given their status as a bankrupt we feel the nondefault rate i stwo zero more appropriate m i cant imagine why they wouldnt want this section included ittwo zero protects us both n you know more about this than i part six these are all important issues for us and we can discuss themtwo zero individually if they object for some articulated reason if these provisio nstwo zero are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation a two zero significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it two zero and we need

that no matter how serious your life requires you to be everyone needs a friend to act goofy with ive learned that sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a heart to understand ive learned

of you make sure you read all the way down to the last sentence there once was a little boy who had a bad temper his father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper he must hammer a nail into the back of the fence the first day the boy had driven three seven nails into the fence over the next few weeks as he learned to control his anger the number of nails hammered daily gradually dwindled down he discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into the fence finally the day came when the boy didnt lose his temper at all he told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper the days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone the father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence he said you have done well my son but look at the holes in the fence the fence will never be the same when you say things in anger they leave a scar just like this one you can put a knife in a man and draw it out it wont matter how many times you say im sorry the wound is still there a verbal wound is as bad as a

the week dealing with the most recent amendments to sb two eight x sb two eight x sherbattin makes various changes to the siting process including many iepsponsored proposals as you will recall two new provisions were added to the bill at the last minute before going to the assembly floor dealing with both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating facilities per the direction from iep member companies iep has decided not to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue if the provision remained in the bill iep would continue to push the republicans to hold their opposed position we were however given the authority to negotiate on the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that already have retrofit requirements i will be faxing out the agreed upon language which in essence says the arb shall set a schedule for the completion of any mandated retrofits it does not expand the authority of the air districts and arb to mandate retrofits under existing law the schedule would require completion of the retrofits by july one two zero zero four or such later date as the iso determines is necessary to maintain reliability with these amendments including some cleanup language sb two eight x will be votedon on the assembly floor on monday and go to the senate for concurrence on tuesday the final version will include the following iepsponsored proposals conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to clean air act requirements substituting ceqastyle hearings for the triallike proceedings of the ce c streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power plant sites giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed project improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency review extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process established in ab nine seven zero since sb two eight x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process iep member should now be thinking about what is next iep proposals still on the table include permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for power plants contingent upon cec ceqa compliance giving deference to other state and regional agencies easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements making the iso responsible for determining interconnection requirements bad news on the zero one california firstzero one eight issue quickly followed the good news the cec staff analysis which said the state cant require builders of new power plants to sell electricity here even as a tradeoff for expedited permitting was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can both documents cannot be obtained due to attorneyclient privilege this issue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the cec to include a california first clause on the approval of an expedited aes power plant project ab six zero x hertzberg which ties to the siting process the requirement that a developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified california entities is still poised to be heard in the senate energy committee iep members

remain more or less on vacation with my family upon return after new years akshay and i will look at the items in italics below of course we cannot do analysis out of the context of the model perhaps if you sent akshay and me the model that is being used to work the answers to jims questions one model or two we can see what were working with currently please note the following one merit order dispatch in the next rate caseattached below is what my team robert neustaedter has drafted for the rate case filing on merit order dispatch there is a mistake on page five regarding the percentage top that needs to pass outside merit order dispatch its seven five rather than seven eight further weve asked ramu to indianize the text before we pass it back to mr palumvar merit order dispatch has not been clearly treated by the merc or any other commission other than the gujarat erc and this filing should serve as a foundation for this rate case and others two merit order dispatch cap the may five two zero zero zero order treats two concepts as one the least cost purchase policy that determines what power purchase costs are included in the rates for the rate case period is equated with merit order dispatch which is a daytoday operational tool that determines actual purchases the rate case order of may five two zero zero zero as written did not cap the quantities what the rate case stated and i am not quoting was that quantities in addition to those authorized could be dispatched so long as the average realisation exceeded the cost i would also argue that the india obligation to serve customers provides additional grounds for further dispatch quantities the catch is in two places first whether dispatch of dpc power meets the test shubh told me recently it did does this continue to hold true mohan and second the recovery of the power purchase costs due to the variance the difference between what is authorized in the order and what is actually dispatched three recovery of variance according to mr podder the electricity supply act one nine four eight does not allow a carryover of these volumes from one rate case to the next typically the variance is just included in the next rate case this practice actually provides a utility with an opportunity to overrecover costs for a period of time which is why the goal of a rate case is normally to understate demand we have approached the mseb rate case however with a different perspective in an attempt to get the revenues up to allow more funds for mseb to pay its bills as provided in the act the variance must either be subsidised by the state or absorbed by the seb this is a major financial problem for the sebs and should be rectified by goi mr podder is writing down the accounting legal basis in act and i will forward that memo to you four mseb representation regarding dispatchmseb clearly discusses its failure to dispatch more than three zero four four mu with us in the rate case process mr palumvar and mr bakshi state that failure to dispatch additional quantities is simply a matter of budget the cost of three zero four four mu is incuded in the rates and the cost of additional volumes isnt since there is no way for mseb to collect the cost for additional volumes other than from the state it is logically not dispatching additional volumes five merc jurisdiction thus i have a query lets assume that the merc does not have jurisdiction to determine least cost purchases or merit order dispatch or to determine a blend of the two im not sure how that will help mseb to recover the full costs of its power purchases six logical area of focus in my opinion once sandeep katwala and team confirms our interpretation of the act the most beneficial course of action would be to work with the regulatorsgovernmentanyone else to repair the cost recovery mechanism of the act this helps dpc this helps mseb and will in the end help the country might be worth considering forwarded by

gurunathenron_developmentenron_development cc wade clineenron_developmentenron_development jane wilsonenron_developmentenron_development subject re dabhol question mohan i have gone through your note and agree with the concept you do have to compare enduser tariff with costs till enduser which will include td losses you have assumed three zero loss figures which is assuming little or no improvement since this is the worst case scenario your assumptions on rs devaluation are also aggressive as they need to be for a pessimistic scenario you have assumed that msebs average realization per unit in terms actually goes down due to rs devaluation there are some areas where jane can shed more light mseb can increase its average realization simply by limiting supply to agri customers and by not giving any new unmetered connections the latter is something that has been decreed by merc jane please correct me if i am wrong while the former was the most likely cause for bhaves exit jane can you with akshayas help take a crack at what the agricultural load and unmetered customers are likely to be in the years two zero zero two through two zero zero four similarly what is the likely growth in the metered cutomer categories also if dabhol were to be despatched to the load center at mumbai following mohans conclusion of seven five plf on two four zero zero mw and the plants close to chandrapur were to despatch less what would be the overall td loss picture the question to answer here is what portion of the three zero is theft and what is actual td loss my understanding is that betwen one six one eight is actual td loss due to the poor state of the network further we will have to ask the question whether the actual td loss is more due to distribution or due to transmission my gut feel is that it is due to distribution the next logical question to tackle then would be what you see as the improvement in distibution between now and two zero zero four jane can you take a crack at that mohan my gut feel is that there will not be a seven five despatch on all three blocks i can envisage that type of despatch in block b but that will be the optimistic rather than the pessimistic scenario i do not see c being used more than six eight hours daily and that too only in the peak season i had started the team working on a stack and peak and offpeak load curves we need to do more on that bottom line is that we need much more detailed information on the td sector on the pace of reform and most importantly on merit order deptaching of the plants building the stack of plants this was jims concern too when we met this morning and we will need to develop a plan to move that forward further regards sandeep mohan gurunath one two two zero two zero zero zero zero nine

more i was thinking about how to determine our worst case while considering this i came up with a question i couldnt answer what is our breakeven power price at the overall plf we think would be achieved if mseb used marginal economic cost dispatch if we determined that this price was at or above the realised tariff of mseb then we know ultimatley we will survive the only question is how long

2001-06-18,"[""'mmolland@brobeck.com'""]","[""'b..sanders@enron.com'"", "" 'c..williams@enron.com'""]",Enforcement of subpoenas by California Attorney General,this memorandum further analyzes the ability of enron and ees to remove to federal court a california state court proceeding to enforce a subpoena for documents and testimony it specifically addresses the arguments raised by the briefs filed by the reliant mirant and the california attorney general in april and may two zero zero one in litigation relating to a similar enforcement proceeding in reliant energy power generation inc et al v lockyer california superior court los angeles county case no bc two four eight six eight nine in light of the reliant case if ees removes an enforcement proceeding to federal court the ag will probably argue that the petition for removal is not a civil action because a petition to enforce the subpoena is a special proceeding and not an action we also anticipate that the ag will argue that there is no federal question because the government code sections provide an exclusive statutory scheme which provides jurisdiction only to the california superior court these arguments do not change our previous analysis but highlight the our conclusion assuming the existence of a federal question in the ags enforcement petition ees can file a petition for removal but its burden to prevail on a motion for remand will be difficult to meet i summary of reliant et al v lockyer in early two zero zero one lockyer served subpoenas for documents on reliant and mirant under government code sections one one one eight zero et seq reliant and mirant did not dispute the ags ability to seek this information and voluntarily produced nonconfidential information however reliant and mirant disputed the ags ability to disclose confidential information without a protective order several days before the ag as a petitioner filed an enforcement action in san francisco superior court to compel reliant and mirant to produce documents reliant and mirant affirmatively filed a complaint as plaintiffs for declaratory relief and an injunction in the los angeles superior court the ag filed a motion to dismiss the reliant action primarily on the grounds that the government code establishes the exclusive procedure for enforcement of this subpoena ie the ags filing of a petition to enforce the subpoena the government code does not allow for the filing of injunctive relief and granting an injunction would violate the separation of powers and circumvent the special proceedings of the government code on may one one two zero zero one the court denied the ags demurrer the ag then agreed to a compromise interim protective order and mirant and reliant produced requested documents while reserving rights to continue the litigation ii case or controversy under article iii as an initial matter we considered whether an enforcement proceeding constitutes a case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution we conclude it probably does the power of federal courts is constitutionally limited to cases and controversies see flast v cohen one nine six eight three nine two us eight three nine four this doctrine limits the courts to questions presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process id at nine five furthermore article iii is intended to define the role assigned to the judiciary in a tripartite allocation of power to assure that the federal courts will not intrude into areas committed to the other branches of government id applications of this doctrine include a finding of no justiciable controversy when the parties seek adjudication of only political questions when the parties are asking for only advisory opinions when the question sought to be adjudicated has been mooted by subsequent developments and where there is no standing to maintain the action id this is not the issue here upon the filing of a petition the ag will probably not dispute that there is a controversy the ag has conceded that as a matter of law there is no actual controversy in an investigatory proceeding until the attorney general moves to enforce the subpoena ag reply at nine we found no cases where removal of a similar petition was denied on the ground that it did not prevent a case or controversy under article iii iii removal of petition as discussed in our previous memorandum removal jurisdiction is conferred by federal statute see two eight usc one four four one a this statute provides in relevant part that except as otherwise expressly provided by act of congress any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction may be removed by the defendant or the defendants to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending as we previously concluded in order for ees to remove any enforcement action filed by the ag ees must show that one the petition is a civil action under the removal statute and two the ags investigation which underlies the subpoena enforcement action is preempted by federal law thus making removal proper on the basis of federal question removal jurisdiction the ag likely will argue that one that the petition to enforce the subpoena is not a civil action but rather is a special proceeding and two that the petition does not present a federal question because it is undertaking an enforcement procedure created by california statutory which grants exclusive jurisdiction to california courts these arguments are analyzed below a ags argument that petition is not an action first ees must show that a petition by the ag to enforce a subpoena is a civil action under federal law the definition of civil action is extremely broad and appears to cover everything except criminal proceedings in our previous memorandum we concluded that ees has a good faith argument that a petition is a civil action for the purposes of removal in reliant et al v lockyer filed in the superior court county of los angeles the ag argued that petitions under the government code are special proceedings not civil actions the ags arguments do not change our previous conclusions the ags arguments are founded solely upon language in see people ex rel franchise tax board v superior court one nine eight five one six four calappthree d five two six in that case the court of appeals stated that the hearing under section one one one eight eight is a special proceeding in practice the term special proceeding is used in contradistinction to action it refers only to proceedings which were not under the common law or equity practice either an action at law or a suit in equity they are proceedings which may be commenced independently of a pending action by petition or motion upon notice in order to obtain special relief id at five three eight despite the ags arguments franchise tax board has no weight in determining whether the petition is a civil action under the federal removal statute federal law determines whether there is an action is a civil action see eg in re exhumation of meriwether lewis nd tenn one nine nine eight nine nine nine fsupp one zero six six without a doubt the term civil action has been construed broadly by the federal courts wright miller one four b fed practice and proc juris three d three seven two one west one nine nine eight according to wright miller the limitation to civil actions is not particularly important however since the term civil action has been construed broadly by the federal courts for example proceedings for garnishment or condemnation and actions to compel arbitration or to confirm or vacate an arbitration award are considered civil actions within the meaning of the federal removal statute moreover special federal statutes permit the removal of certain noncivil proceedings in effect therefore the limitation to civil actions in section one four four one may mean no more than that state court criminal and perhaps penalty actions are not removable except as otherwise provided by a specific federal statute applying a broad definition of civil action courts have held that petitions to exhume a body petition to enforce administrative subpoenas garnishment actions actions to compel arbitration and contempt proceedings are civil actions within the scope of section one four four one see eg agosto v barcelo d p r one nine eight four five nine four f supp one three nine zero one three nine two enforcement of administrative subpoena overruled on other grounds one st cir one nine eight four seven four eight ftwo d one lewis v blackmon s d miss one nine nine four eight six four f supp one garnishment action sears roebuck and co v glenwal co sdny one nine seven zero three two five f supp eight six action to compel arbitration reynolds metals co v crowther d mass one nine eight two five seven two f supp two eight eight two eight nine contempt proceeding in re exhumation of meriwether lewis nine nine nine f supp one zero six six one nine nine eight petition to exhume body moreover the cases relied upon by the ag support the notion that the proceedings to enforce the subpoena are akin to an action see people ex rel franchise tax board v superior courtone nine eight five one six four calappthree d five two six in hearing on petition under the government code court may judicially test whether the subpoena duces tecum conforms to the requisite legal and constitutional standards fielder v berkeley properties co one nine seven two two three calappthree d three zero hearing on petition to enforce a subpoena provides an opportunity for adjudication of all claimed constitutional and legal rights before one is required to obey the subpoena the ag also relies on triple a machine shop inc v california one nine eight nine two one three calappthree d one three one this case is inapplicable triple a has nothing to do with the application of the government code at issue or the enforcement of subpoenas under the government code rather triple a analyzed the propriety of enjoining criminal investigations in that case the san francisco district attorney and the state department of health commenced a criminal and civil investigation into violations of law governing the storage and disposal of hazardous waste the district attorney obtained a search warrant the district attorney also brought a suit to enjoin defendants from dissipating any assets defendant filed an action for injunctive relief to enjoin the state from contacting high level managerial employees in violation of attorney client privilege and in violation of their ethical duties the injunction was issued the court of appeals reversed holding that there was no threat of misconduct by the district attorney or violations of the attorney client privilege the court further stated that the most significant effect of the injunction lies in its impact on the investigation and prosecution of the criminal charges the separation of powers doctrine requires judicial restraint in enjoining criminal investigations or prosecutions the discretionary authority vested in the district attorney to investigate and prosecute criminal conduct is considered too vital to the interest of public order to be subjected to prior restraint by the courts except under extraordinary circumstances id at one four five emphasis added ees is not asking the court to enjoin the ags investigation ees is merely invoking the jurisdiction of the federal court pursuant to the federal removal statutes in order to litigate the legal and constitutional issues related to the ags subpoena thus triple a is inapposite b the petition must present a federal question second ees must also argue that a federal question appears on the face of plaintiffs wellpleaded complaint or that plaintiffs artfully pleaded complaint involves a federal question as in the currently pending civil lawsuits ees will argue that the ags investigation or some of it is completely preempted by the federal power act which governs wholesale energy prices and thus presents a federal question without a doubt this presents the biggest obstacle to successful removal especially since ees cannot inject a federal question sufficient to justify removal by way of defense this burden may be somewhat easier for enron or enron wholesale services to meet since neither company does business on the retail level in california as ees does however as discussed in our previous memorandum both ees and enron must contend with contrary ninth circuit precedent see lewis v younger nine th cir one nine eight zero six five three ftwo d one two five eight in addition the ag will argue that the petition does not present a federal question but is merely seeking to enforce a subpoena under the provisions of the government code which provides the exclusive means for adjudicating any dispute relating to an investigatory subpoena we will better

overview of the situation based on the governors comments overview we made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees his staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea he talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers including utilityowned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a costplus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at three zero zero zero mw he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by zero two and provide

rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities he was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding ldc gas purchases as already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities his ideas the gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming some of these ideas would require legislative action state may build or make buildtransfer arrangements a couple of generation plants the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases this was a frequently recurring theme utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a costplus basis to consumers municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in california state universities including uccsu and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation expand instate gas production take state lands gas royalties in kind negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies empower an existing state agency to approvecoordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how nordpool worksjeff someone in schroeders group should be able to help out here wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new instate generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators securitize uncollected power purchase costs to dos jeff again id like to prevail on you to assemble the groups thoughts and get them to kari he wants to see five year fixed power prices for peak offpeak and baseload not just the five one year strips he wants comments on his proposals by tuesday he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues thanks to everyone for their help we made some progress today,02:14:00,"Yes

zero border_copyjpg news item from reuters the federal government has reached a deal with a c oalition of energy companies to build a transmission line in central califo rnia under a three zero zero million project to relieve a chronic bottleneck in moving electricity supplies between the northern and southern parts of the state construction on the socalled path one five project which was announced by ener gy secretary spencer abraham will begin in the spring of two zero zero three and could be completed by as early as summer two zero zero four two zero analysis the california energy crisis which clearly subsided over the sum mer of two zero zero one due to new generation that came online in the state mild weath er patterns and conservation efforts is generally considered the result of a severe supply demand imbalance while this may be true what often get s overlooked is that deficient transmission capacity in the statethe lines that actually transport power from point a to point balso played a primar y role in creating the tremendous instability of californias energy market this problem still persists today and as california heads into the winte r season concerns about power reliability once again are surfacing the dep artment of energy doe has stepped in to correct the problem by overseeing a massive upgrade to californias main transmission line while this is a positive step the upgrade creates a new level of state federal disputes for california and also puts ownership of the new transmission line into th e hands of private companies which creates a whole new set of potential co nflictstwo zero amid a long list of uncertain ramifications of the path one five upgrade there a re some things that we know for sure first path one five which is owned by pac ific gas electric co is a nine zero mile highvoltage section of transmission capacity that essentially carries power between northern and southern calif ornia during the peak of the energy crisis in california path one five became r ather clogged and suffered from bottlenecks points at which transmission c ould not transport high volumes of power this preempted any transport of power from southern california and arizona and mexico to the north whic h resulted in rolling blackouts in san francisco and other northern califor nia cities as noted these bottleneck problems remain and are particularly acute during times of peak power demand which is obviously a concern as w inter approachestwo zero the deficiency of the california transmission systems is arguably the last piece of the puzzle that remains toward bringing stability back to the stat es energy market ironically power supply is no longer seen as an imminen t problem new reports from the california iso indicate that the state shou ld have operating reserves of between two zero zero zero and two two zero zero mw this winter which has been deemed sufficient to stave off problems that plagued the previous winter season however the report on the states transmission system is n ot as positive if the northwest continues to experience a drought then no rthern california will still need to import more power from the south heav y dependence on the strained path one five could once again cause reliability pro blems for californiatwo zero thus deficiencies along path one five can be seen as a symptom of larger problem s that continue to plague california and problems that have been the focus of both state and federal intervention for months if not years in fact there is a history here that is worth noting especially as it relates to f ederal state jurisdiction when president bush released his national ener gy plan in april of this year he directed the doe to explore efforts that would relieve congestion along path one five following through with this order energy secretary abraham issued a request for proposals that elicited respo nses from one three companies interested in participating in the expansion of path one five the current contract which will add a new line to the existing path one five is the result of that previous directivetwo zero at present it appears that pge corp nyse pcg the parent of pacific g as electric co and six other companies have signed on to financially su pport the upgrade the six other companies that will spearhead the project are the transmission agency of northern california transelect inc kind er morgan power co pge national energy group williams energy marketing and trading and the western area power administration wapa a federal ag ency within the doe that sells electricity from water projects in one five wester n states and operates one seven zero zero zero miles of transmission linestwo zero presently path one five connects the bay area in northern california to two of t he states largest generation facilitiespacific gas electric cos diabl o canyon nuclear facility and duke energys morro bay naturalgas power pla nt the upgrade will reportedly include a new five zero zero kilovolt line that would boost transmission by about one five zero zero mw from these two plants further when t he upgrade is finished in two zero zero four path one five should be able to carry a total of five four zero zero mw of powertwo zero of course the first question that i asked was who is going to pay for the upgrade the way it appears at this writing is that the wapa will retain one zero percent ownership of the new line for its role as project manager and for acquiring the rights from property owners to hold the power line the rema ining nine zero percent will be owned by the private companies that are devoting d ifferent amounts of capital to fund the upgrade the exact percentages of i nvestment and ownership have yet to be defined but should be revealed in a subsequent plan outlined in the next nine zero days you may ask why these comp anies would want to participate in a transmission upgrade in california th e answer is that the companies will be able to recoup their investments thr ough fees charged to use the new transmission line this could result in a hefty payoff for the companies investing in the project who presumably ant icipate that california will remain a highdemand state through which huge amounts of power will need to be transportedtwo zero as i mentioned there are some potential conflicts that might arise with th is upgrade plan first there is the issue of potential state federal reg ulatory conflicts presently state governments have jurisdiction over powe r line siting thus the california public utilities commission cpuc had already been pursuing its own upgrade plan for path one five prior to secretary a brahams call for privatecompany bids specifically the cpuc had directed pacific gas electric co which it regulates to upgrade the bottleneck spots along path one five as seems to be a growing occurrence we may find that there is a state federal jurisdictional dispute regarding which regulator y body has the authority to direct and manage transmission upgrades in cali fornia gov gray davis and the cpuc certainly seem to believe that it is t he states prerogative and have issued strong criticisms over the does ve nture into this territory however in his energy plan president bush seem ed to support a change in policy that would allow federal officials to obta in transmission rights of way as a way to increase national transmission ca pacity if there is indeed a dispute between the cpuc and the doe it is no t known if federal policy would supersede state policy in this area in any event representatives from transelect one of the participating companie s have said that balancing the various interests among federal and state and public and private interests will be one of the key challenges for the upgrade project note that transelect was the company that had unsuccessf ully attempted to purchase the transmission assets of southern california e dison earlier this yeartwo zero also viewed by some as a potential conflict with the does upgrade plan for path one five are the difficulties that could arise with private ownership of a major piece of californias transmission grid the doesponsored upgrade u nlike the one that the cpuc has directed reportedly would not be subject t o review or approval by either the california iso or the cpuc further bec ause the companies participating in the upgrade will own a portion of the n ew line these companies will be able to charge tolls to the power market ers that use the lines to transport power this is most likely a point of c ontention for california officials especially gov gray davis who has sou ght state ownership of existing transmission lines and is not too keen on p rivatecompany ownership of generation facilities in the state the positiv e side of this issue is that according to the doe the bids from private c ontracts enable the upgrade of path one five to proceed without any increase to either the taxpayers or ratepayers of california or the united states of am ericatwo zero as a side note in addition to path one five the cpuc is also proceeding with a n ew transmission line in southern california known as the valleyrainbow in terconnect transmission line although the timetable has been delayed until two zero zero five san diego gas electric is proceeding with a five zero zero zero zero zero volt transmiss ion line that would connect southern california edisons valley substation near romoland calif with a future substation to be located in the rainbo w calif area just south of the riversidesan diego county line the new transmission line would provide a second interconnection between sdges an d sces transmission systems the first interconnection is at the san onofr e substation near san clemente calif the project is designed to deliver a pproximately one zero zero zero mwtwo zero moreover the expansion of path one five is a necessary step to help california l ower its risk for further reliability problems due to generation developme nt the imminent threat of the california energy crisis has diminished but the state is still wrestling with an equally important mix of risk factors the state government still has its hand in power purchases which represe nts a huge part of the states energy market the state has accrued one two five b illion in debt to buy power for the states utilities the recovery for whi ch remains an unresolved issue while gov davis has preferred to increase the states role in californias energy

bush began his first visit as president to the most populous state which he lost by roughly one two percentage points in novembers election the visit seems likely to showcase the clash between two very different energy strategies and political strategies mr bush will meet briefly on tuesday with gov gray davis who will insist as he did again today that the federal government impose price caps on wholesale electric power the white house says mr bush will refuse again he will argue that such caps would only discourage increased production of electric power we think thats a mistake vice president dick cheney said on friday talking about why he rejected those options when he prepared the energy policy the administration made public one zero days ago but mr bush knows that how he handles the california energy crisis could prove critical to his political fortunes especially now that his partys loss of control in the senate seems bound to slow or derail passage of major elements of his energy plan moreover the president can no longer argue that the best cure for high energy prices is a tax cut because that is now legislative history as one of his aides said this weekend after congress approved the one three five trillion tax cut that will be phased in over the next one zero years we will have to turn now to the other arguments most of those arguments involve urging the rest of the country not to follow california in a partial deregulation of the market with disastrous results repeatedly mr bush has chastised californias politicians and by implication mr davis himself for ignoring politically unpalatable choices to avert the states powergenerating crisis ten days ago standing in front of a hydroelectric plant in pennsylvania mr bush used the state as exhibit a for his argument about what happens when population rises when overregulation freezes the construction of new power plants and the stringing of new transmission lines and when politicians fail to plan for the long term the problems in california shows that you cannot conserve your way to energy independence mr bush said then at the same time his aides were pointing to polls showing mr daviss approval ratings plunging they did not mention that mr bushs ratings in the state were hardly any better a series of recent polls show that roughly twothirds of californians believe mr bush should be doing far more to help the state though it is unclear exactly what kind of help they have in mind so mr bushs aides have been struggling for days to choreograph the twoday visit here trying to find ways to differ with mr davis without seeming callous about the problem or in conflict with the state the betting is that mr bush will focus on longterm solutions in contrast to mr daviss call for the quicker fix of price caps the effort started today energy secretary spencer abraham issued an order of chiefly symbolic importance saying his department would move quickly to determine whether investors were interested in financing and coowning a new transmission line that could bring more power to the state the level of interest will be a factor in the decision to build the line later this year the energy department said it said that it would proceed with studies of how the land could be acquired by eminent domain if necessary and that it would speed ahead with environmental reviews but mr abraham left wide open the question of whether washington would go ahead with the project even if no private financing was available the bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a longneglected problem in californias electricity transmission system mr abraham said californias electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight however we can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year the statement was clearly intended as a prelude to the meeting with mr davis which will be closed to the press so will a meeting with energy entrepreneurs mr bush passed on mr daviss suggestion of a forum with smallbusiness owners and residents who have seen the lights go out few expect mr bush or mr davis to change his mind about energy caps after their meeting but for mr bush it will not all be tough love on tuesday morning mr bush is scheduled to travel to camp pendleton to repeat his call for the military and other federal users of power in california to flip off their switches whenever possible but given his own comments and mr cheneys about the limited utility of conservation that order could strike some californians as a little hollow later he will give a trade speech in los angeles underscoring the message that if california hopes to remain the worlds greatest exporter of high technology if it were a nation california would be the worlds sixthlargest economy it must find new ways to produce and deliver electricity already leading silicon valley companies are threatening to build their nextgeneration chip fabrication plants elsewhere probably in texas which has a surplus of generating capacity a move that would further undermine mr daviss stewardship in fact mr bushs texas roots will never be far from the political battlefield here mr davis has accused texas energy companies of profiteering at californias expense to press the case he has hired two political operatives from the clinton white house marc d fabiani and chris lehane who are being paid tens of thousands of dollars a month to make the case for price caps californias attorney general bill lockyer also a democrat suggested to the wall street journal last week that some time in jail would be the best way to deal with one of mr bushs biggest supporters kenneth lay

quarrel over unpaid bills enron corps indian power project dabhol power corp has rejected a check valued at two nine one million from its only customer the maharashtra state electricity board to make a legal point dabhol also delivered a sharply worded fourpage letter to the mseb responding to the electricity boards decision last week to rescind its powerpurchasing contract based on a claim that dabhol misrepresented its rampup speed the time the plant takes to go from a cold start to full power we deny that dpc have practiced any misrepresentation dabhols letter says furthermore we do not think that the mseb entertains any honest belief in its own allegation it says its the latest in a series of rancorous exchanges as both sides try to gain an edge in a fight over dabhols power tariffs the three billion power plant is the largest foreign investment in india and the dispute is closely watched as an indicator of indias hospitality to investors from abroad india needs electricity badly but many of its state electricity boards are cashstrapped due to widespread power theft and lax metering the dabhol dispute started about six months ago when the mseb defaulted on monthly bills totaling four eight million dabhols critics claim its tariffs are unreasonably high which dabhol denies among other things dabhol says mseb draws only about one five of the plants capacity down from an average six zero or so before the dispute the reduced usage boosts the perunit price because the pricing formula includes some capital costs in its letter dabhol says it rejected the one three six nine billionrupee check because it came with a note saying it was submitted under protest a reference to the msebs decision last week to rescind the contract the mseb cannot have it both ways says the letter signed by enron executive k wade cline either its rescinding the contract or it is affirming the validity of the contract by making payments however mseb chairman vinay bansal said that after the check was rejected the mseb went ahead and directdeposited a payment to a dabhol account unaware of the letters contents mr bansal said that he hadnt read the letter yet so he wouldnt comment on it he said the mseb is eager to pay because the april bill was due on friday a dabhol official while unable to confirm whether payment was received said it would mark the first time in history that the mseb has paid on time mr bansal disputed that saying he believes the two previous bills were also paid on time copyright two zero zero zero dow jones company inc all rights reserved may two nine two zero zero one houston chronicle el paso corp a villain or scapegoat in calif crisis californians ire grows as case resumes by david ivanovich copyright two zero zero one houston chronicle washington bureau washington the lights keep going out in california and people there want someone to blame california is pointing the finger at texas energy companies and first up is houstons el paso corp the california public utilities commission has accused el paso of using its power in the natural gas market to drive up gas prices in california that behavior californians say has cost the states consumers more than three seven billion in higher energy bills and exacerbated californias dire power woes and they want the federal agency that regulates natural gas pipelines to force el paso to hand over the profits from this deal at issue is whether el paso the nations largest gas pipeline company violated federal law by purposely withholding capacity on the biggest gas pipeline serving southern california during a crucial period when gas demand was on the rise last year by refusing to make that space available the state agency alleges el paso was exercising its market power to artificially hike prices and keep them high el paso counters that the runup in gas prices was caused not by its actions but by an unanticipated and unprecedented surge in demand and they argue the real problem is pipeline capacity constraints within california not on the supply of gas moving in pipelines bringing gas to the state when filed more than a year ago the states allegations went all but unnoticed by the public but with blackouts expected to roll across california repeatedly this summer the el paso case has morphed from an esoteric regulatory dispute into the test case for the legal battles spawned by the states power debacle as they wait in darkened elevators and struggle to pay soaring utility bills californians discern a pattern argues bruce cain director of the institute of governmental studies at the university of california at berkeley its the same story with slightly different details cain said and people in california are getting very very irritable gov gray davis and other democratic leaders have repeatedly blamed outofstate energy firms for the states energy woes and they have excoriated the federal energy commission for failing to take decisive action to give californians relief as president bush visits california today democrats are pointing to the el paso case to show how companies from texas are ravaging california whether el paso is an appropriate target for their anger remains an open question el paso operates a major pipeline system that transports natural gas from producing basins in areas such as west texas and oklahoma to southern california and other parts of the southwest for years the states two cashstrapped utilities pacific gas electric and southern california edison and a local gas distribution company southern california gas owned the rights to transport gas along the edison pipeline system but as california moved to deregulate its electric industry and encourage competition the california public utilities commission prodded the utilities to give up their capacity on the el paso line that made room for other gas marketing firms to move in houstonbased dynegy held the rights to the pipeline capacity for a while then an enron affiliate took a brief turn in february two zero zero zero el pasos pipeline arm el paso natural gas co opened the bidding again for about one two billion cubic feet of pipeline capacity that space accounted for about onethird of the capacity of the el paso line and about onesixth of the total pipeline capacity running into california an el paso affiliate el paso merchant energy co won the rights to that capacity for one five months with a three eight five million bid the california public utilities commission cried foul and asked the federal energy regulatory commission to force el paso merchant to disgorge its profits earned under the contract el paso has earned one eight four million in pretax profits since the contract began ralph eads president of el paso merchant testified last week the case was turned over to curtis l wagner jr an administrative law judge at the federal energy regulatory commission who acknowledged it would be a bellwether case this much was clear gas prices skyrocketed at the california border last year rising from an average of two eight four a thousand cubic feet in march two zero zero zero to as high as two five zero eight in december according to southern california edison that was no small issue for californias troubled power market because nearly onequarter of electric generators in california are fired by natural gas in making their case california officials pointed to the difference between gas prices in the gas fields in the san juan and permian producing basins and in california at the other end of the el paso line those price differentials began to widen while dynegy held the capacity state officials said only to expand dramatically after el paso merchant took control el paso merchant admits significant portions of its capacity went unused and the company acknowledges it was not successful at finding other players to take the space despite the interest of several potential bidders california officials insist the company only went through the motions of trying to find other shippers to take the pipeline capacity because it wanted to limit supplies perhaps the most tantalizing evidence in the case surrounds a valentines day two zero zero zero presentation made by el paso merchant officials to el paso chief executive william wise the el paso merchant documents are still largely held under wraps by the court although portions have been revealed and others were obtained by the new york times in those documents el paso officials acknowledged the deal for the pipeline capacity would give the company more control over gas markets including the ability to influence the physical market the times reported lawyers for the plaintiff tried to argue that el paso officials had crossed over the invisible line that is supposed to separate the operations of the regulated gas pipeline business and the unregulated gas trading arm wagner grew irritated with eads last week when the el paso merchant executive appeared to equivocate when asked whether wise approved merchant energys plans i feel youre trying to pull something over my eyes which i dont appreciate wagner said adding you have to get my blood pressure up to get the truth out of you wagner responded by ordering wise to fly to washington for an unscheduled appearance on the witness stand wise conceded he had indeed approved el paso merchants plan to make a bid for the pipeline capacity although he said he left it up to el paso merchant managers to decide the specifics of that bid for el pasos part harvard university professor joseph kalt argues that the real problem is a lack of capacity on the systems inside the state of california in other words even if el paso had delivered more gas along the pipeline the intrastate pipeline network would not have had the capacity to take that gas to users there eads also argued that if el paso officials had been trying to push up gas prices they would not have used a risk management technique known as hedging hedging allows a company to protect itself against a major drop in prices but it also keeps it from reaping the full benefits of a jump in prices el paso merchant had suffered six nine one million in hedging losses through march three one including four two nine million in the first quarter of this year if we had thought that we could drive up prices we certainly would not have hedged eads said and as for the infamous valentines day el paso officials insist the comments were misconstrued although they still want those documents to be kept secret testimony in the case will resume today wagner plans to issue his opinion by june three zero enron india no comment on power tariff cut reports zero five two nine two zero zero one dow

zero one kasturi sons ltd ksl source world reporter tm asia intelligence wire it always looked as if the maharashtra government had a definite plan while renegotiating with dabhol power company read enron the plan perhaps was to get some cosmetic changes in tariff and give dpc large benefits such as sales tax exemption for naphtha reduction in interest rates of loans and third party sales in the hope of getting the centre to make ntpc and other central utilities buy the costly power this would look as if the contract has been renegotiated to ease the burden on maharashtra when in fact the burden would have been distributed among several states and the centre the ultimate beneficiary would be enron which would continue to keep a contract executed so blatantly against public interest the real objective of the maharashtra government and perhaps the centre is to give the controversy a decent burial the party was spoilt by a statement by the nationalist congress party president mr sharad pawar criticising the re negotiating committee chairman mr madhav godbole the latter resigned but was convinced to retract it but it cannot be forgotten that it was mr pawar as chief minister of maharashtra who had bypassed a lot of objections to give the project to enron now it has become convenient for the maharashtra government to say that the state is suffering because of the decisions of the bjpshiv sena government while the role of the bjpshiv sena government in reopening and permitting phase ii and integration of the lng terminal by which means enron can recover the capital costs many times over is utterly deplorable it can not be lost sight of that it was mr pawars government that brought in enron as mr praful patel rightly said in star news newshour the project had the blessings also of the then prime minister mr p v narasimha rao and his finance minister dr manmohan singh all of them pushing for reforms wanted a project in doublequick time and they ignored the several layers of approval process the real story is described in a civil suit filed in one nine nine five by the then bjpshiv sena government in the bombay high court it is another matter that this civil suit was mysteriously withdrawn after the enron head ms rebecca mark met the powers that be in maharashtra including the shiv sena chief the suit drafted by such eminent lawyers as prashant bhushan nitin pradhan c j sawant the then advocate general and f s nariman tells the interesting story of how the pawar government went out of its way to favour enron by giving approvals even after the elections were announced and conducted in the state a gross violation of the election code to this day neither the congress nor the bjpshiv sena nor the ncp governments has had the courage to speak the truth perhaps because all of them were beneficiaries here are a few passages from the suit to judge the actions of the pawar government a after the calling of elections for the maharashtra state assembly after expiry of its full term the following documents came to be executed namely i amendment to ppa dated two two one nine nine five ii consent agreement dated two three two four two one nine nine five and iii fuel management agreement dated two five two one nine nine five as mentioned above all the aforesaid documents were in aid of and supportive of the ppa dated eight one two one nine nine three later amended as mentioned above elections were called for by a press note dated eight one two nine four and a notification date one zero one nine five and were held from nine one two february one nine nine five but announcement of results was deferred in order to complete election process in other states which were to take place it was this deferment of results which was taken advantage of and the lettersagreements were executed andor exchanged during this period a by reason of clause two of ppa the status of the ppa was that of an agreement not enforceable by law until all conditions precedents had been fully satisfied andor bona fide waived as provided in the ppa itself however by a letter dated two five two one nine nine five these conditions precedents were waived the socalled waiver was not bona fide but was deceptive and fraudulent the unholy haste with which the purported financial closure was sought to be achieved was clearly in order to reap the benefit of the huge sum of two zero million admittedly already spent by the principal shareholder of the first defendant enron described by them euphemistically as educational expenses the testimony of ms linda powers specifically states that moreover our company spent an enormous amount of its own money approximately two zero million on this education and project development process alone not including any project costs why do we and other developers include such things in our project to win local support and support of the authorities and contribute to the general improvement of conditions and contribute to the general improvement of conditions in the area in the purported refutation also enclosed in the letter dated one eight eight one nine nine five of the first defendant it is stated that two zero million included engineering financing legal travel and administrative costs actually totalling a sum in excess of two zero million as of two nine three one nine nine five two zero six one nine nine two within five days of arrival in india and within three days of arrival in bombay the enron team arrived in india on june one five and spent two days visiting various sites in addition to meeting people in delhi and bombay a memorandum of understanding was signed between the second defendant represented by mr ajit m nimbalkar then chairman of the second defendant ms rebecca mark of enron and mr douglas mcfadden of general electric corporation the term sheet annexed to the mou opens with the following electrical power purchase contract contract for two zero years term between power venture and mseb to be structured to achieve an all in price of us zero zero seven three kwh comprised a fixed monthly capacity payment calculating at the indian rate of inflation each year and a perkwh energy payment equal to the perkwh operating cost as defined below ii thus the purported decision to set up a huge power generation project in the private sector with a foreclosed obligation on a statutory corporation to buy power from the private sector at a predetermined unprecedentedly high rate was taken in a great hurry without there being any public debate on the said issue apart from there being any detailed consideration of the matter a before the ppa was executed in december one nine nine three the following events occurred a the world bank expressed its opposition to the project and advised that it was not viable not in the interest of maharashtra in particular and the country the public and the consumers in general this objection was brushed aside by enron which said in a letter that the world bank opinion can be changed that we enron will engage a pr firm and hopefully manage the media from here on june one nine nine three a the central electricity authority had drawn attention to several aspects of the mou including i the allin price is a departure from the existing norms and parameters notified by the government under section four three atwo of the electricity supply act one nine four eight ii denominating the price in us dollars is also a departure from the existing norms iii we take it that the price of zero zero seven three kwh will be applicable from one nine nine six when power would be available the ppa violates the tariff guidelines in force issued on december eight one nine nine three the tariff guidelines permitted only a return of one six per cent on equity but the ppa allows a return much in excess of two five per cent second the tariff notification puts a cap on operation and maintenance om charges at two five per cent of the capital cost in the case of the ppa the om changes were over rs nine zero crore annually which is over three per cent of the capital cost the ppa was not even structured in accordance with the said notification the tariff notification allows payments only for the actual fuel consumed and not for deemed consumption in the present case the heat rate guaranteed by the dabhol power company to the mseb is seven six zero five btu per unit while the heat rate guaranteed by gec to dpc is considerably lower under the ppa about two five per cent of this difference and deemed consumption and actual consumption is allowed to be retained by dpc contrary to the tariff notification all these are but a few paragraphs of the six zero zero page civil suit perhaps had the then maharashtra government persisted with the arbitration the compensation would have been far less than what could be anticipated now however for reasons best known to the bjpshiv sena combine the suit was withdrawn and its government appointed a review committee which integrated the lng plant with the power plant and gave the green signal for the second phase the net result was a higher tariff than what was negotiated by the pawar government the project has come a full circle now now the effort is on to distribute the burden across the country this is evident by the maharashtra government turning to the centre and its representative a v gokak and stating that the centre is evaluating various options including of the power trading corporation to buy the power from dpc and distribute it to all the states but at what price not lower than negotiated under the ppa of course with cosmetic concessions by enron and a lot of sacrifices by the state and the centre but is this what we want s padmanabhan

edf spain is acting under a new edf law intended to keep stateowned foreign groups from controlling its utilities the thinking behind it is similar to madrids restrictions on shareholdings by foreign telecommuications companies in which governments still hold a golden share the goldenshare law used to scupper a deal between spanish phone company telefonica and hollands kpn has been challenged by the european commission this is not what the european unions single market is supposed to be about the idea is to foster free movement of capital and investment between member nations not to give governments the excuse for nationalistic grandstanding and protectionism nor is edf is the kind of investor the single market was designed to encourage france is liberalising its electricity market more slowly than many other eu countries permitting only the minimum outside competition allowed under eu rules it also bans companies from taking a stake in edf in a sense edf is doing what state monopolies facing eventual privatisation always do moving into markets where liberalisation is further advanced and barriers to entry are lower it has a war chest overflowing from a high domesticprice policy and can snap up newly privatised shares of other former monopolies abroad or buy stakes in struggling newcomers that is what it has been doing in italy where the former state monopoly enel is being forced to sell off capacity much would have gone to montedison but it may go elsewhere if edf is seen to be in control eventually eu pressure to liberalise will mean edf will have to face serious competition on its domestic market some market opening has already been forced on it despite the best efforts of the french government the company says it has already lost four eight clients representing roughly three per cent of sales to the benefit of the german companies rwe and eon americas enron spains endesa the francobelgian company electrabel and upstart french rival suez reports the paris daily le monde it will also have to put a further six zero zero zero megawatts or six per cent of production up for sale later this year as a condition for eu approval of the enbw purchase but that is not enough to satisfy its neighbours who want edf tamed at least for as long as it remains under state protection the eus commission would dearly like to be able to agree commission president romano prodi a former italian prime minister uncomfortably admits brussels needs to study what can be done about companies which can buy but cannot be bought commissioner for energy loyola de palacio who happens to be spanish has argued fiercely there is no point in privatising state companies only to have them renationalised by someone elses government nonetheless the commission has taken spain to court over the goldenshares law and is investigating the decision against enbw and edp mr prodi has also signalled he will also look very closely at the italian law fearing the battle could reverse years of painful effort to liberalise the utilities market the commission argues it is better to pressure paris to open the french market than to let rome and madrid close theirs that is correct in principle market liberalisation is a fundamental pillar of european integration and national barriers cannot simply be reerected at the first sign of crossborder investment in practice however the italian and spanish reactions may be rather more effective at concentrating french minds than lectures from brussels if edf finds its foreign forays thwarted it may decide for itself that

two zero zero one washington after keeping his distance from california for months president bush finally will travel to the golden state today to confront an energy crisis that threatens to darken the futures of politicians on both coasts the trip comes at a time when the white house and californias democratic gov gray davis have been engaged in a crosscountry war of words each blaming the other for the states rolling blackouts and escalating energy prices prodded by nervous state republicans who fear voters are coming to see the white house as indifferent to the crisis bush will focus on energy problems during the twoday swing the trip tentatively includes a tour of camp pendleton marine corps base a speech to the los angeles world affairs council and a trip to sequoia national park perhaps most significant bush has agreed to meet with davis at the governors request to discuss their differences over how to resolve the energy crunch the stakes are high for both although bush and davis are of different parties political experts say voters in the nations most populous state could hold both of them responsible for a summer of inconvenience and high utility bills voters dont look at the energy crisis in an ideological mode said allan hoffenblum a los angelesbased republican consultant it is why cant i turn on my lights and why are my electric rates so high a recent poll by the public policy institute of california found that voters statewide gave both bush and davis low marks in the way they have dealt with the energy crisis the survey found five six percent of californians disapproved of bushs handling of the matter davis fared even worse with six two percent of respondents saying they are unhappy with his performance for many republicans bushs visit is not a moment too soon having lost all but one statewide elected position in their increasingly democratic state they have been eager to get a high profile republican there to rally the troops furthermore some political observers say davis latest strategy linking bush to the texasbased energy companies the governor charges are responsible for high prices is beginning to resonate with voters he is pointing his fingers at energyprice gougers in texas and gougers in houston said sherry bebitch jeffe a senior scholar at the university of southern california she was referring to recent attacks by davis and other democrats against houstonbased reliant energy and enron corp which have supplied energy to california until recently bush has been reluctant to return to a state where voters rejected him by a one two percentagepoint margin last november the big loss came despite the fact that bush campaigned hard there and pumped millions of dollars into a statewide effort since assuming office bush has traveled to more than half of the states before scheduling a trip to california and he has waited longer than any president in the last three decades to make his first visit to the golden state bill clinton who cruised to two california victories headed to the west coast after his first month in office and returned frequently critics say bush has been trying to avoid the energy mess which is the no one topic from san diego to san francisco initially white house advisers dismissed the states energy crunch as a selfinflicted crisis caused by a flawed deregulation plan when administration officials suggested that state officials solve their own problems democrats responded that the message from washington was bush to california drop dead but more recently the administration has sought to be more attentive to the energy shortage after california republicans warned of a possible voter backlash in the two zero zero two midterm elections bush ordered federal facilities including the sprawling military bases in the state to reduce energy consumption by one zero percent and he has directed the federal government to expedite permits for new power plants that the state desperately needs but the presidents longterm energy strategy unveiled this month did not address the states shortterm problems and the administration has adamantly rejected davis pleas to have the federal government cap the price of wholesale electricity in the state white house officials say price caps distort the market and would not solve the major problem facing california which they argue is not generating enough electricity to meet demand furthermore they contend price caps would even harm the state in the long run nevertheless davis spokesman steve maviglio said the governor will use his meeting with bush to once again request that the president approve a ceiling on electricity costs the governor wants to ensure there is some shortterm price relief by the administration said maviglio i think the longer the president stays in california he will hear at every meeting and at every turn about energy and price gougers so hopefully he will be compelled to do something about it instead of being awol about it white house spokesman ari fleischer disputed california democrats contention that the president has ignored the crisis the presidents focus is going to be on solving problems fleischer said he is not interested in fingerpointing and thats what the president has done on energy policy in this country whether people agree or disagree with the specifics of his energy plan however even the presidents longterm energy strategy which emphasizes more oil drilling and nuclear power plants may be in peril now that democrats have regained control of the senate following vermont sen james jeffords defection last week from the gop democrats already have said they are unlikely to approve some of bushs more controversial proposals such as drilling in the environmentally sensitive arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska the scuttling of such oildrilling plans is likely to be well received in environmentally conscious california said political expert jeffe she added that jeffords move also will benefit california because the states two democratic senators dianne feinstein and barbara boxer are likely to gain clout in the senate the senators have complained that the bush administration has not consulted them on energy policy recently the states democratic attorney general bill lockyer sharpened his attacks on enrons top executive ken lay

there are others including developer ed wulfe browns confidant and while these powerhouse names provide colorful speculation about the political scene two years hence they also cast long shadows on this years landscape because each now prefers brown to serve a final term the concern atop the glittering towers of commerce is that houston needs another businessman at the helm someone with the

working behind the scenes holmes lay and shapiro are taking stock of their political futures it is unlikely that they would would run against each other but each wants to know where he stands and who might make the best candidate holmes already has taken a step though he chaired fundraising for rob mosbacher who lost to brown in the one nine nine seven runoff that put brown in office holmes now raises money for the mayor that allows holmes to freeze money that might go to other candidates while earning political points from browns black supporters lay the chairman of enron corp is testing

candidacy from one of the three success will require balance a subliminal message to voters especially those in predominantly white west houston is to wait for two years if bell or sanchez wins defeating either could prove difficult after one term when problems can still be blamed on the predecessor for brown the challenge may be to convince these same voters hes doing his job well enough that they can afford to wait before replacing him everyone involved will be keeping a keen eye on the polls brown has maintained a strong though not insurmountable lead but in recent weeks hes whirled in a vortex of bad news that could drain his lead should browns support drop this summer it is not unimaginable that a business leader might jump in remember lanier didnt enter the race that eventually unseated kathy whitmire until august one nine nine one and in two years it now seems likely that houstons traditional white business establishment will offer up one of its own for mayor in either case political success will require a delicate balance of power money and subtlety lest the run appear as heavyhanded manipulation by lords of political largesse it assumes that a white male

more at stake than price caps davis and his administration want other things from washington from increased federal aid to help fight an insect threatening the wine industry to an exemption from a

both the president and the governor have been wounded their goal is to get the crisis off their back substantively we have a real crisis and it requires the involvement of the state and federal government davis was elected governor in a one nine nine eight landslide but he heads into his two zero zero two reelection campaign with plummeting poll numbers a field poll released last week showed

over whether it serves their interests best to emerge from the talks appearing to be allies or adversaries the public dislikes conflict and wants the problem of rising prices and threatened blackouts solved he said however as bush and davis were preparing for the meeting their aides could not even agree on who requested it first karen hughes counselor to the president said bush would listen to davis argument in support of price controls however she said the president still felt strongly that price caps would discourage investment in new power plants hughes disputed suggestions that the administration has neglected the state which bush lost to democrat al gore by more than one million votes he came up short in the vote on election day in california but he will not let that deter him from doing what is right for california she said he is the president of all of the people of the united states bush was thought by some political analysts to be reluctant to visit california until he had an energy proposal he could point to as a response to the states problems but white house officials say the presidents travel agenda during his first four months in office has been designed around legislative geography he spent most of his time on the road visiting states where senators might be persuaded to support his tax cut dan bartlett one of bushs communications advisors said the white house always has regarded california as an important destination for bush even if he will have visited two nine other states before he arrives here the state has difficult times ahead of it and its important the president and federal government help them through these difficult times bartlett said still meetings between presidents and governors particularly ones of opposing parties invariably become studies in oneupmanship thats particularly true when the governor is seen as a future presidential candidate when president clinton came to california the white house rarely if ever deigned to inform republican gov pete wilson on rare occasions when they would meetgenerally at outoftheway airportswhite house officials took pains to show who was in charge by changing meeting locations at the last minute for example or making sure that the presidents chair was taller than the governors wilsons relationship with clinton was more strained than davis is with bush the combative wilson repeatedly sued the federal government on issues ranging from voter registration requirements to demands for reimbursements for costs associated with illegal immigration it is smart of the bush white house to hold a meeting with gov davis said sean walsh a former wilson spokesman one need only look at davis background if the president didnt come davis likely would show up on the street with a milk carton with george bushs face plastered on the side so far davis has not sued over the energy crisis although democratic leaders of the legislature have gone to court to compel federal regulators to make sure interstate electricity rates are just and reasonable but the governor has been amping up his rhetoric he has retained consultants chris lehane and mark d fabiani veteran operatives from the clinton administration under a contract that will pay them three zero zero zero zero a month both are known for their attackoriented tactics on thursday davis called bush practical and wellintentioned at the same time he threatened to sue the administration if his meeting with the president fails to produce desired results give us relief find a way to give us relief davis implored and if the president continues to refuse to impose price caps were going to court then the law says were entitled to relief and it hasnt been coming we have a whole bunch of contingency plans even if the meeting produces no tangible results it will be an opportunity to tone down the rhetoric said assembly speaker bob hertzberg dsherman oaks you cant engage in a war with the president the speaker added because there are too many issues on which the state needs federal aid but bill whalen research fellow at stanford universitys hoover institution and a former wilson aide demurred you cant tell me that with

administration for not doing more to bring down energy prices before the trip was announced gop lawmakers from california appealed to bush to visit the state and counter democratic criticism of the administration the exchanges reached a new level of intensity when californias democratic attorney general bill lockyer suggested in an interview published by the wall street journal on tuesday that ken lay chairman of the texasbased energy company enron corp and a close friend of bush should be locked in a prison cell with a tattooed inmate named spike one political analyst said that perhaps it was time for sacramento and washington to exchange ambassadors some observers see little downside to davis attacksand the possibility of political gains for a governor whose popularity has declined significantly which do you think gray davis cares more abouthis dealings with washington or his reelection chances whalen asked because of its democratic tilt california was never going to be on the administrations a list for federal goodies said one washington lobbyist who works on california issues others however insist that the white house will not take actions designed only to punish california no matter how estranged bush and davis become bush is going to do whats right for california regardless of the governors remarks asserted rep george p radanovich rmariposa ultimately the safety net for the state is the republican delegation in congress said marshall wittmann a senior fellow at the conservative hudson institute they have the vested interest in ensuring that california gets its fair share even if bush and davis emerge from their summit shaking hands the public shouldnt assume they have become partners in peace in fact davis may have more to gain by aligning himself with another washington figure whose influence expanded dramatically last week when sen james m jeffords of vermont quit the republican party tipping control of the senate to the democrats davis does have a new friend in washington whalen said but its tom daschle the south dakota democrat who is about to become senate majority leader simon reported from washington and morain from sacramento times

one the times mirror company if political heat were light california wouldnt have any more rolling blackouts unfortunately gov gray davis and president bush are fighting to a draw leaving california and the broader national economy caught in the bickering middle as davis correctly argues bush could end californias crisis tomorrow by imposing firm and reasonable price controls on the western regions wholesale electricity market bush says that such price controls would discourage new power plant construction and make our problems worse lets take bushs argument first a small handful of large energy companies are manipulating the market from seattle to san diegoand laughing all the way to the bank these energy conglomeratesdynergy reliant enron williams and othersproduce power for as little as a nickel or a dime per kilowatt hour and sell it into the western states for prices spiking as high as a dollar during rolling blackouts the result is not only the transfer of tens of billions of dollars of wealth from consumers and businesses to the energy companies it is also a massive energy price shock that now threatens to pull the entire west coast and eventually the rest of the country into a recession bush could easily shortcircuit this recessionary shock by imposing a firm regionwide price cap of one five to two zero cents this would end the profiteering and still provide ample incentives for generators to supply power and build additional power plants moreover a regionwide price cap as opposed to a californiaspecific one would prevent generators from playing one state against another this does not mean however that davis is doing any better for california than bush nothing illustrates davis incompetence better than his botching of the states transmission grid purchase this option had a dual purpose provide cash to the nearbankrupt utilities to pay off creditors and get the system working again and wrestle back jurisdiction over the wholesale electricity market from intransigent federal regulators davis failed miserably in closing that deal with disastrous consequences california remains dependent on the feds pacific gas electric is in a bankruptcy court and southern california edison continues to hover on the brink of receivership worst of all the aborted transmission grid deal has left the utilities without adequate funds to pay off the states small generators and many are no longer willing or able to produce this is perhaps the most important but least understood aspect of the current crisis about seven zero zero small generators provide roughly a fourth of the states power davis bungling has led to the loss of more than three zero zero zero megawatts of that supply that means that when the lights go out and wholesale prices skyrocket it is not necessarily because of a physical shortage of electricity but because of an artificially induced financial shortage in hindsight it is clear that davis worst mistake was not seizing the plants of the merchant generators who were ripping off california months ago these generators bought the plants from the states utilities after deregulation for a mere three two billion since then they have used the plants to game the market by withholding supply partly through such scurrilous methods the generators have stuck californians with an electricity bill that may eventually reach one zero zero billion adding insult to injury davis is now using taxpayer money on several highpriced spin doctors and the democratic party is using millions on a media campaign to redirect the publics anger toward the bush administration and the republicans lets give the public credit it understands that it takes two politicians and two political parties to do the blackout tango copyright two zero zero zero dow jones company inc all rights reserved,01:11:00,No

discussed transmission planning and expansion the pane lists were jose degadoceo american transmission company michael dworkin chair vermont psc mark mahervp transmission business line bonneville power administration lara manzpseg masheed rosenqvistnational grid steve waltonenron general observations the commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time commissioners breathitt and massey were the most active in q uestioning the ferc staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions there w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights there was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the r to planning process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related all agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution two zero opening statements jose delgado atc is a transmission only company with miso as the system op erator they view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met they were formed by divestiture by ious coops and munis and with a five zero zero million asset base initially their current ten year plan will add one billion of in vestment their top priorities are connecting generation and load two zero michael dworkin because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party the environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view the ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although ferc has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by fcc state input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered mark maher ferc must consider the unique characteristics of the west when considering congestion management lmp is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations rto west is developing a planning pro cess which will give the rto the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future the rto needs a strong centralized planning process laura manz the various aspects of planning are connected pricing lmp i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources no competitor should have an advantage over another the rto ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions the market should decide on solutions two zero masheed rosenqvist the morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk the planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion the commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases the issues that need to be ans wered are how can merchant transmission be compensated should transmiss ion projects be open to rfps is ferc open to market based pricing for exp ansions two zero steve walton the most important thing for ferc to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment the rto debate has been going on for five years or more and needs to be settled for expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning for instance if a one three eight kv line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a three four five kv line should be built who pays for the extra cost in order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to ferc to decide such matters discussion kevin kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding michael dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning this lead to discuss ion of the need for the rto to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions two zero commissioner massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies the panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process michaela dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions l aura manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties dick oneil asked if lmp will work in the west mark maher said it wouldn t laura manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in pjm michael dworkin said lmp means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed bpa is looking pricing mode l but lmp wont work steve walton said lmp needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis pjm has hydro but not seven zero as in the northwest implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal in the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed one rto must provide information two rto should identify solutions three rto s hould be unbiased and four the rto should be accountable the disagreement was over the last two points michael dworkin felt that three unbiased was c ritical and that four accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance jose delgado said and transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the iso above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake this last point really comes down to a preference for iso over transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues steve,09:14:50,No

nine single a collegeeducated city dweller if so you may have also had the unpleasant experience of discovering that you have been identified by the us census bureau no less as one of the fastestgrowing groups in america the never marrieds in less than three zero years the number of nevermarrieds has more than doubled apparently pushing back the median age of marriage to the oldest it has been in our countrys history about two five years for women and two seven for men as if the connotation of never married werent negative enough the vilification of our group has been swift and shrill these statistics prove a titanic loss of family values according to the washington times an article in time magazine asked whether picky women were denying themselves and society the benefits of marriage and in the process kicking off an outbreak of sex and the city promiscuity in a study on marriage conducted at rutgers university researchers say the social glue of the family is at stake adding ominously that crime rates are highly correlated with a large percentage of unmarried young males although i never planned it i can tell you how i became a nevermarried thirteen years ago i moved to san francisco for what i assumed was a brief transition period between college and marriage the problem was i wasnt just looking for an appropriate spouse to use the language of the rutgers researchers i was soulmate searching like nine four percent of nevermarrieds from two zero to two nine i too agree with the statement when you marry you want your spouse to be your soul mate first and foremost this berromantic view is something new in a one nine six five survey fully three out of four college women said theyd marry a man they didnt love if he fit their criteria in every other way i discovered along with my friends that finding that soul mate wasnt easy girlfriends came and went as did jobs and apartments the constant in my life by default not by plan became a loose group of friends after a few years that groups membership and routines began to solidify we met weekly for dinner at a neighborhood restaurant we traveled together moved one anothers furniture painted one anothers apartments cheered one another on at sporting events and openmike nights one day i discovered that the transition period i thought i was living wasnt a transition period at all something real and important had grown there i belonged to an urban tribe i use the word tribe quite literally here this is a tight group with unspoken roles and hierarchies whose members think of each other as us and the rest of the world as them this bond is clearest in times of trouble after earthquakes or the recent terrorist strikes my instinct to huddle with and protect my group is no different from what id feel for my family once i identified this in my own life i began to see tribes everywhere i looked a house of exsorority women in philadelphia a team of ultimatefrisbee players in boston and groups of musicians in austin tex cities ive come to believe arent emotional wastelands where fragile individuals with arrested development mope around selfindulgently searching for true love there are rich landscapes filled with urban tribes so what does it mean that weve quietly added the tribe years as a developmental stage to adulthood because our friends in the tribe hold us responsible for our actions i doubt it will mean a wild swing toward promiscuity or crime tribal behavior does not prove a loss of family values it is a fresh expression of them it is true though that marriage and the tribe are at odds as many exgirlfriends will ruefully tell you loyalty to the tribe can wreak havoc on romantic relationships not surprisingly marriage usually signals the beginning of the end of tribal membership from inside the group marriage can seem like a risky gambit when members of our tribe choose to get married the rest of us talk about them with grave concern as if theyve joined a religion that requires them to live in a guarded compound but we also know that the urban tribe cant exist forever those of us who have entered our midthree zero s find ourselves feeling vaguely as if were living in the latter episodes of seinfeld or friends as if the plot lines of our lives have begun to wear thin so although tribe membership may delay marriage that is where most of us are still heading and it turns out there may be some good news when we get there divorce rates have leveled off tim heaton a sociologist at brigham young university says he believes he knows why in a paper to be published next year he argues that it is because people are getting married later could it be that we who have been biding our time in happy tribes are now actually grown up enough to understand what we need in a mate what a fantastic twist we never marrieds may end up revitalizing the very institution weve supposedly been undermining and theres another dynamic worth considering those of us who find it so hard to leave our tribes will not choose marriage blithely as if it is the inevitable next step in our lives the way middleclass highschool kids choose college when we go to the altar we will be sacrificing something precious in that sacrifice we may begin to learn to treat our marriages with the reverence they need to survive ethan watters is a writer living in san francisco

2000-12-22,"[""'terence.thorn@enron.com'""]","[""'rick.bergsieker@enron.com'""]",Oxy meeting,we just finished the meeting with dale laurance and casey olson heres a recap oxy wanted to meet with mike for two reasons one make sure enron and oxy had a project team in place asap and the resources are committed to do a world class job on the january two nine submission and subsequent presentations as mike noted we are in sudden death overtime and the two nine th could be the end of the tournament two revisit the street talk about enron redeploying capital mike walked through the egm organization talked about our stock multiple and how an announcement that we were putting huge dollars in saudi would hurt our stock price dale talked about their low multiple between four and five noted that the market viewed oxy as a company that could do deals buy and sell assets but really wasnt a growth company they now have a stable cash flow but need a new beach head in the middle east to demonstrate they are growing the point of this conversation was to tell us that debt reduction is also a top priority so they were also not interested in a big announcement about money being dumped into saudi arabia they characterized the saudi perspective as being one where they are looking for strategic partners who will be there for a long time and invest capital they agree on a division of labor oxy can do ep processing and petrochemicals and look to us for pipelines and power plants although oxy can do those too they realize that only enron has the marketing structuring and regulatory expertise casey did revisit his conversation with you about in the end enron ends up as some type of merchant banker thats ok in the end dale even said they would take over our part of any project but we cant project that role initially we need to be on the same side of the table as oxy the point here is that we have to be in step with a consistent approach to the projects they expect our competitors to say theyll finance things on balance sheet and we need initially to say the same thing although later we will open discussions on other ways to finance mike and i agree that this is probably the biggest sticking point in the discussion today oxy believes that such an initial statement will never be public and we arent really locked in an onbalance sheet approach maybe we can do this maybe we cant they see this as a year long process with pdas stretching well into next year and two zero zero two when the real money would be spent the short term crisis is january two nine and we need a submission with lots of pages we were criticized that although our proposal was well thought through and technically superb it didnt have enough pages reams of paper to impress the technocrats we will also need to prepare a smaller one five page digest to be used for our official february presentation and a three page walk around summary casey thinks the production center has to be in the us we also all agreed that the jan two nine questions allow us to lay out all of our downstream concerns and establish a placeholder for issues that must be resolved during the pda discussions before we would do a project i have had the greatest success around the world when we dont try to force immediately on a country a perfect gas or electric market but adapt to local conditions and implement the most important first couple of steps with the rest to follow later in this respect our projects can include suggested regulatory concepts that if successful can be used elsewhere in the kingdom over and over we came back to the project team which they want on the ground in saudi casey will be one zero zero saudi for the foreseeable future and can make all decisions who will be our lead person with the same authority they dont want to deal with someone who later says houston changed its mind a little arrogant when can we identify bodies and assignments and location they want full time dedicated people either dale or casey noted that the old enron would have parachuted a team in by now like south america where we landed in a swamp and spent the next five years beating alligators over the head with a stick this is a very complicated political and technical effort the leader has to be good at both casey was excited that rob would be assigned to the project i guess you discussed this with him they both were quick to say that the working relationship to date has been excellent and that they appreciate the effort we have put into this mike committed that we would go balls to the wall for the two nine th deadline i committed that i would designate a project team by the first week in january we had our first conference call yesterday but mike said he wanted to think about the decision point person and process we arent about to sacrifice a deliberative strategicconsensus thought process because they are in a hurry we spent a lot of time talking about the process we agree that the saudis will eliminate one or two participants that each project will have subparts with different combinations and leads of companies with a master jv on top they minimized the capital investment although they are prepared to spent two zero zero three zero zero million over the next three five years they see core project two costing six zero zero million six zero oxyenron assuming one other partner and enron half of that we arent talking billions spoken like a true major they are sure exxon mobil will be our red sea partner if only to earn face with possibly marathon as the other exxon is more interested in the chemical focus which oxy will concede to them mike noted was that our worst nightmare was a partner exxon who would throw away money just to have a presence we were assured that oxys only goal was to make money and if he projects didnt they would walk away the real danger in the upstream is the risk money for exploration oxy hopes to hedge this risk with downstream investments pipelines and plants and hopes that if the exploration is successful and reserves are added it will lead to a whole new series of projects they are very proud of oxys role in this claim that they were instrumental in getting petry parkman and morgan selected as advisors that irani is the most respected american arab business man and has great access in the kingdom and that they already know what investments partners are acceptable to the saudis we all left great friends in good christmas spirit from our perspective saudi is the largest economy in the middle east and the driver in international oil and liquids markets enron needs to get inside and establish relationships with the key saudi people we need a foot print in the kingdom with which to earn their respect can we do it with minimal capital investment saudi is about to embark of a complete electric and gas restructuring regulatory included they want the repatriation of petro dollars and dollars held offshore by saudi nationals the country can be a tremendous source of capital it looks like two zero zero one can be managed with a minimum burn rate with the most intense period of activity being in january we need to set up the team for the january effort ill have this done by jan one there is the question of sorting out conflicts with other me priorities although it may be too soon to answer we dont know yet what is possible but we can shape that outcome what is the end game what do we want out of saudi arabia we seem to have a clear division of labor and strategy with oxy although we need to sort out what we say about on balance sheet financing we also need to keep in mind that our other yet to be met partners will have a lot to say oxy wants to take the lead on the core venture two red sea i agree this is a perfect laboratory to address all of the market structure issues that will make the kingdom a great place to do business mike im sure you can add more rick its up to you if you want to send this around to the saudi team merry christmas,05:28:00,"Yes

my indication here as to how i will rule the bottom line is that socalgas must respond to those interrogatories seeking to clarify which settlement is its first choice it is by no means crystal clear and does impact the breadth of support for each settlement in fact id like to know sdges view on this too i think this could be done in a limited way as opposed to responses to all the interrogatories comparing the two settlements whether socalgas has breached the interim settlement by also signing the comprehensive settlement is not directly relevant to this proceeding i dont need to determine that and i dont want to expand this already farranging proceeding to include that take it to court if you want to moreover some of the questions are now moot as all prepared testimony has been lodged so please meet and confer again if you cant come to an agreement based on my views in this email then socalgas should file its opposition on the two three rd and ill rule on each interrogatory on the

the iso is the lack of public information tim wants all iso information as he says more better faster in other words he wants meter and outage information water levels bids and schedules actual flows transmission availability and congestion making this information available is necessary for three reasons this information would help the market to police itself and provide better price signals producing a more efficient market it would remove competitive advantages held by monopsony load servers and generators owning a large percentage of the generation in the market it would also as sue points out remove the transmission availability knowledge advantage held by the grandfathered transmission contract holders susan j maraees zero nine zero eight two zero zero zero one two zero six pm

steffeshoueesees subject re answering your questions on ca transmission access document link mary hain ok ill take a shot in answering your questions steve others are free to comment as well the transmission issues in the iso are greatly lessened if you talk to the traders they love it before aprilone one nine nine eight they had no sales to ca now they have millions of dollars of sales why no transmission access to speak of before the iso took over we still have some problems however the problems have been there since day one and ferc has punted on them we have a huge ferc case dealing with many of them we also appealed a stupid ferc order on path one five probably at least a year ago and have heard nothing from ferc on it the traders have also seriously considered a ferc complaint on path one five so what are the access issues path one five is the major constraint point between northern and southern ca has been for years the transmission fix is basically adding a third intertie line between tracy and tesla when i left pge in one nine nine six the estimated coast was three zero zero million the congestion costs did not justify building the line then pge continues to control path one five and tells the iso whats left after pge allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes there is no transparency pge has the ability to use path one five to advantage diablo canyon given the existing contracts carl has looked into it somewhat and doesnt think pge is but the iso says it cant interpret pges contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with ferc about how its some kind of overseer we protested and have now appealed the munis have been receiving preferential access since day one their contracts were generally subservient to the iou rights more like interruptible but once the iso started all of a sudden the muni rights became super firm superceding the iou rights as far as we can tell from sketchy filings and discussions with iso staff thats why we have pushed the issue also dynegy and power exchange not the px have rights on path one five tim belden would love to get some info on how that constaint is being operated information in general is pretty sketchy on realtime transmission we have complained to the iso about how the iso knows whats going on in transmission as do the utilities changes what it does which then changes prices and then doesnt tell us until after the fact the iso has promised to do better but i dont think has implemented any real changes yet advantageous access except for whats going on in path one five i dont think the ious have any advantages on access except with respect to regulatory must run resources like nuclear and hydro but i think its resource specific rather than owner specific the munis are another story see next item munis preference this is a huge issue here and i assume across the country in making a devils bargain with the munis the ferc has put the iso into an untenable situation the sanctity of contracts under any and all conditions has created preference for incumbents not the ious but everyone who had a transmission contract with the ious and poor rights for those poor schlepps like us who have come into the new market the iso cannot operate the system this way and is forced to give the munisdynegy more than they had originally and to let them do things no one else can do eg some munis get to change their schedule after the actrive hour begins some get to do it every half hour so far most havent had to pay for ancillary services etc there are many many examples of how we are discriminated against in addition to path one five and of how ferc has shined us on but yet we fight on the most recent muni giveaway is the litigation surrounding the new transmission charge for ca into this has been entangled the rules for munis joining the iso the munis want huge handouts to join and part of the new t rate includes hundreds of millions of subsidies for munis ive pointed out that this amounts to the ious customers paying for the munis stranded transmission costs when they are already paying for the ious stranded generation costs but this argument fell on deaf ears in the iso its really not our issue but it does make you kind of sick about where public policy stands in this state feel free to call four one five seven eight two

one two one mgkg were collected from the east wall of the excavation about two feet outside the nng facility fence and about four feet below ground surface sample three tph two two four zero zero mgkg was collected from the east wall of the excavation about eight feet outside the nng facility fence and about eight one zero feet below ground surface there was little visual evidence that this soil sample was affected but apparently it is in my discussions with texacos consultant i inquired about their sample analysis plan he indicated that they were submitting soil samples for tph analysis by method eight zero one five mod gro dro i was concerned about comparing results from the eight zero one five mod analysis to our older data generated by method four one eight one in light of this i submitted our samples for analysis by method four one eight one the eight zero one five mod method is a more compound specific analysis than the four one eight one method and often the more appropriate method to use however in this case it may not be the most appropriate method the eight zero one five mod method is a gc method used to measure the mass of hydrocarbon compounds that will elute within specific time windows the first time window is set up to measure the mass of gasoline range organics gro the second time window is set up to measure the mass of diesel range organics dro any hydrocarbon compounds that elute after the dro time window are not measured this would not be an issue if the soil was contaminated with a light condensate but texacos oil pit was reportedly used to accumulate liquids not suitable for feed stock to the plant i think we can assume this meant heavy hydrocarbons the four one eight one method is a less sophisticated method that measures petroleum hydrocarbon compounds over a wider range of carbon number that is it will measure the presence of heavier hydrocarbons that would not be measured using method eight zero one five mod in light of this the four one eight one method is likely the more appropriate method for assessing soil affected by the texaco oil pit particularly when results are compared to older data generated using method four one eight one i have requested our lab to confirm the results for sample three using method four one eight one in addition i have asked that they run the sample using method eight zero one five mod gro dro so that we can compare the two results we should have these results later next week i would like to get this additional information and discuss it among ourselves before we respond to texaco right now i am inclined to say that the texaco oil pit is neither implicated or cleared as the culprit of contamination found in nngs monitor well mwthree from george robinson zero two one five two

let me know if you have any strong opinions of issues that you think we should discuss ehud will write a formal letter to skilling inviting him to the conference when we have the opportunity i would like to have a discussion with you about what the people at enron think they understand and do not understand about valuation also do you think it is an advantage that you are doing business with relatively naive financial institutions or a disadvantage im thinking that it might make sense to run a one or two day executive program on valuation which would include participants from energy companies and financial institutions let me know if you think you could get support for this at enron by the way i still need a name and address to send my check back i think shirley can take care of it thanks regards sheridan sheridan i am aware of the duplicate check problem and i owe you phone call about this i am still trying to mobilize internal support for the valuation study we discussed at san antonio mark ruane whom you met moved on to a new job and his successor is a bit skeptical about the need for a study internal enron perception is that we understand the process of decision making inside big financial institutions or lack of it especially in the energy area regarding valuation of investment projects any study would just reveal what we already understand about quite simplistic tools they use dcf with a discount rate being subject to negotiations within a very broad band of potential values it will help if i get the agenda of the conference soon to pass it on to jeff

newswires zero six two five two zero zero one dow jones energy service copyright c two zero zero one dow jones company inc los angeles dow jones federal energy regulators only have the authority to order refunds for about a third of the nine billion california gov gray davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the one two months to may two zero zero one documents from the states wholesale market operator show of the total two nine billion came from the mayseptember period the federal energy regulatory commission has said it cant act on and two eight billion from the octobermay period is attributable to municipal utilities over which ferc lacks jurisdiction according to documents from the california independent system operator that leaves just three three billion in alleged overcharges that ferc could potentially order refunded far less than the nine billion davis seeks talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began monday curtis wagner the ferc administrative law judge presiding over the talks has said california will likely see refunds from generators but far less than the nine billion davis expects davis said sunday california is going to washington dc with one goal and that is to bring back nine billion nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities the iso documents show the iso said the los angeles department of water and power for example overcharged california seven five million between may and october david freeman the governors chief energy adviser and the former general manager of the ladwp said the agency didnt overcharge the state but conceded it profited by selling spare power to the iso davis adviser nancy mcfadden said the state needs ferc to lay the groundwork for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from corporate energy suppliers but during a conference call sunday with reporters mcfadden and davis press secretary steve maviglio couldnt explain how the governor would go about getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices arent regulated by ferc davis testified before the us congress last week that generators overcharged the state nine billion and that ferc should order the refunds state sen jim brulte rrancho cucamonga has asked for an investigation into daviss testimony saying the figures were based on shaky calculations to come up with its conclusions the iso compared hourly market prices received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been expected under competitive market conditions the iso established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive at times about one two five per megawatthour to two zero zero mwh a fraction of actual prices in the market based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with airquality rules the iso however typically used the price of gas at californias northern border according to the documents generators paid a higher price for the fuel in southern california raising the cost of making electricity the iso also used reports of earnings by the states big five power suppliers during two zero zero zero earnings that for some quadrupled to draw the conclusion that generators overcharged the state according to the documents the iso attributed high power prices in part to the states three largest utilities failure to buy the power they needed in advance leaving the grid operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute according to the documents the iso alleges the following

one five mile lateral pipeline facilities that interconnects tw and epng to the recently constructed griffith energy power plant therefore citizens is looking to possibly have a three rd party provide contract operations services under an operating agreement tw has been asked in writing by citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these facilities does tw have an interest in providing contract operations services for citizens in a related legalregulatory question does tw have the authority to conduct contract services on behalf of others or would we have to perform these services as a separate legal entity if we do does this present an affiliate problem for us if we share operating employees if these threshold questions can be accommodated and tw is not only able to provide contract operations services for citizens but has a commercial desire to do so what would we charge citizens for this service although it would appear at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities remember that citizens will be receiving gas potentially from both tw and epng simultaneously presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure between the pipes but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts from both pipes as well as the plant site although im the principal commercial representative for citizens as regards transportation matters im certainly willing to step out of the middle of this negotiation if operations desires to handle it themselves i will be happy to provide you a copy of the brief one two page letter citizens sent to me on the one seven th soliciting tws interest given the relatively short lead time until lgs operations is sold citizens has requested expedited consideration please let me know how you want to proceed

generation capital costs and return appear to be excluded from the bid caps iso will pick of the dayahead and dayof energy markets lot to the demise of calpx thus ending the market separation there appears to be language that intimates direct unit dispatch but the document is very thin on this iso proposes payments based either on the asbid up to unit bid cap or apparently a uniform marketclearing price based on marginal units cap out of state resources are paid california capped rates settlement will be on numbers other than those posted so much for transparency theres looking to procure as based on optimization although this is not spelled out well it appears that selfprovision is gummed up completely to prevent mw laundering ca will required inarea generation to make all capacity available whenever stage one or higher emergency ie reserves below seven this california first rule means the generation must be scheduled against ca loads or bid into dayahead market if you dont bid your bid cap is applied there will be a capacity element similar to rmr this change will require ferc buyin which obviously will be litigationcentral and its likely to create a cascade of

 Communication/Attorney Work Product",im planning to have rob walls sign it he signed the last one the original notice of dispute to president de la rua to start the icsid clock for filing and rob is also on the power of attorney the purpose of this letter is to document all the meetings guido doak and i have had with various government officials and to restate in writing all the requests for relief we have made to the argentine government prior to filing the suit in a recent bit case against the argentine government the icsid panel dismissed the claim because the claimant failed to show that it had made an effort to state the relief it sought to the government prior to filing the case we have certainly made our requests known to just about every argentine official who would listen but as a matter of precaution we want to get this letter on file before filing so there is no doubt pete i think doak is advising azurix on its bit claim as well although i dont know the extent of his involvement but thanks for reminding me about that recall that icsid is the only arbitral system in the world that requires the claimant to fit into various jurisdictional pigeon holes before it will hear the case thus it is important that we communicate with azurix to avoid either company making contravening jurisdictional statements the icsid jurisdictional rules are not specific enough to avoid various interpretations we estimate our jurisdictional battle could last at least a year before we get to the merits but our hope is that we can reach a settlement in the interim ill keep you updated and will meet with you before we file the claim to lay out our strategy and answer any questions regards michelle peter e weidlerenron zero one zero four two zero zero one zero nine zero nine am to michelle blaineenron_developmentenron_development cc eduardo quintanatgstgsenron_development bruce lundstromenron_developmentenron_development richard b sandersectenron_development rob wallsnaenronenronenron_development subject re that is good progress who are we planning to have sign the letter to president de la rua so everyone is aware azurix is also preparing to file for arbitration under the bit not quite sure what over i gave john garrison michelles name to cooridinate with pete michelle blaineenron_development zero one zero three two zero zero one zero seven five nine pm to eduardo quintanatgstgs cc peter e weidlernaenronenron bruce lundstromenron_developmentenron_development richard b sandersect rob wallsnaenronenron subject subject re icsidbit claim happy new year eduardo ive met with doak and guido and they have agreed to the caps we discussed on the projected budget for filing the bit claim against the argentine government only those two law firms will be involved from now on doak and guido also requested the opportunity to review the numbers again at the end of two zero zero one see where we are and adjust the budget as needed on a yearly basis i will be involved in that process as well i dont see this as being a big revision or increase but more of an adjustment depending on the timing and progress of the proceedings in other words we may not get nearly as far in the jurisdictional proceedings as we have projected for two zero zero one so wed adjust the numbers accordingly i believe this is a very reasonable approach and hope that you and perez companc will find it acceptable please let me know if you have any question or concerns that i can answer to expedite this process we are waiting for your return to send that letter to president de la rua because we have made changes and i think your input is crucial we plan to file the request for arbitration two weeks following and we are sending you a draft copy which wed like to discuss with you and cristian before filing i hope that you are having a wonderful holiday and i wish you and your family the best for the new year kindest regards michelle,03:24:00,No
