harris we do not need to set up a new cayman entity to transfer the two certificates for one two five m to we achieve no us tax benefit for transferring or holding the shares in a cayman entity i propose that ebph xii obtain the two certificates and then distribute those certificates to enron south america llc the sole shareholder of ebph xii the value of the certificates at the date of transfer will determine the us tax treatment given the liquidity discount surrounding the stock using the screen price on the date of the transaction is probably not a good indicator of the fair market value for tax purposes we will assume the value to be the historical cost basis since recent trades have been in a narrow band on either side of that value if the first one two five m certificate is sold shortly after the transfer to enron south america llc we will need to adjust the transfer price since the sales price to a third party will be a valid indicator of what the fair market value was on the date of the distribution if the ultimate transfer price is higher than the tax basis ebphxii will recognize taxable income and pay us tax on the gain in the year the distribution was made to enron south america llc this would result in reporting a tax expense in two zero zero zero and perhaps book income in two zero zero one if that sale takes place after the end of the year if the value on the date of the transfer is ultimately determined to be less than the historical tax basis the distribution to enron south america llc will result in there being unrecovered basis in ebph xii if the shares are sold by ebph xii to affiliated cayman companies the same valuation issues exist with the same potential for recognition of us gain on the sale from ebph

risktrac risk analysis and reporting can help but do not have all of the erms information to be able to ensure the completeness of risktrac i have attached the request form for each of these changes at the bottom of this memo please ensure that everyone in your group obtains a copy the procedure to set up a new curve is as follows trader starts trading at a new location or a new commodity and needs a new curve set up trader communicates this to risk management risk management constructs new curve in erms with the help of the it department risk management completes a curve set up request form to set up curve in risktrac curve form is forwarded to risk analysis and reporting risk analysis and reporting sets up curve in risktrac a system generated message is sent to people on the curve list indicating a change in the risktrac curves has been made if the curve is not set up in risktrac the positions are not captured in the var or engine thereby making var inaccurate as a side note risk analysis and reporting has implemented a new process in which on a weekly basis new curves set up in erms are reviewed to ensure that these have been set up in risktrac we did this for the first time today and noted numerous curves in erms that are not in risktrac which we are working with you to resolve the procedure to set up a new book in risktrac is as follows traderrisk management determines new book is needed new book request form for risktrac is completed by risk management new book request form is forwarded to risk analysis and reporting risk analysis and reporting sets up book in risktrac risk analysis and reporting forwards request to erms administrator and global counterparty group to request that book is set up in valuation and counterparty systems once all groups have completed their individual set ups a final email is sent to personnel on the books list and the book administrator in the risk management department who requested the book it is important that there is a one to one link between the erms and risktrac books or not all positions will be captured in risktrac two commodities per erms book does not flow properly into risktrac the above two processes have formally existed for a number of months additionally we are formalizing the procedure for changing portfolio hierarchies the procedure now is risk management is responsible for requesting all portfolio hierarchy changes previously changes could be made through a request by risk analysis and reporting or rac these two groups are no longer allowed to submit change requests all requests must come through risk management risk management completes a request including the reason for the requested change in structure risk management forwards the request to risk analysis and

 -- No Surprises",ngis daily gas price index published june two one two zero zero one marketers ferc datacollection effort in ca a fishing expedition a proposed initiative by ferc to collect an inordinate amount of price and volume information from transporters and sellers of natural gas into the california market is nothing more than a fishing expedition by the agency marketers charge the commission proposed the reporting requirement last month in response to mounting pressure from capitol hill for regulatory action in the volatile gas market the electric power supply association epsa occidental energy marketing inc and tractebel energy marketing inc contend that fercs effort would duplicate ongoing state investigations into gas prices impose an extremely burdensome requirement on pipelines marketers and local distribution companies ldcs for information and force companies to turn over proprietary and confidential data that could expose them to potential financial harm they urged the commission to narrow the scope of its proposed informationcollection effort considerably moreover the marketers questioned whether ferc had the authority under the natural gas act nga to demand data from companies over which it lacked jurisdiction and to investigate natural gas prices but the american public gas association apga which represents municipal gas distributors is fully behind the commissions effort in california natural gas prices have been consistently and substantially higher than the national average the commission has correctly noted that market forces have not alleviated the high natural gas prices in california in a timely or predictable manner this suggests among other things that the fundamental marketplace principle of supply invariably increasing to meet demand is being frustrated the group said rmzero one nine president bush has said the california gas market warranted further review and designated new commissioner pat wood last month to head up the effort the apga noted wood and commissioner nora m brownell will travel to california next week to confer with gov gray davis about the states gas market wood on at least two occasions has acknowledged that something doesnt appear to be quite right with the market and commissioner william massey this week told a senate committee that ferc needed to do a lot more work with the california gas market ferc currently is exploring allegations that el paso natural gas and its merchant power generation affiliates engaged in illegal practices to drive up gas prices at the southern california border during two zero zero zero see daily gpi june one two occidental energy marketing inc which markets gas produced by its affiliates within california doesnt dispute that a price investigation may be warranted its objection primarily is with the manner in which ferc proposes to gather information not only does the commission take a shotgun approach to data gathering it has admitted that it may not have the authority to do anything about the information it receives occidental said moreover while much of the information it may receive under this rule may provide guidance as to what is happening it may not give ferc any clue about why occidental suggested that the commission take a more limited approach and focus on examining issues that are subject to its jurisdiction such as capacityrelease transactions on interstate pipelines that serve the california market not only would such an inquiry clearly be within the purview of the commissions jurisdiction it would also lend itself to a much more focused approach ferc already has proposed reinstituting the rate cap on capacityrelease transportation to the state border see daily gpi may two four the commissions decision to remove the cap as part of order six three seven last year contributed at least in part to the significant runup in gas prices in california last year critics claim the epsa which represents independent energy marketers also recommended that ferc limit its actions in california to those that are within its jurisdiction such as approving new interstate pipeline projects the addition of new pipeline capacity and improvements in the natural gas transmission system will often limit or alleviate existing higher pricessince these factors are under the jurisdiction of the commission a continued examination of these issues would better prepare the commission to respond to any future price volatility also the group proposed that ferc rather than initiate its own informationcollection effort use the data from the california investigations that are already in progress if ferc should decide that it needs to pursue additional data through a reporting requirement it should provide for a more narrowly focused set of data and specify a sunset date for market participants the epsa noted companies are reluctant to turn over such an enormous amount of information to ferc since it has not provided any specific guarantees of confidentiality the epsa said the politically charged california environment heightens the potential for abuse of this information by way of manipulation and misrepresentation tractebel energy objected to a reporting requirement for marketers that are unaffiliated with interstate pipelines as well as other nonjurisdictional companies unaffiliated gas marketers in california move prices closer to competitive levels moreover these marketers serve a positive role in enhancing liquidity and competitiveness through their arbitrage role accordingly there is no basis on policy or analytical grounds to collect data from unaffiliated gas marketers it said if ferc should decide otherwise tractebel energy called for it to establish a volume threshold for reporting under which only large sellers would report the reporting requirements as proposed by ferc in late may would target all sellers of natural gas and interstate pipelines and ldcs that serve the california market ferc is seeking to gauge what percentage of the volumes destined for california is domestically produced gas sold by marketing affiliates of pipelines and ldcs in saleforresale transactions these are the only sales over which ferc has jurisdiction under the nga see daily gpi may two two although ldcs and other sellers are not directly subject to fercs nga authority the commission noted that the law does give it extensive authority to collect information from all parties to determine whether there has been a violation of the nga and to serve as a basis for proposing legislation to congress the commission proposes to collect the data on a quarterly basis three zero days after the end of a quarter in a standardized format it then will aggregate the data submitted and analyze it promptly to determine what action if any is warranted with respect to the california gas prices prices in southern california have been especially volatile in the last couple of weeks falling to below the four mmbtu mark in early june from one five mmbtu at the start of april they have since rebounded to more than seven mmbtu in addition to getting a handle on the level of gas sales by pipe marketing affiliates and ldcs in california ferc is seeking to obtain an accurate picture of the overall average gas costs being incurred by all purchases of natural gas moving into the california market as well as the extent to which the cost of interstate transportationaffects the price for the gas commodity at the california border,13:36:00,"Yes

however he did say that staley will be eased back into the role after the teams bye week so expect correll buckhalter to see the majority of the carries when philly plays the ny giants on october two

chick updated one zero zero eight zero one walls proved to be quarterback chris weinkes best target sunday against the four nine ers catching one zero passes for nine one yards and a score walls wont do this every week but he will get a lot of looks from weinke when he cant find his receivers terrell owens wr sf team chick updated one zero zero eight zero one owens was productive once again on

passes against only one interception aaron brooks qb no grid iron goons updated one zero zero eight zero one brooks turned in his second consecutive mediocre performance sunday he only threw for two

jschaubskaddencom subject re millennium update here is the update one bony is getting a legal opinion on the adr issuance and is in contact with milleniums attorneys two dkb has performed investigations on whether these adrs must be restricted dkbs view is that they should not restricted this is highly arcane us sec law so my summary is probably missing a lot of finer points but my understanding is that dkb views the sale of the local shares as a real sale with a public notice a public underwritten auction etcand there is nothing restricted about the shares i dont think bony would dispute that but i think their interpretation and our legal view is that the shares are restricted because they are shares that were not registered with the sec under the original adr issuance and critically they were sold by the issuer that is bonys view is that bndes is the same as millenium bc they are both government entitiesie bndes is the issuer therefore regardless of the public nature of sale of the shares and the fact that the shares arent restricted for trading locally in brazil the shares issued as adrs would be restricted per us law now ultimately we have to go with what bony says bc they issue the adrs however before we charge back to bony and argue dkbs case i would appreciate a review by skadden back to me on whether these shares if issued as adrs would be restricted we want unrestricted nyse adrs if possible three when the adrs are issued they will be issued to pep a brazil company but deposited in one of the cayco parents of pep custody account we will need to check brazil law and revise our ms custody account accordingly to se eif we can do this sara again i will try to call tomorrow i apologize for the delay four the plan to move the adrs out of brazil is as follows there will be no sale and no cash movement there may be a cpmf pep will perform an inkind capital reduction of the shares back to its cayco parent this will probably require some brazil government approvals or may not if so what are they and how long will they take five critically we have been advised by brazil legal and by us tax that the shares if moved in this manner will move at the original cost basis ie there is no taxbale event for us or brazil lynn please confirm six i dont have a timetable yet i will call bony tomorrow for an update on timing regards bruce

standpoint lynn has determined that if we move the shares via a capital reduction there will be no brazil or us tax other than perhaps a cpmf since we will move the shares at their original basis so the price doesnt matter too muchbut i dont want to take any chances with the brazil tax authorities better to move the shares now when the price is pretty even than to move it later when the price has

our position on kyoto all i would like to discuss how we might respond to this letter from greenpeace if at all the letter is attached way at the bottom of this email and was received in several enron european offices as a copy of what was sent to jeff skilling and other ceos of major companies i have not confirmed our receipt of such a letter from any of you but am assuming it was delivered i think we could respond in a very positive constructive manner to greenpeace based on the statements weve already documented and the strategies we are developing lisa jacobson and i are currently working on developing some tighter climate change and clean air messages that we can use in multiple areas asap upcoming ken lay speeches and interactions with the administration revising the statement for the two zero zero one corporate responsibility report enron business articles and other internal uses responses to environmental group inquiries and shareholder meeting qa and use in everyday speeches and advocacy work the greenpeace questions are tricky and set up nowin answers for the most part i doubt they will get any direct answers to questions like does your company support president bush in his opposition to the protocol in my opinion we can respond to greenpeace without directly responding to these types of questions addressing kyoto directly is a slippery slope its best to stick with the solutionoriented approach weve always taken for this reason i was a bit concerned to see in the email chain below a characterization of mark palmers statement on kyoto given to jackie gentile in london enron has always taken the view that the kyoto protocol was not a workable solution to dealing with cotwo emissions however it is not the principles behind kyoto that we take issue with rather it is the vehicle that has been devised to deliver the results i believe it is dangerous to make such statements for a number of reasons greenpeace would absolutely beat us over the head with it friends of the earth could step up its shareholder initiatives etc also this sets you up for a number of follow up questions that i dont think we have answers to like what about kyoto is not workable what would make it workable and would we help make it workable if not kyoto what is enrons preferred vehicle id really rather stay with a constructive solutionoriented approach and avoid reference to kyoto altogether i will talk with kate bauer in enron europe about this but i think we need to decide on a global corporatewide response to greenpeace i would be happy to set up a quick conference call on the subject or just field comments by email whatever works best thoughts jeffrey keeler director environmental strategies enron washington dc office two zero two four six six nine

other ceos on five april two zero zero one the email chain below gives an indication of what is in circulation greenpeace is expecting a response within the next week jackie gentle has made me the point of contact in the pr department for this issue we have discussed this issue briefly and we would support issuing an initial statement to acknowledge receipt of the letters perhaps followed by a standardised corporate approved letter but would like to ensure our approach is supported and consistent with any actions by corporate as some of the countries in which we operate have tangible green focused projects eg we have acquired a wind project in the netherlands it may be appropriate to allow such countries to personalise their response in local language if we follow up an initial acknowledgement with a fuller response to greenpeaces questions i suggest we consider the following issues raised recently by jackie gentle in response to several requests for clarification i have spoken with mark palmer who has provided the following information on enrons stance regarding kyoto enron has always taken the view that the kyoto protocol was not a workable solution to dealing with cotwo emissions however it is not the principles behind kyoto that we take issue with rather it is the vehicle that has been devised to deliver the results we firmly believe that there is work to be done in reducing greenhouse gases and enron has put in place a number of programs that have measurably reduced carbon dioxide as well as sotwo and oxides of nitrogen nox by way of example emissions trading programs have been put in place where these can be implemented enron is one of the largest developers of natural gasfired power plants which produce about five zero percent less carbon dioxide than coal or oilfired plants demandside management programs through ees to reduce energy usage the catalytica program focus on renewablerelated projects at the current time there is no formal statement from enron corp on the kyoto issue before we proceed i would be grateful if you could contact me to share your views on this many thanks best regards kate kate bauer manager public relations

construction efforts in a one stop shop five at its open meeting this evening the federal energy regulatory commission ferc approved an order addressing market monitoring and mitigation for california wholesale power markets based on the ferc staff presentation and discussion during the meeting it appears that the market monitoring and mitigation plan for california includes the following one a requirement that all generators which entered into a participating generator agreement with the iso and all nonpublic utilities in california that sell into the isos realtime market or use the iso transmission grid must offer all available electric capacity during all hours to the iso realtime market except for hydroelectric units two all public utility load serving entities in california must submit demand bids in realtime markets during all hours three all sales by market participants that have been granted authority by the ferc to sell power at marketbased rates are subject to a refund condition to prevent anticompetitive bids into real time markets four the iso is required to submit weekly reports to the ferc on scheduled outages and bid data to facilitate market monitoring five all sales into the iso realtime market during a period of reserve deficiency ie during stage one two or three emergencies will be subject to price mitigation the ferc order will include a formula that the iso will be required to apply for purposes of calculating a proxy price for all such sales the order will also enhance the isos ability to coordinate and control planned outages the mitigation plan will be in effect for a oneyear period and will be subject to periodic review the ferc is also requiring the iso and the investorowned utilities to submit a filing by june one two zero zero one to form a regional transmission organization rto if an rto filing is not submitted by that date then the market monitoring and mitigation plan will terminate automatically the ferc is also directing the parties to work with rto west an rto approved for the pacific northwest to develop a plan for including california within rto west with a goal of ultimately creating one rto for the entire western interconnection finally the ferc is instituting an investigation under section two zero six of the federal power act with respect to wholesale power sales throughout the western interconnection apparently potential refund liability would apply to wholesale power sale transactions in the western interconnection entered into for a period of two four hours or less and made when reserve deficiencies are seven five or less ferc also approved the formation of rto west an eightstate rto combining the transmission assets of nine utilities in the pacific northwest the ferc asked the rto

product line north american gas url httpwwwceracomcfmtrackeprofilecfmufive one six six mone two two one the us gas market enters the month of june with prices at the highest level since deregulation at the henry hub prices have surged to between four three zero and four four zero per million british thermal units mmbtuup from less than three zero zero per mmbtu in april behind this has been a building and serious shortfall of supply the result of disappointing gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation the gap between these two forces has been met through storage inventories with injections so far this spring running between one five and two zero billion cubic feet bcf per day below last years pace the weak injection rate so far this season reinforces the pressurelast weeks injections of only eight zero bcf per day compare with last mays injections of over one zero zero bcf per day if this trend were to continue throughout the summer gas inventory levels would not meet minimum acceptable levels for next winters heating season which cera believes to be between two six five and two seven trillion cubic feet tcf of working gas in storage by october three one indeed injections for june to october must ramp up to an average of eight one bcf per day zero four bcf per day higher than last years rate for inventories to approach two seven tcf a level that still exposes the market to shortage late next winter even reaching this level will be a challenge and will require that demand be priced out of the market this growing realization has sent the market into a panic although the forces that have pushed the gas market to this level are not a surpriseindeed they have been building for over a yearthe resulting price level is shocking nonetheless it highlights the challenge of pushing prices high enough to choke off demand and to free gas supplies for storage unlike years past the gas market pressures this year come at a time when there is little flexibility in energy markets overall indeed power markets are headed into the peak summer months with generation capacity still largely constrained in most markets this is likely to result in a higher incremental call on gas than ever beforewith only limited ability to switch to alternative fuels at the same time oil prices remain above three zero per barrel making the cost of switching particularly high all these forces combine to suggest that the current market pressure is far from an aberrationand it raises the question where will it stop there are breaking points in the market that are currently being testedmany of them involving industrial and feedstock uses of gas few of these currently cost below four zero zero per mmbtu and many are currently above five zero zero per mmbtu how high prices go and how long they stay there depends very much on the strength of the underlying market pressures we expect to see the following reactions power generation incremental gastoresidual fuel oil switching the atlantic coast dualfuel market is already providing the first demand response to higher prices given the late may climb in gas prices relative to residual fuel oil prices a significant portion of the one five bcf per day dualfuel market has switched from burning gas earlier in the month to burning residual fuel oil this summer cera expects virtually all logistically and environmentally feasible dualcoal load to burn residual fuel oil this will result in an incremental six zero zero million cubic feet mmcf per day loss of gas demand from these plants relative to last summer and relative to early may however to keep that load burning residual fuel oil gas prices will have to sustain premiums of zero zero five to zero two five per mmbtu above one residual fuel oil prices at new york harbor to price out switchable capacity in the northeast premiums to gulf coast residual fuel oil will be required to price out florida and mis sissippialabama switchable capacity despite this fuel switching activity cera expects overall gas demand for power generation to climb by three zero bcf per day from may into june as overall power demand increases reductions in ammonia production cera expects a loss in gas demand for ammonia production even with the recent strength in ammonia pricing ammonia prices have softened somewhat from their highest levels of a few weeks ago but were still at one six five per short ton over the past week at these price levels us ammonia margins began to disappear as gas moved above four zero zero per mmbtu at the henry hub given the strong gas prices cera expects a sustained period of negative ammonia margins last summer when ammonia margins disappeared a sizeable portion of the north american ammonia production capacity closed at its most extreme in august gas demand for ammonia was down by zero four bcf per day this demand reduction is likely to be repeated for much of this summer the closing of ammonia capacity should lend some support to ammonia prices last summer in response to ammonia closures ammonia prices climbed by about one five per short ton this feedback effect would keep a tight balance on price for example raising the ammonia price to one eight zero per short ton allows the industry on average to maintain a margin until the henry hub price reaches four five zero per mmbtu there are limits of course ultimately high gas prices will not shutter the entire domestic ammonia industry which uses approximately one six bcf per day in fuel and feedstock ethane rejection in previous gas price spikes or periods of low oil prices processors have elected to leave ethane in the gas stream providing an incremental source of gas supply the observed difference in ethane production levels in recent years demonstrates a flexibility to add approximately six zero zero mmcf per day of gas supply should extracting ethane from the gas stream become clearly unprofitable strength in oil and products markets this year however makes such an addition to gas supply highly unlikely last week may two two two six mont belvieu ethane priced above five five zero per mmbtu over zero three six per gallon with propane pricing over zero five four per gallon given these products prices gas prices of five zero zero in the gulf coast and four two five in the rockies would be required before processors leave significant quantities of ethane in the gas stream in addition propane the major alternate to ethane in the petrochemical sector is currently in short supply the result is that until world oil markets loosen allowing imports of propane ethane is likely to follow gas upward should gas even reach the ethane price unless gas prices rise significantly from current levels or until oil markets themselves weaken cera does not expect ethane rejection to add much to gas supply this summer methanol methanol margins are also suffering with current gas prices even given recent healthy methanol prices methanol prices are being supported by the return of asian demand specific plant outages including several ammonia feeder plants in trinidad and the late startup of several worldscale methanol plants including plants in trinidad saudi arabia and iran although recent spot methanol prices have risen well above zero six zero per gallon contract prices in the zero five zero range would imply production shutdowns when gas prices are above four zero zero per mmbtu a significant portion of methanol plants having already shut down last summer only a small incremental amount of gas demand is expected to be lost with further shutdowns in methanol production perhaps zero one bcf per day fuel switching to distillate with distillate prices well above five zero zero per mmbtu distillate is not expected to provide a major source of demand relief unless the pressure intensifies extensively and prices spike further for next winter however fuel switching to distillate could become an important force taking the pressure off gas marketsparticularly on the east coast that said distillate inventories are currently low to the extent this continues through the end of the year it would set up a repeat of what occurred last winter in the northeast when prices in both distillate and gas markets spiked in total there is certainly the potential to provide well in excess of two zero bcf per day of cushion through a combination of reduced consumption and some localized ethane rejection in the rockies and eastern gulfplus a marginal increase in liquefied natural gas lng imports up to zero one mmcf per day but currently such a reduction in consumption would require an even greater increase in prices for now the gas market appears to have reached a very tenuous resistance point in the four two five four five zero per mmbtu rangea level that should result in choking off an incremental zero eight to one one bcf per day of gas demand relative to two weeks ago from the combination of additional fuel switching to residual fuel oil and reduced feedstock demand for gas see table one however as we move through june and into july even slightly warmerthannormal temperatures could add an additional one zero bcf per day of highly inelastic demand for power generation relative to normal weather and force prices ev en higher to balance the market cera estimates that it would take prices in the five zero zero to five two five per mmbtu range to rationalize this extra demandprincipally through a combination of ethane rejection and additional reductions in feedstock demand for gas this deep a reduction inevitably would force price reactions in petrochemical marketspushing gas prices up even further there are also limited forces that could drive the market lowerand remove some of the panic mild temperatures through june would provide the most significant impact by allowing more breathing room for storage injections any movement by opec to increase crude oil output could also help lower the fuel switching threshold points but even if both these forces were to act we estimate this would move gas prices back down only into the three five zero to four zero zero per mmbtu range if prices fell any lower demand would surge from a return of feedstock demand and fuel switching back to gas for these reasons cera has raised its henry hub price outlook for the third quarter of two zero zero zero to four one eight per mmbtu and the average for the year to three six seven per mmbtu end follow url for pdf version of

 Consolidation & Related Matters",kay i agree with your comments on the selection of the alj the following is our response to your two questions ryan and i believe that we can set forth a number of differences between the two cases such as the site specific air quality impact analysis required under the applicable regulations the differences in parties to the proceedings the different impacts to the various petitioning local governments depending upon their distance from the facility in question the different phases of discovery that the cases are presently in and the like nevertheless the foregoing may not be sufficient grounds to preclude the consolidation based upon a minimal delay in the proceedings as we understand that dep is proposing more importantly we previously expressed our concern with the companys current position in the deerfield proceeding relative to the proposed nox limitation of three six ppm because dep has not been persuaded to date to increase the permit limitation to four two ppm and because enron did not legally oppose such a condition in the deerfield permit then enrons ability to raise such an objection at this point appears to be impaired there may be an argument that enron noted its objection within the permit comment period which terminated after the deadline for filing any legal objection and therefore enron noted its objection on the record and no one is prejudiced by asserting its objection within the pending proceeding at this stage since discovery has only just been initiated in light of these circumstances we could advise dep that enrons position is that it does not object to the consolidation as long as the trial date is in january two zero zero two and as long as the parties recognize that enron will challenge the proposed nox limitation of three six ppm under backup fuel use conditions with respect to both permits in a consolidated proceeding please advise me of your thoughts kerri original message from mann

january otherwise we might choose judge stampelos based upon the prior comments that we have received from our tallahassee attorneys although both judges were considered to be good four martha indicated previously that she is looking for a hearing in january depending upon which alj hears the case and his particular schedule five martha advised me that she will file her request for consolidation late tomorrow afternoon i told her as we discussed in our conference call that if she does not hear from me to the contrary then we oppose the consolidation at this time six martha agreed to provide us with the permit language that dep is proposing in connection with its notice of change of agency position on the pompano beach proceeding as soon as al linero completes the drafting and she reviews the proposed permit conditions with him martha expects to provide us with the proposed permit language next monday or tuesday seven the petitioning local governments have served dep with discovery i have yet to receive a copy of the discovery but martha intends to meet with al linero this friday to discuss deps response based upon the foregoing please advise me if you want me to convey any further message to martha prior to her filing of the motion for consolidation tomorrow afternoon specifically i am interested in your thoughts on our preference on the judge that will hear the proceeding if consolidated and whether we have any objection to deps filing the motion for consolidation in which she will note our objection as we discussed in our conference call we can assert our position more fully in a subsequent response to the motion for consolidation and can withdraw our objection if we change our mind thanks kerri

government approvals the review by regulators is expected to take months as for unpleasant financial surprises enron has already produced a devastating stream of them over the past month ranging from huge writeoffs of assets and reductions of shareholder equity to major downward restatements of past earnings reports much of this turmoil has been caused by enrons dealings with private partnerships run by its own officers indeed recent enron disclosures indicate that as much as half of the companys pretax earnings in recent years came from deals with these officerrelated partnerships raising further questions about the quality of enrons earnings and the potential for hundreds of millions of dollars of additional writeoffs or restatements enrons partnership dealings have sparked more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits and a formal investigation by the us securities and exchange commission in a measure of the continuing concerns over enrons financial condition both moodys investors service and standard poors once again downgraded enrons debt on friday this time to just one level above noninvestment grade or junk status they also kept the company under review for possible additional downgrades and sp put dynegy on the same status a downgrade to junk status could force enron to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars in cash or stock to buttress some of its complicated financial transactions in an interview friday dynegy chairman chuck watson said his company made a good assessment of enrons condition and that in the worstcase we can come up with we feel comfortable that the value exceeds the liabilities mr watson said dynegy has given itself the opportunity to back out of the proposed merger under certain conditions which he declined to specify a person familiar with the deal said that dynegy has a right to walk away if enrons additional legal and financial liabilities exceed three five billion a dynegy spokesman confirmed the figure the price

politically divisive foreign direct investment remain uncertain following enrons absorption by dynegy and legal moves by indian creditors challenging a possible sale although dynegy has not publicly

meet on november one nine the day it was expected to announce a final notice that it was quitting the plant but on friday indian creditors won a temporary injunction in a bombay court restraining dpc until december three foreign and indian creditors and dpc have been trying to broker a compromise for months after a fallout between dpc and its sole local customer maharashtra state electricity board the latest attempt concluded on saturday in singapore just as a parallel drama over enrons fate reached a climax in houston what started as a financial restructuring exercise to salvage the indian project rapidly turned into a fire sale a decade ago dpc was given fasttrack clearance and was advertised as a symbol of indias economic awakening its withdrawal is now seen as an indictment of the attempts to jumpstart economic growth critics portrayed dpc as arrogant and the company endured unremitting domestic hostility mseb said dpcs tariffs were excessive environmentalists argued dpc benefited from a political process lacking transparency leftwing politicians insisted dpcs huge capacity was unnecessary dpcs patience snapped in april when it issued an initial termination notice since then it has been mired in a multitude of legal offensives in singapore indian lenders which carry an exposure of one four bn in loans and guarantees to dpc about seven zero per of the total debt

utilities were the sole serious bidders the dark horse was the governmentowned national thermal power corporation which has working links with ge and bechtel the disaffected constructors and minority shareholders in dpc by indian corporate standards the low bids are still dizzily ambitious but both utilities enjoy powerful allies with deep pockets bses for instance is two nine per cent owned by

in power telecommunications and broadband that could be hampered if their dpc bids succeed yet they would have much work to do at dpc which analysts say is unsustainable in its present form first the

with three seven zero zero zero miles of pipe enron widened its lead over the years so that last year it reported one zero one bn in revenue to dynegys two nine bn it was the numberone seller of natural gas and power in north america and operated the biggest webbased transaction system in the world but on friday the dynegy chief executive brought his company out from enrons shadow agreeing to buy its embattled rival in a deal worth about nine bn in stock overnight dynegy became the biggest energy trader in the us how did he do it where enron emphasised individuality dynegy stressed teamwork where enron encouraged entrepreneurship dynegy stressed customer satisfaction where enron urged aggression to pervade everything from its trading floors to its financial accountings dynegy made friendliness and conservatism its culture enron had its name emblazoned across houstons professional baseball stadium and was building an office tower in downtown houston dynegy was renting two eight floors out of the wells fargo complex enron mr watson notes had a reputation for doing business with a swagger if thats your modus operandi when things dont go well people come after you mr watson says he believes that image of cockiness made questions over enrons balance sheet spiral out of control the balance sheet adjustment itself could not justify the massive degradation of its equity in a matter of weeks the masses at enron are thirsting for a change in image mr watson says he intends to give them that mr watson will remain in charge when dynegy takes control of enron in the coming months he has asked mr lay to join the board but mr lay has not made a decision its been a good ride for the most part mr lay said friday night but added i would say the last three weeks have not been a lot of fun mr watson reached out to mr lay on october two four as the crisis of confidence in enron became increasingly untenable the securities and exchange commission was investigating its finances investors were dumping its stock and the credit rating agencies were downgrading its debt mr watsons mother was having heart surgery and he was with her in saint louis but he called mr lay to offer to help in the back of his mind was the possibility of buying enrons valuable pipeline assets to provide it with liquidity to support its fast diminishing business two days later mr watson went over to mr lays home to begin working towards a combination in a meeting with mr lay and the rest of enrons management team it became clear they were willing to fix the problem whatever it took mr watson believes the deal was put together so quickly because dynegy works with enron on a daily basis they know each others people and businesses and they are both based in houston were one of the few people maybe the only ones who could have pulled it off he says now that he has done so mr watson plans to move into enrons new buildings but has not decided whether to rename the stadium to reflect its new owner his teenager wants him too but that would seem to go against the modesty that enabled dynegy to win in the end c copyright financial times group httpwwwftcom copyright

dynegy last week shows agencies are often more than dispassionate observers in enrons case its credit ratings were crucial to its survival the company needed an investment grade credit rating to retain the confidence of its energy trading counterparties enrons solution was to arrange an acquisition by dynegy but first it received the credit agencies blessing with the two companies close to a deal on friday morning moodys responded to investor concerns about the company by downgrading the companys ratings to just one notch above junk however it also signalled it was prepared to sanction a

new york times company call it a nine billion shotgun wedding dynegy inc an energy marketer and trader based in houston took the biggest gamble in its corporate history on friday by agreeing to buy the enron corporation its much larger crosstown rival for more than nine billion in stock in one decisive move chuck watson the chairman of dynegy positioned his company to become the most important player in the volatile but potentially lucrative business of trading natural gas and electricity but the hastily arranged deal carries big risks for dynegy as well skeptical investors and wall street analysts say no one outside enron appears to understand the companys tangled finances fully and the speed with which the deal was made did not give dynegy time to scrutinize in great detail enrons trading book or the web of partnerships enron has entered to move debt off its balance sheet and hide losses the skeptics wonder why dynegy decided to take on enrons huge debt which some analysts say could total two three billion in loans on and off its balance sheet instead of simply trying to hire away enrons best traders some of whom were already leaving the company there are many risks associated with this merger that we will not know about for a while said carol coale an analyst at prudential securities were not sure that we know everything there is to know at enron yet in addition enrons earnings could be far lower than it has reported said james chanos a shortseller who has been a vocal critic on thursday enron said in a filing with the securities and exchange commission that it had used partnerships to overstate its earnings by a total of six zero zero million over the last five years mr chanos said other information in the filing indicated that more restatements were possible with so much uncertainty surrounding enrons finances mr chanos and other analysts question dynegys decision to move so quickly they note that dynegy and enron often traded with each other and some analysts had wondered whether if enron had filed for bankruptcy those trades might be wiped out leaving dynegy unhedged or unprotected against sudden movements in the prices of natural gas or electricity if on the other hand enron is not forced to restate its profits down further then dynegy has clinched an amazing bargain analysts say enron will make one eight zero a share this year so dynegy is paying just six times enrons annual earnings about a fourth the average ratio of companies in the standard poors five zero zero dynegy said on friday that the deal should increase its pershare earnings next year by nine zero to nine five cents to three four zero to three five zero even without factoring in up to a halfbillion dollars in annual savings before taxes from the merger dynegys shares closed friday at three eight seven six up two two six so if the companys forecast is accurate it is trading at one one times its two zero zero two earnings still a bargain compared with the average stock in the s p five zero zero jeff dietert an analyst with simmons company in houston said dynegys estimates for its earnings in two zero zero two were conservative and very achievable mr watson said friday that dynegy was confident that enrons operations and its trading business were healthy we feel this is a very solid company with plenty of capacity to withstand whatever happens the next few months he said mr dietert said dynegy needed to strike a deal with enron quickly to make sure that enrons trading operations and financial health did not deteriorate any further if enron preserves the value of the marketing and trading company then there is clearly value in the enron stock he said preserving enrons investmentgrade credit rating is crucial to keeping the trading operation afloat to help convince moodys investors service and standard poors the major rating agencies that enrons rating should remain investmentgrade dynegy has agreed to inject one five billion into enron immediately still on friday both agencies cut enrons rating to just one notch above noninvestment grade or junk status and both suggested that the rating could fall further so investors and creditors will watch carefully this week to see whether other energy companies continue trading with enron and whether the merger stems the outflow of talented enron traders another question hanging over the deal is how easy it will be for dynegy to walk away if enrons finances turn out to be worse that enron has already disclosed the merger agreement according to executives and investment bankers who shaped it gives dynegy the opportunity to quit the deal without penalty if major new problems surface but what exactly those terms are remains unknown so far investors are giving dynegy the benefit of the doubt the companys stock rose one seven percent on thursday and friday the market believes chuck watson and the dynegy management team are very disciplined in the way they manage

street journal one one one two two zero zero one the wall street journal cone copyright c two zero zero one dow jones company inc what could arthur andersen have done to protect the investing public from enron brushing up on a basic accounting textbook might have helped some critics say confirming investors fears the houston energy trader thursday filed a lengthy disclosure document with the securities and exchange commission declaring that its financial statements going back to one nine nine seven should not be relied upon and will have to be restated among other problems enron acknowledged overstating its net income by a total of five eight six million or two zero enrons financial statements long have been widely assailed as indecipherable now it turns out they were just plain wrong but what is most striking about the latest disclosures is that they show enrons misstatements werent limited merely to judgment calls and gray areas for the greeneyeshade crowd to debate portions of enrons accounting practices amounted to violations of elementary accounting principles some accounting specialists say citing clientconfidentiality rules an andersen spokesman david tabolt declines to comment on his firms work for enron which on friday agreed to be bought by crosstown rival dynegy he calls enrons disavowal of its previous financial statements an unfortunate situation and says andersen is cooperating with the secs enron investigation and the special committee formed by enron to investigate the companys accounting and disclosure practices consider the primary reason for the one two billion reduction in shareholder equity that enron revealed in midoctober sparking much of the downdraft in the companys shares at the time enron said the reduction came about because it had decided to unwind certain transactions with some limited partnerships with which it had done business on thursday however enron acknowledged that the original accounting for the transactions violated generally accepted accounting principles starting in early two zero zero zero the company said last week enron issued shares of its own common stock to four specialpurpose entities in exchange for which it received a note receivable enron said it had increased both its notereceivable assets and shareholder equity a move the company called an accounting error that it is correcting under gaap the payment a company receives when issuing stock only counts as equity if it is cash as a result enrons two zero zero zero audited financial statements overstated the companys notesreceivable assets and shareholder equity by one seven two million and enrons two zero zero one unaudited statements overstated them by eight two eight million the one billion overstatement represents eight five of enrons previously reported shareholder equity as of june three zero it is basic accounting that you dont record equity until you get cash and a note doesnt count as cash says lynn turner a former chief accountant for the sec the question that raises is how did both partners and the manager on this audit miss this simple accounting one zero one rule adds douglas carmichael an accounting professor at baruch college in new york anyone thats an accountant looking at the entry should have known it violated gaap an enron spokesman vance meyer says the accounting error was just that an error explaining that we believed it was not material however it was of course corrected and we did make the correction with andersens concurrence he says andersen performed limited quarterly reviews of the companys unaudited financial statements and reviewed the entries that resulted in the shareholderequity overstatements to the extent they deemed necessary to some who follow the accounting world closely this has a familiar ring to it during the past few years every big five auditor has been hit by multiple accounting debacles at highprofile clients for andersen enron joins a list including waste management inc and sunbeam corp while the names of the clients may change the issues remain largely the same for instance enron had reported net income of one zero five million for one nine nine seven a figure that enron last week said will be reduced to nine million in its upcoming restatement for that year enron said the reduction is mostly because of five one million in various unexplained audit adjustments and reclassifications that its auditors had proposed in one nine nine seven but at the time had determined to be immaterial cumulatively those immaterial adjustments added up to nearly half of enrons net income for one nine nine seven and now will be included in the companys restatements that looks a lot like what happened at sunbeam according to the secs may settlement order with sunbeam andersen auditors had routinely dismissed so many violations of gaap as immaterial that they eventually piled up to produce significant distortions in sunbeams financial statements making the barely solvent consumerproducts maker look handsomely profitable sunbeam filed for chapter one one bankruptcycourt protection this past february in may the sec filed a civil lawsuit against five former sunbeam executives and the andersen partner in charge of the companys audit accusing them of engaging in a massive financial fraud all six defendants have denied the secs allegations andersen itself wasnt named as a defendant and has said it believes the lawsuit against its partner was an unjustified action over questions of professional judgment under gaap misstatements arent immaterial simply because they fall beneath a numerical threshold according to an sec accounting bulletin under certain circumstances and it remains to be seen if they apply in the enron case the sec says intentional immaterial misstatements are unlawful one reason is that when immaterial misstatements are combined with other misstatements they can render the financial statements taken as a whole to be materially misleading enron which paid andersen two five million last year in audit fees and two seven million for other services is one of andersens biggest clients so far mr tabolt the andersen spokesman says the sec hasnt told andersen it is a subject of the enron probe enrons disavowal of its previous financial statements also is a major embarrassment for the directors who sit on the enron boards audit committee which serves as the overseer of enrons financial reporting internal controls and compliance processes among the committee members is wendy gramm a former chairman of the commodity futures trading commission and the wife of us sen phil gramm r texas ms gramm also was a member of the audit committee of ibp inc a

while enrons reputation is still in question said mark roberts director of research at off wall street an analysis firm in cambridge mass it looks like a good deal for dynegy but if they can buy enron for one zero four zero a share it makes you wonder about enrons recent eight k filing which made things look pretty good if it were so good they wouldnt be selling for one zero four zero a share roberts said regulators seen approving merger federal regulators will probably approve the deal because they want to make sure the energy markets are safe roberts said a lot of people are exposed here and this is an arranged marriage to save the market this deal has to get done because enron is in trouble and there are too many parties at risk before the merger was announced us natural gas and electricity traders had begun cutting back business with enron accepting lower bids or higher offers from competitors rather than take on the credit risk of trading with the struggling market leader that should change with the announcement of the merger analysts said traders were backing off of enron because there were questions about how long it would survive without an equity injection barone said its in everyones best interest that the merger be completed as fast as possible to maintain liquidity and stability in the market barone added that while the merger would create a super global powerhouse he didnt think competitors should be worried i think theyll be fine they wanted this successfully resolved because if enron were illiquid they would have had problems the market would have had problems he said a mirant corp mir spokesman said that while the market is bigger than just enron was the merger is a positive step dynegys involvement is good for the market there will be a lot of opportunity in the market going forward said spokesman chuck griffin reliant spokesman richard wheatley said the merger will create a more competitive market player dynegy is a formidable company and the merger will create a marketplace with an even more formidable competitor wheatley said consumer advocates oppose merger consumer advocates said the merger raised issues of market dominance the

stories of the past week have been the opposition to the planned merger of hewlettpackard co hwp and compaq computer corp cpq and the continuing troubles of enron corp ene who wouldve thought theyd turn out to have a connection at least a tenuous one kenneth lay enrons chairman and chief executive is a member of compaqs board and less than two weeks ago he sold a big chunk of his stake in compaq for a price that appears to be significantly less than what he couldve gotten had he simply waited for the hp deal to be completed according to a securities and exchange commission filing released friday lay sold one two four five nine six compaq shares more than a quarter of his compaq stake on oct two nine for nine two five a share the filing doesnt give a reason for the sale but notes that as a compaq director lay is restricted by the company to trading in its stock only during limited specified periods heres the funny thing though given the exchange ratio in the hpcompaq merger as well as hps stock price at the time compaq shareholders stood to get about one one worth of hp stock for each compaq share at the time lay sold his shares so lay sold at nine two five a share at a time when his stock was essentially worth one one a share if the deal is completed he reaped about one one five million in proceeds from the sale but thats about two two zero zero zero zero less than the shares were worth at the time under the merger with hp boy thats a vote of confidence in the merger isnt it leaving two two zero zero zero zero on the table its also worth noting that lay could find the time to attend to his personal finances even as his own company was facing mounting questions about its financial structure and transactions the latest development that threw the hpcompaq merger into serious jeopardy the announcement that hps founding hewlett family which holds five of the companys stock intends to oppose the deal didnt occur till more than a week after lays sale and theres no indication that lay knew anything about it at the time he sold his shares but thats irrelevant if youre a compaq director and youre confident that the hp merger is going to go through and provide you with a premium why would you sell at all ever surely lay isnt hurting for money according to enrons proxy statement he earned a salary of one three million and a bonus of seven million in two zero zero zero plus seven five million in enron restricted stock and other benefits including use of a personal plane there may be a good reason for lays sale but if there is enron isnt providing it an enron spokeswoman declined to comment on lays sale of compaq stock a compaq spokesman couldnt be reached granted this is very much a sideshow both to the hpcompaq deal and enrons own quagmire in which the company wiped out five eight six million worth of earnings thursday by admitting that some offbalancesheet entities should have been on enrons balance sheet after all but given the shellshock that hp compaq and enron shareholders have been through this week they deserve more of an explanation about this from lay than a quiet afterthefact sec filing by michael rapoport dow jones newswires two

financial dealings now they are admitting that they did not really understand what was going on enron has been very secretive when it comes to revealing its financial arrangements clearly the company seems to have se up all these private partnerships to make its balance sheet look clean and nice in return it allowed its senior employees to profit and fatten their wallets through the fees paid for the transactions was it the price paid to keep quiet sp and moodys have lowered the companys credit rating its stock price has fallen from a high of about eight five rs four zero eight zero a year ago to about one three rs six two four now and newspapers are speculating that the company may be bought over the securities and exchange commission of the us has begun investigating the company but enron and its chairman mr kenneth lay are major contributors to president bush and his republican party so dont hold your breath the immediate question that arises is that enrons board must have been aware of these conflicts of interest where employees were benefiting in private deals they were making with and on behalf of the company this is especially glaring in the case of mr fastow who made the decision on both sides of the fence that is as cfo of enron and as the managing partner of the partnership he was running why was the board sitting quiet about the corruption at this level a look at the boards composition provides some interesting information apart from several luminaries in the energy and petroleum fields three individuals should draw attention one is mr norman blake a former

different among others the settlement requires microsoft to disclose technical data to help competitors make programs pc manufacturers will have more freedom to ship machines with non microsoft products and the company cannot retaliate against them and it will have to establish standard royalties and licensing terms more interestingly a threemember panel will be located at microsoft headquarters with staff and access to company records to monitor compliance with the settlement the period is initially for five years and is extendable to two more while microsoft may not secure high marks for the quality of its products the company has always been a leader with its strategy though technologysavvy users of personal computers have always praised apple for its hardware and its operating system microsoft is the one that has climbed to dominate with nine zero per cent market share and this is because it quickly worked with allies to establish its operating system as the more widely used standard with comparable astuteness the company managed to drag the antitrust case long enough till a more sympathetic president occupied the white house the antitrust head under the democratic president clinton was joel klein who was seen as a hawk doggedly pursuing the company so microsoft waited it out while making significant monetary contributions to the republican party even

involves an investor selling securities they do not own in order to profit from a fall in prices the short selling of bonds that are about to be repaid is unheard of unless there is a fear that the

firm served as enrons outside auditor for more than a decade assuring investors the companys financial statements conformed with generally accepted accounting principles last week the company reported that it overstated earnings by five eight six million over four andahalf years inflated shareholder equity by one two billion because of an accounting error and failed to consolidate results of three

appropriateness of that decision settled suits the sec and shareholders can sue an accounting company for issuing false and misleading financial reports about a publicly traded company andersen this year paid one three zero million to settle lawsuits alleging the firm allowed waste management inc and sunbeam corp to file false financial reports that cost investors billions of dollars in losses lynn turner who was the secs chief accountant for three years until he resigned in august said enron and andersen ignored a basic accounting rule when they overstated shareholders equity explaining the equity reduction last week enron said it had given common stock to companies created by enrons former chief financial officer in exchange for notes receivable and then improperly increased shareholder equity on its balance sheet by the value of the notes basic accounting what we teach in college is that you dont record equity until you get cash for it and a note is not cash said turner who is now director of the center for quality financial reporting at colorado state university its a mystery how both the company would violate and the auditors would miss such a basic accounting rule when the number is one billion dollars enron paid andersen five two million last year two five million for auditing and two seven million for services including business and tax consulting due diligence procedures and help in preparing sec filings according the companys proxy statement enron and andersen declined to provide further detail those fees were proportionately larger than some

seven million enron paid andersen for nonaudit work if you had an auditor that wasnt trying to crosssell other services with more profit potential would it have been as acquiescent coffee asked andersens tabolt defended the firms consulting work for enron we help improve the quality of financial reporting by helping clients understand the accounting rules and how to apply them said tabolt in doing this we follow the rules of the profession and the sec in the waste management and sunbeam cases shareholders and the sec alleged that andersen allowed the companies to inflate earnings and revenue the firm agreed last week to pay two zero million to settle a malpractice lawsuit over its audit work for waste management last june andersen agreed to pay a seven million civil fine the largest ever imposed by the sec against a big five accounting firm black eyes in april andersen agreed to pay one one zero million to settle a securities fraud class action suit filed over its accounting work for appliance maker sunbeam corp the appliance maker filed for bankruptcy protection in february andersen now has three black eyes in a row said coffee who addressed the national institute on class actions of the american bar association on friday in san francisco the groups members are lawyers who have collected billions of dollars for investors in securities fraud class action suits against public companies theres a beauty contest going on said coffee referring to meetings taking place at the conference he said law firms are courting some of enrons institutional investors for the right to represent them against the energy company and its auditor andersens tabolt said the sec hasnt notified the firm that it is under investigation in connection with its work for enron coffee expressed concern that sec chairman harvey pitt who took over the agency in august may not be as aggressive in pursuing accounting fraud as his predecessor arthur levitt as a private lawyer pitt represented major accounting firms anyone who violates the law and i do mean anyone will be held to the same high standards the agency has applied for nearly seven decades said pitt in an

assumed debt in an interview after the merger announcement watson and enron chairman kenneth lay discussed how the houstonbased companies reached agreement less than three weeks after enrons shares began plunging all the financial noise about the partnerships maybe it has damaged the enron brand a bit watson said but ill tell you what it hasnt impacted and thats the high regard that the industry places on enrons trading business he said enron last week restated earnings for four years to include losses from three affiliated partnerships reducing earnings by five eight six million six employees out of enrons two zero zero zero zero may have improperly benefited from the partnerships lay said im sorry those six people seem to have gone somewhat over the edge in their dealings or transactions but you cant be absolutely protected from that in any business he said lost effectiveness lay didnt specify which six people he was referring to he removed andrew fastow who helped set up and ran many of the affiliated partnerships as chief financial officer on oct two four an enron securities filing says fastow made more than three zero million off two of the partnerships fastow had lost his effectiveness because of all the press coverage on the affiliates lay said treasurer ben glisan and kristina mordaunt a managing director and a corporate counsel for an enron division also were fired enron said in a corporate filing on thursday former employees michael kopper kathy lynn and anne yeager were in a position to profit from partnerships the filing said you trust people you accept their representations and proposals lay said sometimes when you do that you get surprised and disappointed both executives said they expect antitrust regulators to approve the merger because the two companies own different types of assets and wont dominate any market there really isnt anything that lays on top of each other watson said friday night were not in the pipeline business and they are were in the generation business and theyre really not dynegy shares rose six two percent on friday after terms of the enron purchase leaked to the press watson expects the acquisition to add

the purchase chevrontexaco corp which owns two six percent of dynegy agreed to provide enron with two five billion what we found when looked under the hood is that the core of enron was still there and working as well as ever watson said that business was pristine and had nothing to do with the partnerships dynegy began taking steps toward the acquisition in late october when watson called lay to offer assistance with enrons growing financial crisis the two men said that led to a saturday morning meeting in lays kitchen he even made me a breakfast roll watson said he didnt eat it lay said lay said he wont be an active manager in the new company watson said friday that he and lay hadnt discussed a severance package as head of enron lay had refocused the houston operator of us naturalgas pipelines on trading and international expansion boosting reported revenue two zero fold since one nine nine five to one zero zero eight billion last year he said he doesnt regret the strategy clearly enron has gotten involved in business that hasnt turned out well lay said pointing to moneylosers azurix inc created to supply water and build related projects around the world and newpower holdings inc a seller of electricity to homes and small businesses but you have to keep in mind too that one two years ago we werent in the wholesale merchant trading business today thats an incredibly valuable franchise the trading business which accounts for about nine seven percent of enrons revenue buys electricity gas and other commodities from producers and sells them to end users such as utilities and industrial customers it also advises big business customers on energy use and sells them gas and electricity reassessing steel lumber watson said the new company will keep trading coal gas power and petroleum products and plans to expand by buying assets and using them to develop trading well just have to reassess over time whether we stay in trading of steel lumber and other nonenergy commodities he said enron wants to shed its six five percent stake in dabhol power co in india which is owed six four million in overdue bills from a state government agency that has refused to pay the power prices enron was promised in contracts we have strong legal remedies and were heading down the path toward arbitration but wed still very much like to work out a settlement with the government lay said potential buyers have balked at enrons one billion asking price for dabhol neither man would comment on whether dynegy plans to cut jobs after the merger or what will happen to the naming rights to enron field the major league baseball stadium is home to the houston astros and enron paid one zero zero million to have its name on the ballpark the name of the company is now dynegy

be interested said mr dietert who added that the energy giant would be well served by resolving the protracted dispute the stock is going to be much better off after the issue is settled he said mr

state electricity board mseb from its gasbased plant on the states west coast but mseb stopped buying power in may calling it expensive and defaulted on payments jeopardising the projects future we have made it pretty clear to the government leadership we are now at a point where we would like to be taken out and we think most of our partners do lay said in the financial times interview besides enron the other shareholders in dpc are us group general electric and bechtel which own one zero percent each and mseb with one five percent earlier this month lay had a meeting with indias finance minister yashwant sinha to try and resolve the issue but talks ended without any solution we have fought this once before put it back together fixed the contracts but we dont want to do that again and

will be difficult for international investors to view india favourably until it enron issue is resolved and in a reasonable manner she told a meeting in new delhi copyright two zero zero zero dow jones company inc all rights reserved weekend dam buster arundhati roy achieved worldwide success as a booker prizewinning novelist but she has given up the glory trail to become indias most prominent activist campaigning against nuclear tests and the dams that threaten the homes and li madeleine bunting zero seven two eight two zero zero one the guardian copyright c two zero zero one the guardian source world reporter tm arundhati roy burst on to the indian national stage from nowhere in one nine nine seven a dropout architecture student and onetime aerobics instructor she had turned her hand to writing a novel it was the god of small things and it earned her one of indias biggest ever advances before going on to win the booker prize and sell six million copies the rebellious outsider southern and female had trumped the coterie of men who dominate indias literary world and the reward was an insatiable international fascination she found herself cast in the role of indian national mascot adored and feted for her global success four years later there have been no more novels and the now three nine yearold darling of indias middle class has become a painful thorn in its side writing a series of savage critiques of indias development its nuclear tests its huge damconstruction projects and its cringing obeisance to western corporate power these are home truths that powerful interests in india do not want to hear and roy has made herself many enemies irritated by her criticisms and the publicity they invariably attract in the west the indian establishment has set about trying to cut this awkward rebel down to size this week roy faces a contempt of court charge before the indian supreme court her first appearance in the drawnout case was four months ago her alleged crime is to have attended a demonstration against the courts decision last autumn to give the goahead to the countrys most controversial dam project the sardar sarovar in the narmada valley central india roy is accused of inciting violence and attacking a court official ludicrous though many aspects of the case appear to be the lawyers roy consulted advised her to plead guilty and apologise when she refused none would risk his career to represent her undeterred she wrote her own affidavit and defiantly had it published in a masscirculation magazine on the day of her first court appearance much to the fury of the court which has threatened further proceedings roy risks a sixmonth jail sentence how did the writer of an intensely lyrical novel become a committed activist with an analytical prose worthy of a barrister what induced her to swap her status as delhis mostfavoured dinner party guest for night marches and sitins at the dam sites and even possibly jail why did the whimsical chronicler of small things the beetles and creeping lush greenery of kerala turn to fighting big things such as nuclear bombs dams the indian state and globalisation roy comes down four flights of stairs to open the door to her apartment block here where she writes and spends most of her day she has none of the small army of servants considered necessary by middleclass delhi her flat is surrounded by the contradictions of indian development which she analyses in her essays a comfortable suburb of new delhi where cows rummage in the rubbish piled up in the open gutters and where a man has set up shop in the shade of a tree ironing the neighbourhoods washing probably earning in a day just enough to buy one cafe latte in the new empty air conditioned coffee shop we sit in a crepuscular gloom the fierce delhi summer requiring that all the blinds be drawn and the airconditioning is on in roys small apartment of strong primary colours books a big television and computer she talks in a low gentle voice its a sharp contrast to the vehemence and coruscating wit of her writing i like the fact that my rage goes into bigger things not into small petty things with people around me she says i am surrounded by people i love and what i crave is gentleness friends come and go and the telephone rings frequently we get off to a bad start because roy hates the writeractivist label with which she is saddled it reminds her of sofabed she writes what she sees she says and she sees no great distinction between fiction and nonfiction all she does is keep her aching eyes open she refers me to an address on writing that she gave earlier this year in the us in the midst of putative peace a writer can like i did be unfortunate enough to stumble on a silent war the trouble is that once you see it you cant unsee it and once youve seen it keeping quiet saying nothing becomes as political an act as speaking out she stumbled on a silent war in one nine nine eight after a giddy year of international celebrity which she admits she enjoyed immensely all those hotel towels she enthuses in one essay but she knew in the end that the good manners and hygiene would kill her what anchored her as she spun around the globe was home and she resisted the temptations of emigration im not the sort of person who can buy a life she came to see fame much like a tin can trailing noisily behind her wherever she went eventually it would drop off and she would then write some worstsellers and eat mangoes in the moonlight but the prospect of such leisure vanished as she returned home to look at her country with new eyes india was jubilant at its first nuclear test and roy penned the end of imagination a furious attack on this symbol of national pride the title was misplaced however because what then captured her imagination and has done ever since was that the biggest mass nonviolent movement since indian independence the campaign against the narmada valley dams was then on the brink of victory she set aside the novels she had been planning to read and threw herself into the detail of technical subjects such as irrigation and drainage since then her voracious curiosity has ranged from export credit guarantees to electricity distribution rates and resettlement programmes for those displaced by the dams roy has spent much time reflecting on the direction her life has taken she describes with a romanticism akin to tolstoys how the marches she attends in the narmada valley have given her a pride in her people and her land and also a philosophy the struggle has rooted her intellectually and emotionally after the upheaval of celebrity it also helped assuage the guilt over her sudden wealth which she once described as making her feel she had perforated the huge pipeline that circulates the worlds wealth and it is spewing money at me bruising me with its speed and strength i began to feel as though every emotion every little strand of feeling in the god of small things had been traded in for a silver coin her interest in the dam is less personal she says like any writer she wants to understand and tell stories and dams sum up like nothing else the story of modern india its greed its wanton violence and its centralisation of power surprisingly in all these reflections roy steadfastly omits any reference to the deep emotional attachment to the rivers of her kerala childhood which is so evident in the novel in one vivid passage she describes the humiliation of the river after a saltwater barrage has been built a thin ribbon of thick water that lapped wearily at the mud banks on either side sequinned with the occasional silver slant of a dead fish it was choked with a succulent weed whose furred brown roots waved like thin tentacles under water once it had had the power to evoke fear to change lives but now its teeth were drawn its spirit spent it was just a slow sludging green ribbon lawn that ferried fetid garbage to the sea almost every page of the god of small things reverberates with the fragile vulnerability of the small children for starters and an intense awareness of millions of tiny living things and the preciousness of small quotidian events this reflects a fierce protectiveness towards the small and the powerless that predates her literary fame her student thesis she says was on the housing of the marginalised urban poor bombs and dams are the corollary of indias slums the bombs have diverted the taxes and the dams have deprived millions of their lands and their rivers despite the legal cases and the veiled threats and savage attacks in the media even by erstwhile allies roy is standing her ground her political writings have evolved from passionate polemic into something more dangerous a considered and witty analysis of globalisation and its impact on india she asks questions that are particularly awkward for the nationalist middle classes who are prospering on neoliberalism is globalisation a process of barbaric dispossession which has few parallels in history is it a mutant variety of colonialism remotecontrolled and digitallyoperated roy has a wonderful sense of her own pace she will not be hurried or hurry herself but she is slowly putting together what she calls a politics of opposition she already senses her place on the intellectual map of antiglobalisation shes been reading noam chomsky john berger and tomes on the history of the third world she is keen to meet the mexican zapatista hero subcommandante marcos and she wants to attend the next meeting of the world trade organisation but she is aware that this is not just a matter of acquiring the right intellectual baggage her politics flow seamlessly from her public life into her private her analysis of power is not just applied to indian democracy but also to how she relates to her family and friends and how she deals with her celebrity and wealth roys political essays powerful though they are have not so far achieved their objectives the end of imagination in one nine nine eight won her many admirers in the west but in india it failed to dent the extraordinary consensus behind the nuclear bomb the greater common good in one nine nine nine on indias preoccupation with dambuilding in the five zero years since independence pointed out that the dams had woefully failed to meet targets for either power generation or irrigation while at the same time displacing at least three three million people roy argued that the bulk of those displaced were untouchables or tribal peoples and that this amounted to a form of genocide the essay won her more admirers in the west and lent weight to the international campaigns against dams the worldwide publicity that roy has attracted by campaigning against the dams has succeeded in scaring off several western contractors of the huge narmada project it involves building three two zero zero dams including three zero major ones but despite all her eloquence and despite the mass protest movement the supreme court ruled last october that work on the huge sardar sarovar dam could resume it was a bitter setback to a movement that had believed it was on the brink of victory after a series of stunning successes including the withdrawal from the project of the world bank the defeat means that now as roy faces her court hearing in delhi hundreds of miles away in narmada the arrival of the monsoon season has set the waters rising again behind the dam over the next few weeks police will have to drag people from their homes to prevent suicide protests by drowning while the judges are discussing our contempt of court case people will stand chestdeep in water for days forget the narmada where hundreds of thousands of cases of compensation for lost land are pending in the courts a threejudge bench will spend days discussing my case but losing their dignity is much more important to the judges the sardar sarovar dam alone will displace four zero zero zero zero zero people and the state worst affected madya pradesh has officially declared that it has no land on which to resettle the people whose whole way of life for thousands of years has been bound up with the narmada one of the great rivers of india what has embittered the battle is that most of the thousands of poor farmers and fishermen displaced in the past decade have yet to be resettled in reality many of those who lose their lands or livelihoods are likely to receive nothing more than paltry financial compensation they end up either as cheap agricultural labour or swell the shanty towns both options are close to destitution meanwhile promises that the dams will help irrigate dry regions of gujarat ring hollow not least because none of the necessary canals has been budgeted for in reality the dams will provide electricity and water for the prospering urban industrial interests of the state which is why the supreme court judgment was greeted with jubilation in gujarats cities the dam presents a stark conflict between the interests of urban and rural between industrial and subsistence economies and it crystallises roys own questions about progress that the poorest are crushed in the pursuit of development i can imagine in the five zero s what a fantastic feat of engineering a dam appeared to be but now when what we know about nature is little enough how can you continue to think this is a wonderful thing to do to intervene in such a massive way in such a complex process its like putting a jackboot into a spiders web what kind of civilisation is it when you teach men in college to look at a river and imagine pouring concrete into it she demands the one hope of forestalling the next big narmada dam scheduled the maheshwar is that it will fail to find the necessary financing within india now that the project has become too controversial for any western contractor emboldened by this success in her two most recent essays roy has broadened the scope of her attacks to include the western corporations involved in the privatisation of indian state electricity companies in particular the us company enron enron was accused of smoothing the path of its massive contract to build a power plant near bombay with dollars two zero m to educate politicians and bureaucrats now the electricity enron produces is more expensive than any of its competitors yet maharastra state is locked into contractual payments of dollars two two zero m a year such business arrangements between these huge multinationals in the west and the third world elite says roy promote a consensus that their model of globalisation liberalisation and privatisation represents progress its a form of fundamentalism to believe that this is the only measure of progress how much electricity is consumed how much more rice is produced whether it is eaten or goes to waste in warehouses even the tools the economists have developed to measure progress are flawed she says adding i think of globalisation like a light which shines brighter and brighter on a few people and the rest are in darkness wiped out they simply cant be seen the lobotomy in the west is that you stop seeing something and then slowly its not possible to see it it never existed and there is no possibility of an alternative but the alternative still exists in india she believes the country is too old and clever to be lobotomised into believing in the one single idea that life is profit defying the tyranny of this idea is a constant thread running through roys politics and her private life it lies behind plans to set up with friends an indianbased corporate watch to monitor corporate power it informs how she is mapping out a politics that demands accountability whatever the regime the only way to keep power on a tight leash is to oppose it never to seek to own it or have it she says opposition is permanent but these big political ideas also have deeply personal implications she adds personal politics and what you do from day to day is just as important as globalisation and opposition to power has to be matched by a reluctance to use power in your own relationships you oppose by the way you live as much as by what you say and do and that is painful and joyful joy features prominently in her description of the politics of opposition against all the odds you defy your critics simply by having too much fun thats why they couldnt forgive her and her mother when she was growing up in kerala she remembers they simply werent as unhappy as a single mother and her thin black clever daughter should have been the whole point of the feminist fight was that there has to be fun at the end of the tunnel you dont want this image of beaten oppressed moaning women you think about things engage with the world and youre aware of the terrible suffering that is happening around you and the way to be with all of that is to enjoy the process of what you are doing and to speak joy in the saddest places if youre living in a world that is telling you that only if you have hamburgers buy diamonds and have a rollsroyce can you be happy then youre saying in the happiest possible way that that is completely wrong she adds its a game of survival and if you allow yourself to become unhappy you will lose everything i remember what my mother said to me ive never known anyone who guards their happiness so fiercely i think its important to patrol the borders of your happiness to understand your sources of joy and to protect them and to know that so often its only when that happiness has gone that you know what it was but you can be cooking or listening to music and think i dont need anything else to happen or anyone else to be any other way in order to be happy happiness for her she says might be going to the market and choosing glass beads after weeks of late nights drafting an affidavit or just lying on the floor all day with friends under a ceiling fan in the delhi summer even gossiping with friends about relationships as the police move in to break up a demonstration at a dam site these are what roy describes as the small delights of her life a source of the strength that has seen her through the turbulence of her meteoric rise to global fame and now the anxiety of the court cases she describes her friends as extraordinary people for dealing with her sudden fame and money and managing to maintain the democratic nature of our friendships none of them had money before now she gives hers away and i know that it is as sophisticated an act to receive as to give it she has probably made enough from the one novel to live on for the rest of her life she eschewed more refusing to sell the film rights arguing democratically that six million readers had their own version of the film in their heads and she didnt want a single filmmaker to replace them all the fame has been burdensome although she claims somewhat implausibly since she had her hair cut a symbol of rare defiance in a culture that fetishises long hair that she has some anonymity in india when asked if she is arundhati roy she says her standard reply is that she wishes she were the causes in need of her celebrity are endless and she turns down most of the requests that come in from all over the world would she open a lung hospital in kerala attend a conference on water in the hague give a speech on being a writer at amherst model for cartier make a bbc television documentary roy smiles mischievously one woman phoned me and said oh darling that essay on the narmada was absolutely wonderful i wonder if you could do one for me on child abuse and i said for or against the most important thing she says is to keep in mind your own insignificance she cant speak about every issue and do them all justice she adds thoughtfully sometimes its hard because fate has conspired to make my voice heard so you have the illusion or other people have that you can do a lot roy is wary of the fickleness of fame and likens it to a wind blowing through a house and all the shutters banging there were moments when i was so unhappy that i wished i hadnt written the book and i hadnt won the booker the huge public fairytale had another equal opposite version in my private life a terrible dark side she refuses to expand preferring to answer questions with general reflections on the nature of relationships between men and women which perhaps supports rumours in delhi that her marriage has broken down in any case the upheaval in her life has now been resolved she lambasts the pact of mediocrity to which the vast majority of people subscribe in their marriages and confesses herself bewildered as to why so many women have children she has none herself by her marriage to a filmmaker one zero years her senior and has no plans to have any until recently i was never secure financially or sure enough about my life to think of having children im so scared of the vulnerability of children i suppose in some deep way i have not been able to cope with my own childhood i wouldnt know how to protect the childs magic now i want to live my life backwards i want to be free to change my mind to think my thoughts and not to be responsible for moulding somebody and for teaching them what is right living backwards means that roy is now looking forward to living out her teenage years and growing old becoming a fit old witch a form of liberation that means being irresponsible keeping everybody she loves feeling loved thats not a matter of luck but hard work she maintains and depending on no one for anything dependence is a form of selfishness she insists roy admits there is a great struggle between political engagement the demos the preparations for the court cases and her desire to concentrate on her writing her enthusiasm for the latter is undiminished i think writing is such a beautiful thing to play with all the time having your hands in that stuff i use it to live my life in the most public and the most private way and i love all different kinds of writing a novel an affidavit a letter writing leads me through my life and i trust my writing so much more than anything else about myself in the immediate aftermath of the booker prize she said she would never write another novel she objected to the way people treated her like a factory now she says she will know instinctively when it is time to write and will be ruthless about applying herself to it it is roys passion for writing that stiffened her resolve not to take the lawyers advice and apologise to the supreme court and she describes a poignantly revealing dream she had before the last hearing i had been sentenced to prison but that was not the fear the only way i could live out the sentence and be released was to learn not to form an opinion about anything there was a sort of big playground with a dazzling dance performance and i was unable to watch it because i was struggling not to have an opinion about it she is more afraid of not being able to speak her mind than she is of prison but she is also well aware that is a ghastly choice one that she would much prefer not to be facing for now she feels a judges hammer hangs over her every word its never what it appears to be its much more a slow grinding down of a writer in one way of a lawyer or an activist in another its not about whether you go to jail but how you have to adjust yourself to survive and thats the issue the fatigue the complete fatigue in the end this is the indian states version of the countrys tradition of nonviolence she adds with wry resignation but she also well knows that the same establishment can be vicious and violent it is dark when we finish talking and the apartment block is silent she offers me a lift back to my guesthouse and as we leave the back alley is deserted and roy seems all of a sudden terrifyingly vulnerable she is nonchalant however we get hopelessly lost in a suburb of new delhi going around in circles while she entertains me with anecdotes of being a judge at the cannes film festival last year i ask if she sees herself becoming a standardbearer in the antiglobalisation movement only if i can say something simple something complicated and something magical she says her eyes gleaming with mischief the only dream worth having i told my friend is to dream that youll live while youre alive and die only when youre dead which means exactly what arched eyebrows a little annoyed i tried to explain but i didnt do a very good job of it sometimes i need to write to think so i wrote it down for her on a paper napkin this is what i wrote to love to be loved to never forget your own insignificance to never get used to the unspeakable violence and vulgar disparity of life around you to seek joy in the saddest places to pursue beauty to its lair to never simplify what is complicated or complicate what is

hesitation is profit iowa utilities have fought wind power and other alternative energy sources for years he said they cant control the wind like they can control energy generated by a coal plant or a

consultants to file required economic disclosure statements a review of those documents which included stock holdings showed that some of the consultants may have crossed the line said the governors senior advisor nancy mcfadden state law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence the governor has not required some of his most influential privatesector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings among them are two wall street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governors energy rescue plan which includes the largest state bond sale in us history the new york firms that employ

associates fall into a separate category of advisor beyond the reach of the states political reform laws critics question the distinction the governors approach may be convenient for him said jim knox executive director of the watchdog group california common cause but it ignores the law disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest knox said trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing the firings disclosed friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than five zero consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year more than two five million is being spent by the state on consultants according to state records in the process seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws it took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances including investments the state political reform act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within three zero days of starting work for state agencies even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted most of the

enron barretto said he never considered his enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice july one eight that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job that notice came from goode the governors lawyer we expect and have always expected the states consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards he wrote that standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today if he or she refuses the state will sever its contract with that person however the governors office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors fichera and hoffman davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney raquelle de la rocha a former member of the los angeles ethics commission and the state fair political practices commission she concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors not consultants and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects fichera is davis point man on the governors energy rescue planincluding the unprecedented bond sale he has pitched the plan to lawmakers reporters and the wall street financial community fichera refused to comment on the record fichera and hoffmans companies saber partners and blackstone group prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure intended to pay for past and future power buying pact specifies financial advice the states contract with the fichera and hoffman firms calls for them to provide financial advisory services to the state the decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with montague derose and associates that consulting firm was hired on a one eight million contract like the other two firms it too was hired to provide financial advisory services to the state that firms top advisor douglas s montague was required by the administration

conflict charges such a wall would prohibit anyone with inside information from discussing it with employees responsible for financial transactions montali refused and pointed to the large sums at stake in dealings on the volatile energy market this can create enormous incentives to misuse confidential information to make large profits or avoid large losses and ethical walls can crumble under such pressure the judge said thursday if the companies quit the creditors committee as they have suggested many others without potential conflicts are available to step in he said the proposal by the

enron wants india to buy dabhol still eyeing options updatefour two zero zero one zero seven two eight zero one four nine new york enron wants india to buy dabhol still eyeing options updatefour adds new enron comment in sixth eighth one four th and one six th paragraphs houston july two seven bloomberg enron corp the worlds top energy trader wants the indian government to buy out its six five percent stake in the dabhol power co project although its still looking at other options a spokesman said enron has invested eight seven five million in the three billion project spokesman john ambler said adding any sale would have to insure enron would completely recover its capital and other costs enron and the maharashtra state electricity board dabhols sole customer are in a sevenmonth dispute over six four million in unpaid bills enron does believe that selling its interest either to the government of india or to the projects lenders is the best way to resolve this protracted dispute ambler said he added the company would continue to pursue all its options under its powerpurchase agreement with the board including international arbitration and would try to protect the interests of dabhols lenders sponsors fuel suppliers and lng ship owners the board which is owned by the state of maharashtra stopped buying dabhols power in may saying its too expensive the move came days after dabhol announced it was beginning a six month notice period to end its contract with maharashtra dabhol halted production after the board stopped buying power were still pursuing other remedies in case the buyout doesnt come through on acceptable terms ambler said while we remain open to discussing other solutions we have serious concerns about becoming embroiled in a perpetual series of renegotiations partners the financial times reported earlier today that enron is interested in selling the stake quoting enron chairman ken lay who was in india earlier this month lay told the newspaper that partners general electric capital a unit of general electric co and closely held bechtel group might also want to exit the project ge capital spokesman ken koprowski said the company would give serious consideration to credible offers which would enable us to realize our financial objectives for this investment in general terms he said ge has a longterm commitment to doing business in india bechtel would certainly consider an offer which would enable us to obtain our financial objectives for this investment spokesman alexander winslow said indian prime minister atal bihari vajpayee was quoted in the business standard last week saying he wants to resolve the dabhol dispute before he visits the us in september the dabhol issue is clearly having an adverse effect on the potential of other foreign investors in india and we believe that pursuing a buyout option could help resolve the dispute in a timely manner protecting indias investment climate as well as the interest of stakeholders in the dabhol power company ambler said he added that indias failure to reform the power sector has made it extremely difficult for outside generators to operate madhav godbole the chief negotiator on the indian side of the payment dispute said earlier today eight indian states would be interested in buying power from dabhol but not at anywhere close to the rates the utility charged under the maharashtra contract dabhol rejected the proposal as unrealistic ambler said there has been no real progress in producing creditworthy buyers in india that can purchase power at a price thats reasonable for a new power plant shares of houstonbased enron fell seven four cents to four six one zero,01:16:00,No

decision on merger imposing capacity release trustee mandate that we proposed to the eu initial vpp proposal by edf original message from sankey ross sent zero one june two zero zero one zero nine five one to de gaulle pierre cc gaillard bruno philip davieslonectenron brun raphael brod simon styles peter dindarova nailia shaw eric elliott mark subject re edf capacity auctions all i would suggest we need to do the following register for the auction and receipt of the im asap bruno could you please discuss with mark and put together our registration document i assume that ectrl meets the criteria of a trader registered in an eu member state does not appear to be any need to deal with credit support or other regulatory qualifiers such as balancing agreements as yet mark agree bruno could you please take care of sending this registration letter agree with pierre who should act as principal contact establish once and for all the role of trustee and cre in the process of approving capacity release phasing auction process for each phase and product specifications and understand how the consultation process will work once we have the im hence need to discuss with mtf then trustee and cre asap ie in june if possible preferably before we meet again with pwcroth in addition to pierres comments the pim also states that strike prices at least are subject to trustee review but a number of areas need to be questioned capacity release phasing pim confirms the five year period of the remdey but also says a review can be requested after three years bruno you need to review the remedy doc but i do not see how a two year phasing of capacity release complies with the remedy at least in spirit we would suggest there is no impediment to offering the full remedy in a single phase if theere is insufficient demand they can always have a fall back position to release unsold capacity on a six monthly or annual basis through the five year period the current proposal is no more than edf trying to minimise capacity release andor extract max value cant blame them for trying but it is not what we want or what remedy requires edfs only real argument is that phasing will allow more new suppliers to enter at a later date as eligiblity threshold drops in france however since eligible demand already exceeds total capacity release this would limit development of competition to existing eligibles as a minimum the release programme for all capacity should be clearly defined up front not at the whim of edf peter thoughts on this and how in context of remedy we can argue for accelerated single phase auction with possible reauctioning of unsold capacity over five years auction process qualifying criteria likely to be more defined in im but no obvious problems here i am less sure about nature of auction process we obviously need to think it through more but why not just have a simple process based on single sealed bids or an electronic bid process the use of price clock controlled by the auctioneer may allow a reserve price to be set which is clearly not the intent of the remedy this should be set at zero for all product groups not subjectively to ensure excess demand but only for certain groups product specs need to understand what if anything can be changed here strikes seem to be subject to trustee approval but we need to understand what else can be influenced eg within day flex since we have already covered this in previous submissions to mtf edf etc this should be easy to identify as we go forward any comments ross original message from de

capacity auctions other eu news point one five this info is of a preliminary nature and is subject to change in addition it is mentioned in point six that registered companies for the auction will have the opportunity to ask questions and raise issues during conferences which will be then considered by edf specifications of the auction will be finalised by end august this seems to leave some room for a complete feedback from registered companies lets discuss the content of the pim i suggest to arrange anothe meeting with pwcrothschild in the next few weeks week one one one six june what

surprise should make your follow up with the mtf interesting as to the role of the trustee one point to note for both mtf and albers at comp the lack of within day flexibility is hardly in keeping with the intention of supporting development of retail supply to end users with fluctuating demand suppliers will thus be at the mercy of edf in the balancing market in addition how on earth can they be allowed to take two years to complete the process how does that fit with merger remedy somewhat ironic that they have the document in english lets discuss what if anyhting we can do after you have

smaller producers under longterm contracts with such contracts electricity suppliers and traders will be able to have electricity without the technical and operational risks of running a power plant said edf in a statement the price for cogeneration capacity will be made public a few weeks before the auction as it depends on gas price movements edf said the auction will take place in several tranches the first one starting in september when two zero zero mw of peak capacity will be auctioned eight zero zero mw of baseload and one nine zero mw of cogeneration the whole six zero zero zero

escapee definition a fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing poop in a stall this is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panicembarrassment this is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding if you release an escapee do not acknowledge it pretend it did not happen if you are standing next to the farter at the urinal pretend that you did not hearit no one likes an escapee it is uncomfortable for all involved making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy jailbreak used in conjunction with escapee definition when forcing poop several farts slip out at a machine guns pace this is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover if this should happen do not panic remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred courtesy flush definition the act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location this reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom this can help you avoid being caught doing the walk of shame walk of shame definition walking from the stall to the sink to the door after you have just stunkup the bathroom this can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you as with all farts it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist can be avoided with the use of a courtesy flush out of the closet pooper definition a colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it you will often see an out of the closet pooper enter the bathroom with newspaper or magazine under their arm always look around the office for the out of the closet pooper before entering the bathroom the pooping friends network pfn definition a group of coworkers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident this group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of out of the closet poopers and identify safe havens safe haven definition a seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex this will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom turd burglar definition a pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force the door open this is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work if this occurs remain in the stall until the turd burglar leaves this way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact camocough definition a phony cough which alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall this can be used to coverup a watermelon or to alert potential turd burglars very effective when used in conjunction with an astaire astaire definition a subtle toetap that is used to alert potential turd burglars that you are occupying a stall this will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied if you hear an astaire leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace watermelon definition a turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water this is also an embarrassing incident if you feel a watermelon coming on create a diversion see camocough havana omelet definition a load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water often accompanied by an escapee try using a camocough with an astaire uncle ted definition a bathroom user who seems to linger around forever could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot an uncle ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper as you should always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is emptythis benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees fly by definition the act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping walk in check for other poopers if there are others in the bathroom leave and come back again be careful not to become a frequent flyer people may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom crack whore definition a crapper that has seen more ass than a greyhound bus tell tale signs of a crack whore include hairs stains and streaks avoid crack whores at all cost try finding out when the janitor cleans each particular bathroom dont forget with a good cleaninga crack whore can become a safe

manitoba aug one six reuters canadians sometimes divided by regional differences economic disparities or linguistic snits find themselves united this summer by an uncomfortable phenomenon a national drought from atlantic to pacific from the arctic to the us border most of the worlds secondlargest country has been sweating through weeks of blistering heat that experts say could end up being the worst drought in decades in many ways this drought is the same tune thats being played right across the country its a different look different season and different impact but nevertheless everybody has a water shortage problem in many parts of the country said david phillips a senior climatologist with environment canada whether its fires raging in the forests of british columbia and quebec barren prairie plains or harsh restrictions on water usage in ontario many will remember the summer of two zero zero one itll be memorable for the wrong reasons i think too much excess and not enough normal said phillips in parts of british columbia water management officials say the tinderbox conditions are largely the result of last winters record low snowfall in the mountains weve had normal summer in terms of rain but we knew back in march with the low snowpack that if we had a normal summer we were going to be in trouble said jim mattison water management director for bcs bureau of sustainable resources but the devastation is most apparent in canadas breadbasket the prairies many farmers especially in southern alberta and saskatchewan have already written off their crops ive been here since six three i have never in my life ever seen anything like this norman stienwand a farmer in castor alberta told reuters its beyond your imagination theres no water the grasshoppers are so bad its beyond your imagination said stienwand who farms one zero eight zero hectares two seven zero zero acres of grains and oilseeds and also raises beef cattle it has been so sweltering in his region located about one six zero km one zero zero miles west of the saskatchewan border that some of stienwands farm machinery caught fire this week as he tried to bale a meager barley crop into hay for his livestock its just going to destroy a lot of farmers theyre just not going to come out of it he said in june the alberta government declared a drought disaster to trigger emergency aid to livestock farmers struggling to feed and water their herds and as many of the withered and patchy crops are harvested many analysts are already anticipating sharp reductions in yields and quality last week the canadian wheat board the marketer of western canadas wheat durum and barley crops forecast a one zero to one five percent decline in exports in ontario canadas most populous province prime agricultural areas have received only about one five percent of the precipitation they would normally see you wouldnt be able to fill a sardine can with the rain theyve got since the twentysecond of june said phillips the drought has created ideal conditions for billions of asian aphids to infest ontarios soybean crop i drive by and actually now i just shut my eyes and pretend i dont see it its just really really really dry said debbie yuck a farmer who lives near ottawa and who has watched her corn whither and yellow over the past few weeks when they come on the radio every morning and say its a beautiful sunny day great to be at the cottage i think a beautiful day would a good downpour for about one six hours said yuck canadas largest city toronto has experienced a record number of days with health alerts because of the heat and smog with temperatures soaring as high as three seven c nine nine f some ontario residents now face fines for watering their yards an ontario woman was recently charged for dropping incendiary material near a forest after she threw her lit cigarette butt on a road in front of a police officer the year with too much summer i wish i could come up with a word that would describe the misery and the hardship that urban and rural folk are feeling said phillips a senior climatologist with environment canada who tracks national weather patters i would describe it maybe as the year with too much summer the hot dry spell could be a blow to the national economy by the time the final bill is tallied for lost crops aiding farmers battling forest fires and generating more electricity it could run into the billions quebecs multibilliondollar agricultural sector which accounts for some one six percent of the canadian industrys revenues and produces three eight percent of the countrys milk has also been hard hit since early july in southern quebec where it has not rained for five weeks despite bouts of high heat and humidity vegetable farmers have been working around the clock to save sunravaged crops the farmers are on the edge of burnout they can barely stand up said david stcyr a spokesman for quebecs powerful agricultural union the atlantic provinces have also been caught in the oppressive heat the result of massive high pressure systems in the united states that for weeks have blocked the circulation of other weather patterns trying to make their way north clouds of red dust follow behind potato producers working the parched fields on prince edward island growers who may lose two five percent of their crop blueberries in nova scotia and new brunswick have shriveled to look like raisins i think there are a majority of canadians probably who can hardly wait for the winter and i never thought id ever hear that said

authorizing southern lng to reactivate the lng terminal at elba island with this withdrawal the el paso organization has drawn its line in the sand we plan to vigorously protest this withdrawal at the

zero our filing will be of an adversarial nature so the enron organization needs to be on board with our intended filing which we will commence drafting on november two zero two zero zero zero drafts will be circulated to the appropriate personnel so please advise us re any additions in that regard at the same time this decision by southern lng will focus our resolve to complete the commercial transaction with el paso merchant energy we have come to accept some of the less desirable features of the letter agreementterm sheet signed with el paso merchant energy on october one three one nine nine nine inasmuch as the more important aspects are very much in our favor including several that southern lng found rather unsettling we will discuss the path forward with el paso merchant energy on november two one two two two zero zero zero while we remain open to a solution to the quality issue that leaves our commercial flexibility and optionality intact we must be positioned to move forward resolutely and in a timely manner with both el paso merchant energy and southern lng we cannot afford to stop these processes while we discuss alternative solutions on wednesday november one five two zero zero zero we gave both mike varagona and david jenkins of el paso merchant energy a headsup regarding our likely response to southern lngs proposed letter agreement dated november one two zero zero zero we indicated we would be asking southern lng to bifurcate the ferc proceeding into the vaporizer project that could proceed quickly and on an independent path to certification and the stabilization project that required considerably more technical analyses before it could proceed when i contacted mike varagona on friday november one seven two zero zero zero after we received a copy of southern lngs letter to the ferc he stated that he had not been advised by southern lng regarding its decision hence had not been positioned to return the favor mr varagona will be in houston on november two one and two two and he wants to meet with us he is still pushing for a commercial solution that sees el paso take on the quality risk in return for our firming up our volumes to el paso merchant energy at an improved price of henry hub plus approx zero zero eight per mmbtu let there be no doubt that el paso and southern lng will find a solution to the quality issue at little or no cost he said he would like to prepare us an outline of an offer to which i responded that he had nothing to lose by doing so the usual practice has been for enron to do this and for el paso to respond with i dont think that will work mr varagona also indicated that he did not see how the letter agreementterm sheet could form the basis of the commercial arrangement between our respective companies it just wont work as a consequence he stated that clarke smith head of el paso merchant energy has already contacted or will shortly contact our mike mcconnell to see if they can work to resolve this matter apparently these gentlemen have developed a good working relationship over the years he also alluded to the possibility that mr smith may have also contacted our stan horton for less than obvious reasons to me mr varagona further advised me that a dukewilliams joint venture had just acquired the rights to the gulfstream pipeline project from coastal divestment of this asset was required i understand as part of the el pasocoastal merger this situation gives added impetus to development of the cypress pipeline project by enron and el paso there is considerable merit in enron retaining the right to market its own gas out of the elba island lng terminal however we may find it desirable to reach some commercial resolution with el paso merchant energy for a portion of our volumes that also makes the quality issue disappear however should we decide to so compromise we must either fully engage southern lng in that solution or totally eliminate them from all aspects of our agreement with el paso in the case of southern lng we are dealing with one or more individuals who see only one way to do things namely their way and who are totally opposed to working with enron i would recommend any compromise with el paso merchant energy be conditioned on first reaching agreement with southern lng on explicit terms acceptable to us and checking it twice i would appreciate

over the last year secondly the location of the plants is a critical factortwo zero constellation has narrowed its competitive strategy to the northeast region and new york in particular is shaping up to be arguably the most important playing field for nuclear assets third owning the nine mile point plants will elevate constellations stature moving it ever close to become on par with its nearest competitor in the new york market entergy corp before i expand on the reasons why i think this is a such a pivotal move for constellation nuclear let me establish some of the important factors of the deal nine mile point is a twounit boiling water reactor site nine mile one began producing electricity in one nine six nine nine mile two began producin g electricity in one nine eight eight the two units are both located in scriba ny which is about four zero miles north of syracuse the nine mile point units have had rather spotty histories but over the last two years have shown signs of becoming strong performers niagara mohawk operates both units constellation nuclear is purchasing the plants from a group of several different utility owners niagara mohawk happens to be the sole owner of unit one unit two is owned by a group of coowners niagara mohawk four one percent new york state electric gas one eight percent rochester gas electrictwo zero corporation one four percent and central hudson gas electric corporation nine percent it is important to note that constellation nuclear is only able to purchase eight two percent of unit two because the long island power authority an additional coowner that controls one eight percent of unit two has opted not to sell its share of the plant at this time the sale came about in part as a result of the new york public service commission urging nuclear plant owners in the state to determine the market value of their plants through an open competitive process this is part of an overall effort to separate generation transmission and distribution activities within the state with that established i will continue to support my case that the acquisit ion of the nine mile point plants effectively supports constellation energys growth strategy in early two zero zero zero constellation began a restructuring of its corporate identity dividing its operations into two separate segments one focused on its merchant energy business including constellation nuclea r and the other focused on regional retail energy services the merchant energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the third quarter of two zero zero zero and the company is committed to expanding this growth the goal for the merchant energy business according totwo zero constellation energy ceo christian poindexter is to establish a portfolio of over three zero zero zero zero mw of electric generation facilities by two zero zero five toward that end constellatio n energy acknowledged earlier this year that it would be taking advantage of bargain prices for nuclear plants which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing on transmission operations and thus choosing or being mandated to divest their generation plants another important point is that the constellation nuclear services group a unit within constellation nuclear was established when baltimore gas electric another constellation energy subsidiary created a new area for its lifecycle license renewal activities thus most likely constellat ion will be applying to renew the licenses for the two nine mile point units and has a core group of people with expertise in this area license renewal s in general have been moving rather smoothly through the nrc so there shoul d not be any difficulty for constellation with regard to this process the only challenge might be that the two nine mile point units are very differe nt in age and could be viewed as two separate plants by the nrc presently constellations generation assets are based in a mixture of coal and nuclear the nuclear plant purchases that constellation is making expand upon its calvert cliffs asset an eight five zero mw twounit nuclear plant in southern maryland as natural gas prices are projected to rise for the foreseeable future buyers on the wholesale market may turn to coal and nuclear as substitutes for their power purchases thus constellation could be in a prime position if the desire for nucleargenerated power continues to rise as the company anticipates while constellation will most likely retain its coalfired generation assets the company is clearly moving closer toward a nuclearbased portfolio constellation has justified its move in this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is cheaper than coal and gas generators and that the economics of nuclear are quite robust once they are calculated out a key element of the acquisition that may get overlooked in the press relea ses is that constellation nuclear has secured a one zero year contract to provide electricity to the sellers at negotiated competitive prices specific terms of the deal are that constellation has agreed to sell nine zero percent of its share of the nine mile point plants output back to the sellers at an avera ge price of nearly three five mwh until two zero one zero this alone should provide a solid rate of return for constellations merchant energy business in addition as i indicated the new york location is key factor in this deal aside from its large population the state of new york is home to a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently for these two reasons alone new york stands out as the center within constellations focus on the northeastern united states yet constellations competitors also have the same plan and have all fought to gain assets in the region just within the last few months entergy corpzero one which also has based its strategy to a large extent on nuclearzero one has been aggressively making its own acquisitions of nuclear plants in new york state in fact entergy was competing against constellation nuclear as one of the other bidders for the nine mile point plants i know this because i spoke to carl crawfor d an entergy spokesperson back in august and he confirmed that entergy was actively attempting to purchase the two plants however despite the loss of the two nine mile point plants entergy retains a very strong nuclear presence in new york in late november entergy closed the sale on the new york power authoritys two nuclear power plants indian point unit three in westchester county and the james a fitzpatrick plant in oswego county in fact the purchase of the two plants from nypa marked the largesttwo zero acquisition to date in entergys nuclear strategy and also represented the highest purchase price nine six seven million ever of a nuclear asset earlier in the same month entergy completed a purchase of the indian point two plant from con edison altogether entergy now controls over three zero zero zero mw of nuclear generatio n in the state of new york consequently since clearly constellation nuclear wants to become one of the top nuclear power producers in the industry it will need to match entergy along with other competitors such as exelon and duke with regard to its nuclear portfolio there is only a limited number of nuclear plants that will become available for purchase and thus any acquisition of an operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in this particular market as a sidenote i established that niagara mohawk was one of the primary sellers of the nine mile point plants one zero zero percent of unit one and four one percent of unit two it is important to remember that niagara mohawk is being acquir ed by national grid a uk company that is considered one of the worlds largest independent transmission companies the acquisition of niagara mohawk is supporting national grids strategy of becoming a major presence in the transmission and distribution sectors of the us energy industry generation is not a high priority for national grid and the sale of niagar a mohawks nuclear assets resulted from this strategy moreover once again we see a case that represents the divergent approaches that different companies have toward deregulation in the united states whereas generation does not factor in to niagara mohawks current strategy it is a key component for constellation energy there are certainly risks associated with both approaches but the bottom line on this deal from my perspective is that constellation has acquired some valuable assets in a strong market its pretty obvious that constellation intends to be a contender in the nuclear arena especially in new york and owning the two nine mile point units should effectuate that goal three dthree dthree dthree dthree dthree dthree dthree dthree dthree dthree dthree dthree dthree dthree

volatility can change geographically in the electric markets last year the us midwestsouth areas were the peakiest but it reversed this year with the west being highest at the peaks and in new england but only in early may two zero zero zero were hgih peaks apparent there demand can vary from half the peak max to the max peakers can be on the margin on the upper half of the supply mix in many markets we need to watch gas prices this winter as they can effect winter peak power pricesnot just a summer phenomenon where are the most gas plants now on the margin ercot frcc neepool nypp serc wscc a disconnect there is a disconnect in the onpeak forward market price for power in texas now with the added five gw texas forward markets do not seem to take this into account yet note vince kaminski the texas forward market should be very soft next summer unless we return to one zero five degree f temperatures new england is just one year behind texas in its overbuild one main reason for the spikes in calif is power plants did not get built in calif due to a lack of a capacity charge and this is not a panaceaas calif also has many envirositing hurdles that challenge developers who want to site as well tsunami of merchant capacity planned cera sees over two four zero zero zero zero mw of planned capacity over the two zero zero zero two zero zero five period with two five zero zero zero mw being completed in two zero zero zero three five mw under construction for two zero zero one and one five zero zero zero mw under construction for two zero zero two but the market only needing one three zero zero zero to one five zero zero zero mw a year this shall lead to many and large deferrals and delays especially in two zero zero one and two zero zero two what has been the recent history us wide over the past three years just one one percent of the planned capacity was actually finished and one eight percent of that planned was actually under construction they assume a two four month construction completion time for profit transmission cera sees allegheny energy in pjm west entergy in spp southern in serc and alliant in mapp as all for profit transcos typical om costs in us transcos why do om costs differ widely among transcos some costs are three to eight times higher than the norm at five zero zero zero in om expense per five zero zero zero system miles in size regulatory overhang allows thisthis is weather adjusted to remove high costs from big freezes etc using real option model vs power plant npv you want to try to have the base value of an asset going forward when you expect volatility and include historical spreads and fuelpower price swing assumptions california market is broken this market starts to work only after it gets into a reliability crisis no incentives to add power plant capacity and huge hurdles against siting even when the market signals the need is there will the regulators post two zero zero zero fix make it worse peak power demand forecast as percent per year change vs two zero zero zero cera sees two zero zero one as follows new eng new york six three six two percent pjm ecar seven seven four four

2000-06-18,"[""'rebecca.cantrell@enron.com'""]","[""'jane.tholt@enron.com'""]","El Paso ADR Settlement Conference, June 12-13",in the final analysis we did not make a lot of progress in reaching agreement to settle the rpnine nine five zero seven proceeding on el pasos capacity allocation proposal at the conference in san francisco last week the parties have agreed to proceed on a dual track because of burlingtons concerns about timing we will reconvene for settlement discussions july one two and one three at southwest gass offices in las vegas after comments and reply comments are filed as permitted under the procedures agreed to at the may two technical conference at ferc comments are due june three zero and reply comments on july seven amoco and burlington filed the original complaint on september two one one nine nine nine and requested fasttrack processing under the commissions new complaint procedures burlington is pushing to have the commission adhere to the fasttrack processing of the complaint maintaining that an order should have been issued within two four zero days i dont know where they got that from i cant find any such requirement and vehemently opposed any attempts to extend the procedural schedule the tone of the meeting was set when harvey morris representing the cpuc was allowed to make a statement because he had to leave by one three zero the meeting started about one two three zero he started by saying that the cpuc was in complete opposition to the settlement proposal circulated by el paso on june six and then outlined all the reasons it was unfair to california shippers and was in violation of the nine six settlement after harvey spoke el paso then reviewed its june six settlement proposal which you received by email and provided some additional explanations of assumptions etc then the parties met in individual groups to caucus on their positions and reconvened as a group to discuss of particular note was the allocation of the three six zero mmd of san juanonly capacity that el paso proposed to take back from burlington nine seven jfour and amoco nine seven jb el paso said that it had been allocated one zero six mm to the havasu shippers one eight zero mm to the eoc shippers and seven four mm to all others california cd shippers this was a major point of contention in most of the ensuing discussions california shippers objected to eoc getting the lions share of the additional san juan capacity under el pasos proposal eoc shippers would get eight two of their rights from san juan and one eight from permian based on bds cd shippers on the other hand get six one and three nine respectively eoc shippers pointed out that the bds were not actually representative of their load bds were simply a number negotiated among the eoc shippers to allocate the costs that were allocated between eoc and california in the nine six settlement certain eoc shippers suggested that their specified rights should be based on some other calculation such as noncoincident peak day usage rather than bd another major issue was the proposal that full requirements shippers fr shippers be given systemwide receipt point rights in addition to the specified rights they would get based on their billing determinants bd el paso proposed that these systemwide rights would have a scheduling priority superior to that of a cd shipper using its capacity on an alternate firm basis either alternate receiptprimary delivery or alternate receiptalternate delivery of course the fr shippers approved of the proposal but most other parties objected to it several suggestions were advanced to try to reach a compromise for instance limiting fr shippers to primary specified receipt point rights during cycle one nominations but none were accepted most nonfr shippers stated concerns about the practical impact of giving fr shippers such a scheduling priority particularly since el pasos interpretation was that the fr shippers would not have to nominate any of their permian specified rights in order to come back to the san juan with the systemwide rights everyone pretty much agreed that el pasos proposal for capacity release of receipt point rights four in their writeup was a nonstarter it was put on the table to address an earlier suggestion by eoc shippers that if they could be made economically neutral to using nonsan juan points they might be more receptive to some restrictions on their specified rights what they were looking for was some discount for using permian and there was some further discussion along those lines but el paso was not receptive stating that such would mean opening the allocation of costs in the rate case a third issue was who gets what rights at socaltopock socal gas doesnt consider el pasos proposal not to sell block ii turnedback capacity to its topock point to be of much value since ferc has said they cant anyway socal gas is looking for a right to get out of any of its contract for which it cannot get a specified delivery point of socaltopock however socal gas cant at this point commit to the group a number that it could live with as a specified right at topock conversely all the other cd shippers who think they bought firm rights at socaltopock are not willing to see socal gas get all the rights unless they too can get out of their contracts fuel was the other contentious issue that seems to be a key sticking point for certain parties some insist it has to remain in the settlement others say there cant be a settlement if it stays in el pasos proposal would move the fuel rate back to four eight five effective two one zero zero by changing the way they eliminate fuel used in facilities that have been refunctionalized as gathering in the filing to be effective two one zero one the rate would go down to approximately four four and then to three eight eight on one one zero three burlington insists they will opt out of the settlement if they dont get relief on fuel apparently to the extent el paso doesnt include the costs of compressors that burlingtons gas utilizes in systemwide fuel they have to pay a higher fuel rate to el pasos gathering affiliate they say it has already cost them several million dollars i heard numbers between nine and two seven million no hard data and they will not settle without getting something in return after the full group discussion and statements of position on monday afternoon rick miles the ferc adr facilitator pushed for individual meetings between the various segments eoc california producers marketers el paso based on several parties representations that they were willing to continue talking a schedule was worked out and the individual meetings took up the morning on tuesday just before lunch the entire group got back together and accepted mr miles suggestion that each segment select three or four representatives who would then engage in a full discussion of the issues he felt that with a smaller group it might be easier to reach some understandings however it apparently didnt work because he called us all back late in the afternoon for a full group discussion where the positions outlined above were stated and restated certain parties when pressed could not agree to certain basic principles because they said they would have to get input from others in their organization mr miles expressed his frustration that parties were at the table who didnt know what their bottom line position was eg socal gas southwest gas following discussion by the producers particularly burlington as noted above that they would not agree to an extension of the date for filing comments the next settlement meeting was scheduled after the filing dates mr miles requested that parties send him an email note that would state their bottom line settlement position which he would keep confidential he would review all the positions and to the extent possible put then together and float a settlement package of his own he assured all that no one would be able to identify the individual positions from his package one positive note at this meeting was that there was no conflict over the pooling committees report no one registered any complaints although a few parties who had not been at the last settlement conference indicated that they would like to participate this is how i see our bottomline position i would like to send it to rick late this week if everyone agrees a pooling procedure that will follow assigned priority rankings for both market and supply with no restrictions on pooltopool transfers loops allowed only san juan receipt point rights on our havasu contract or preferably termination of the contract so that the san juan rights could be allocated to others as part of a settlement full requirements shippers systemwide rights above their specified point rights would not have a higher priority than cd shippers using alternate delivery points although no objection to using some allocation method other than billing determinants such as peak day volume to establish those specified point rights do you have any opinion about the allocation of socaltopock rights please give me a call when youve had a chance to look this over im sure youll have some questions also well need to talk about what kind of comments we want to

2001-01-10,"[""'david.merrill@enron.com'""]","[""'anthony.communications@enron.com'""]",Final Status Report of EBS East Asia Regulatory Matters,as many of you know i am going to be leaving enron to pursue new opportunities i am leaving with regret as i have enjoyed working with all of you and i believe ebs is poised for great success in asia to assist in a smooth transition i have prepared this report on the status of all ebs east asia regulatory affairs actions i am working on and my thoughts about next steps a list of key contacts is also provided mark schroeder will reassign pending actions again many many thanks for your support and encouragement and for what i have learned about broadband and ebs from each of you one singapore a sbo license application the application was completed in draft in december dan arzola of ebs asia has a copy in houston we cannot proceed further on the application until we decide what legal entity to use we have a legal entity enron broadband services pte ltd set up that encompasses all ebs activities including bandwidth t trading the legal entity that we use in the application will have to pay a one annual gross turnover fee unless we get it waived by the regulator on the grounds that the turnover fee was never intended to capture bandwidth trading revenue this is a possible option in my opinion as the regulator ida does not want to be working at cross purposes with other parts of the government that wish to provide ebs with incentives see below b legal due diligence however before pursuing a waiver from ida we were planning to complete legal due diligence to examine any options for avoiding the fee without a waiver donald is of the view see his jan nine email that bandwidth trading has to be licensed by the regulator in europe bandwidth trading usually does not require telecom licensing if donald is correct as he probably is there may be less need of further legal research on that point unless perhaps to confirm absolutely that there is no way to shield ebs bandwidth trading from the turnover fee apart from a waiver or reduction of the fee for example it is possible that jan haizmann or others may figure out a way to have actual trades escape the fee done offshore for example jan i believe has some ideas on this that he adanced in the context of korea i believe it would still be prudent to proceed as we had planned to engage a law firm here in singapore as we have in hong kong and japan for the purpose of guiding us through these sorts of questions or at least confirming our reading and answering the many other questions posed in a matrix developed by a working group headed by wayne gardner we will likely be needing the firm anyway at some point i have prepared a list of seven law firms engaged in telecoms practice in singapore ebs general counsel is planning to examine its asia strategy and whom to send and when to engage a firm to complete waynes questionnaire and for other purposes my advice is after the due diligence is completed or we have at least confirmed that bandwidth trading is required to be in the licensed entity probably to go to the ida and discuss the implications of the fee for us the contacts i would suggest discussing this with are andy haire and fiona yeo see contact list ida does not wish to prevent ebss coming to singapore and the fee was of course set up without bandwidth trading specifically in mind as a revenue source bandwidth trading was referenced in the code only later as a result of enrons comment letters c arthur d little consultant proposal to support ebs pioneer status application this seven five k proposal is now with us in final form after undergoing changes by me and two by our houston tax lawyers i was to have gone to adl singapore next for a meeting to question them on how much of this they are able to do independently without reliance on us this was a suggestion made by jim ginty of ebs tax to make sure they would not be reprocessing our info i also intended to get them to pinpoint which of the products would be quantified rather than a where appropriate assuming we proceed with this proposal someone else will need to do this conversation with adl singapore i have forwarded the final proposal to wayne garder and mark and most other interested parties earlier this week nb someone needs to be appointed to contact simon maccormac at adl and explain at least our timing and process for getting back to him as a courtesy i have not replied to his final submission as of now see contact info at end of email for background the reason i believe ebs needs this work and sought a consultant proposal is that pioneer status is typically awarded to companies that make major dollar infrastructure and jobcreation expenditures in singapore our business model does just the opposite so to be awarded pioneer status which the edb is very willing to consider us for after many months of persuasion i believe we need to help edb demonstrate what the quantitative spinoff benefits are for singapore from our developing bandwidth trading here eg increased efficiencies of capacity utilization effect of lower bandwidth prices on attracting investment this is a job for a development economist teamed with someone who knows about bandwidth trading to my mind if adl cannot produce the bandwidth trading specialist we want it might be worth it to have one of our experts assigned to liaise with them and adjust the contract accordingly to reflect what part we are providing one thing the adl scope of work does not provide for is the actual completion of the pioneer status application only the supporting economic analysis that is because it is proper for us to be the ones outlining our business plan for singapore rather than running that information through adl and charging its overhead the idea is to get adl to perform the quantitative economic development analysis we cannot do inhouse d direct contact with edb on ebss plans edb chelsia lim has this week asked ebs to update her on its business plans for singapore i have made sure craig clark will take the responsibility for seeing this is handled while a courtesy call is fine i would advise not to brief her formally until ebs has really decided what our plans are with staffing etc they have been asking for our plans for a while and are waiting for some specifics when we have them two hong kong we have two licenses ivans value added services and ets external telecoms services includes bandwidth trading there are several documents in draft and clearance which need to be filed under these licenses before we are able to operate in hong kong the principal ones are a the system configuration plan b the tariff for sale and trading of circuits under the ets license c the tariff for mediacast services under the ivans license and later d a tariff for vodeod to be filed under the ivans license a status of system configuration plan the plan is done in draft and is being held pending a decision to be communicated by roger estrada within the next week or two as to whether the lucent one zero g equipment described in the plan will be changed to other equipment the hk lawyers michelle chan of clifford chance have said that if we plan to provide other equipment at the outset we ought to just wait and send in the correct description rather than revise if we do stick with the lucent equipment we will also need to revise our orginal license application as well says michelle chan to include description of related cisco equipment that was not mentioned in our orginal license application when the system configuration plan is done in final we also need to change the listed destination in the diagram from san jose to west coast usa japan singapore and australia there are two copies of the present draft submission typed on the ofta forms i have given one to craig clark of ebs to carry back to houston the other copy is with annie ng in our singapore office when we know what equipment we are going to be using tom wei needs to revise the diagram and also make the changes in destination referred to above other small edits need to be made in appendix a see dec two eight email referenced below my successor should review the whole package once more with michelle chan in final then the final package needs to be cleared by anthony duenner and our ebs lawyers before going to ken rice or another qualified director of our hong kong company for signature after that it goes back to michelle chan for filing with ofta nb see michelle chans email of dec two eight being repeated separately for further information b tariffs for bwtrading under ets license in december in houston i worked with bill white and his staff on a tariff plan for bandwidth trading in hk based on a meeting i had with the regulator in hong kong we agreed to file pro forma ceiling prices rather than an entirely new and variable system which the regulator insisted we not do ceiling prices were developed and submitted to michelle chan for review along with the prices we are required to submit our terms and conditions for that i used ebs general terms and conditions gtcs for trading obtained from robbi rossi and michelle heard mike grimes has a set as well present status right now a dialogue is under way between michelle chan and robbi rossi as to whether it is sufficient to file the gtcs alone or whether certain exhibits service level agreements and confirmations referred to in the gtcs must also be filed there are other questions being discussed in that channel such as how to handle variations in the terms based on commercial dynamics all these emails will be forwarded once these issues related to the gtcs are resolved the tariff for bandwidth trading should be filed going through michelle chan nb see michelle chan email of one zero nine zero one which being forwarded separately c tariff for media cast under ivans license i worked with leroy ho and ken wang in december and we submitted the main part of the media cast tariff to michelle chan however we still need to get the terms and conditions for media cast from robbi rossi or michelle heard and attach them to the tariff diagrams and submit them to michelle chan nb see my email to michelle chan of dec two one which being repeated someone needs to work with ebs legal to get the t and cs for media cast to michelle or to set up direct channel between ebs legal and michelle chan as in the case of the exchanges on the t and cs for bandwidth trading referred to above d overall change of responsibility for ebs regulatory hk michael or whomever will be taking over these responsibilities should get from michelle chan of clifford chance hong kong a fresh copy of alison lindsays letter to xi xi of october two zero zero zero stating that we received our licenses and setting forth in detail all of the requirements this is the master document bible on compliance under our licenses and will catch any detail not included above for example my successor should also file a new form with ofta the hong kong regulator form is included in the attachments to the letter naming himself the point of contact replacing me michelle chan can forward the letter to the regulator we will need to be selecting an independent auditor to certify certain routine reports we may need to file in future i have not started on that three korea robbi rossi needs to call kim and chang law firm we use in korea to authorize them to research and provide advice to us on how to handle the apparent regulatory impediment to bandwidth trading in korea that we identified during my november trip once kim and chang starts work on this someone from regulatory should be made available to help guide kim and chang on our regulatory questions in coordination with robbi rossi the key emails are a one from me outlining the overall problem and some suggestions for dealing with it b one from jan haizmann with some additional and in some cases alternative suggestions on how to deal with it c two from jae moo lee in korea with additional points of view these will be forwarded four japan our regulatory consultant is art yanagawa contact info below mike grimes and i have been in meetings with him and mike is fully briefed to carry on the ontheground part of contacts with art art also responds to donald and roger estrada and relies on them for guidance and input at some point it should be thought through who should be the point person to manage this contract and approve payments or decide to leave things as they are with approvals done in houston the present system works but it is not clear to me who is responsible for what art has prepared the amendment to our special type two license to add service to other destinations the latest status was that he was holding the amendment over the holidays while clarifying some points raised by mike grimes someone needs to be assigned responsibility for getting the amendment through general concern a more general regulatory concern for us in japan is that our consultant advises us that we cannot use the term bandwidth trading in communications with the government because it is not something contemplated in the telecom business law so is prohibited if stated as we would state it elsewhere we therefore are having to go through elaborate contortions to make what we are planning to do actually look like we are doing something else i admit that i agree with the approach we are taking for now and can offer nothing better for the immediate term however i would say that long term we are running some risks if we are going to make japan one of the centerpieces of our asia ebs strategy i think we need to consider devoting more full time ebs regulatory resources to japan exclusively the allocation problem is that whatever regulatory resources we apply have to focus on immediate license amendment and operational questions that drive out time to work effectively on long term issues such as how to go about amending the telecommunications business law to allow bandwidth trading explicitly this would seem important to reduce long term risks to our business strategy five digital divide i had been giving intermittent support to helping scott yeager and justin cornett of ebs and will reed of technology for all figure out how to expand the concept of technology for all to asia the strategy was to utilize some of japans one five billion pledge of funds to support digital divide activities in asia to support the expansion into asia of the ebssupported tfa model this work will cease unless it can be picked up by laura lannarone of corporate social responsbility or steve burns

profit tax fyi preliminary analysis of state windfall profit tax this will be discussed during the cc scheduled for nine zero zero am today wed original message from c stephen davis mailtocsdlawpacbellnet sent wednesday april zero four two zero zero one eight three three am to steven kelly cc douglas k kerner subject proposed windfall profit tax gentlemen i understand that the some of the democratic leadership of the california legislature is contemplating a charge against the electricgenerating industry in retaliation for recent price increases the charge is to be styled as a windfall profit tax modeled on president carters tax on oil company profits following deregulation of oil prices in one nine eight zero the crude oil windfall profit tax act of one nine eight zero two six usc four nine eight six et seq the carter windfall profit tax was levied on the difference between the current wellhead price of the oil and the sum of the adjusted base price set by congress multiplied by the applicable rate i understand the california charge will similarly be calculated by reference to a one nine nine nine base price and current prices to which difference some sort of tax rate will be applied you asked whether this approach to punishing electric wholesalers was infirm from either a policy or legal perspective the basic policy problem is that the tax will discourage sales of electricity in california california will become the market of last resort another problem is that the tax might be seen as promoting a california first policy at the expense of other states this is so because the tax could well be included in the ferc rate base as taxes other than income taxes and thereby be shifted to other customers the tax may suffer from legal flaws as well the principal problem is preemption by the federal power act the states are prohibited from regulating wholesale power rates as a direct burden on interstate commerce the proposed charge whether called a windfall profit tax or an excise tax or a sales or use tax or something else is underground rate making there is little or no practical difference between a rate cap and a tax on all revenues measured with reference to a certain price point from the perspective of the interstate electric wholesaler thus the burden on interstate commerce posed by direct rate regulation and taxing revenues using a price base is comparable the tax may also constitute an unconstitutiional taking if the price allowed is less than the cost of production and a reasonable return the proposed historical base price will not for example reflect recent fuel price increases two other potential issues arise as well first the tax has many of the hallmarks of a use tax ie the tax is levied on the purchase of goods from an outofstate provider for delivery to and use in california the gross receipts form the sale of electricity have been exempt from sales and use tax for more than five zero years rev tax code section six three five three while this statute could presumably be amended doing so would be a major policy departure and a big step towards imposing sales tax on utility sales a second concern is the possible impairment of existing contracts as a result of the legislatures meddling in rate regulation i was unable to identify any instance in which a state imposed a windfall profit tax on electricity sales the forgoing is the product of my conversations last evening with doug kerner and a few hours of lexis research the issues are complex and could not be much developed in the time available this material is best viewed as informed issue spotting nevertheless i feel strongly that the proposed tax can fairly be characterized as rate making very truly yours c stephen

they apply to generator interconnection eg the dispute resolution provision of the tariff currently only applies to transmission service not interconnection service although i havent done a detailed review of pges tariff i noted similar concerns about sections six seven three and one one also transmission service should be capitalized some other suggestions preamble sentence three delete these interconnection procedures do not provide for transmission service on the transmission system insert these interconnection procedures apply only to the receipt point portion of transmission service on the transmission system sentence four delete of the transmission system parts ii and iii are defined terms section two two under this provision if the interconnection customer makes changes to the information supporting its interconnection request that materially affect its interconnection it can lose its place in the queue given how much discretion this gives pge materially affect should be a defined term or have a standard for its application section three one revise the last sentence as follows the interconnection customer must execute complete and return further pge should add a provision indicating that if its merchant function desires interconnection that it should have to follow the interconnection procedures section three four this section should be amended to require that the short circuit and stability study take into consideration higher queued projects section three four iii power flow studies are only necessary for transmission service not just for interconnection accordingly section iii should be changed to have the information studied for the customers information only or to say that it is not related to the interconnection queue section four one when does the customers responsibility to respond to higherqueued projects end does this extend the six zero day period every time it happens section four four in sentence two delete network upgrade necessary to remove overloads and work the following definitions into section four four interconnection facilities means the local equipment necessary to connect the plant to the point of interconnection including increasing the capacity of an existing local transmission lines to loop the lines into the plant in the case where the capacity of the line is less than the capacity of the generating plant under good utility practice network upgrades mean modifications beyond interconnection facilities required for safe and reliable connection of the generating plant to the utility

procedure comments two three delete last sentence if enron is already in the queue or considered in a queue before a tps interconnection procedures are filed at ferc we dont want to have to resubmit something within one five days in order to remain in the queue i dont think this is necessary and all are protected because preexisting requests will be posted on oasis on the queue four three enron has argued for six zero days consistent with the oatt times lost unfortunately it may look odd for pge to ask for nine zero days pge is protected because if it legitimately takes longer than six zero days you send a notification six i realize that this language was included in cpl but recommend these changes for pge six one add after as modified by the commission if customer chooses to commence construction six two modify last sentence the agreement will provide milestones toward placing the generator in service that the interconnection customer must make reasonable progress toward or it

market regional plans jim a big external factor that is directed to the item two iso systems procedures at the nerc electronic scheduling task force meeting today there was considerable discussion on how this task force which was formed before the oasis anopr was posted would coordinate on an industrywide basis a nerc response to the oasis phase ii anopr here are some important points a ferc staff member marv rosenberg made at the meeting these should be kept in mind in developing the enron proposal and the process of getting buyin in each of the regionsrtos ferc prefers a single industry consensus filing the anopr is intended to tie rto order two zero zero zero together with new oasis ii requirements does not preclude individual rtos or entities from submitting proposals however a diversity of filings will indicate nonconsensus and ferc will make its own decisions which will likely not be industry friendly ferc is asking the industry for communication and business practices standards for issuing in a nopr ferc is looking for more functionality and to be more userfriendly electronic scheduling electronic reservations reduce duplication of information entry for customers not intended to dictate the control area to control area communications i asked marv to clarify this he explained that although not required ferc welcomes propsals to address the control area sourcesink issues as part of an oasis ii solution ie entergy sourcesink order oasis ii should continue use of web browsers use templates for file transfers uploads and downloads all displays do not have to look the same but encourages a common look and feel within a rto business practicese may differ but between rtos the practices must be standardized we need to keep close to the nerc efforts since ferc has historically tended to favor nerc proposals because they tout an air of industry consensus the clarificaton to the anopr given by marv should make buyin an important element of our proposal if ferc adopts the nerc filing we will likely be stuck with the exisiting contract path seams problems and lmp fragmentation in the east because nerc is not proposing any tariff changes also we will not get the control area sourcesink issue resolved since it will be impossible to resolve at nerc in seven months of course another option would be to incorporate our efforts with this task

everyone who participated in the call today i think that the discussion proved that we can find consensus on a reasonable approach for transmission pricing and energy markets two to make more clear about the regional plans i think that we need to consider the following a background timelines of current process current players current positions allies key issues now facing the process b moving forward top issues upcoming external factors eg will entergy join spp resource needs relationship to commercial objectives business plans c other issues conclusion i hope this helps set an outline for the regional plans the key idea is that i want to make sure everyone has a calendar of where we are going and what issues need to be addressed dont be shy about adding other topics and issues we need to have this to communicate within our group and to the commercial people i dont expect this to be easy but i think that it will be helpful three i think that we need to put more detail around the entire structure this would entail developing four things one a tariff two iso systems procedures three day ahead px energy market four transmission flowgate px market these are the four building blocks to a new marketplace my hope is for enron to put these things out in a detailed framework using off the shelf material i know that tom delaney has already started working on a tariff i think we could adapt the cal px model into point three we could probably use the apx flowgate system for point four on the iso maybe we could go to esca and have a detailed scope work plan and fees on setting up an iso including costs of operation over time it would make sense to me to do this very formally including setting energy market zones and defining the commercially significant flowgates i would use the miso as the market to focus on but am willing to listen to other thoughts please let me know what everyone thinks jim,00:07:00,"Yes

seven four five am subject what to do if gore wont concede after a bush victory are we having fun embarrassing our nation mr gore what do you hope to prove cry baby its getting nasty what to do if gore wont concede after a bush victory al gores campaign chairman william daley has indicated that if the recount shows a bush victory gore will not concede daley together with warren christopher have suggested that they will take the situation to the courts in case the democrats refuse to relinquish power here is a suggested course of action united republican fund of illinois chicago november nine two zero zero zero from joseph a morris president to urf leaders and friends herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take in the event that the florida recount confirms the election of george bush but al gore fails to concede we all know what is going on in florida and that the election hinges on the outcome i am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will have to do if what i think is going to happen actually does the recount which will be finished by five pm thursday will likely show bush to be the winner once again with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted those ballots will be overwhelmingly for bush a minimum of six zero and probably closer to seven five if the count goes our way tomorrow we have won this election this is when something critical happens either gore bows out gracefully or he doesnt and i can almost guarantee he wont these are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming they will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election in one nine six zero when richard nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didnt for the sake of the country expect no such noble behavior this time what will they try one bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the florida results on a flimsy premise they are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in palm beach county i have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least indeed they are identical in form to the punchcard ballots used in chicago and cook county illinois in this very election what is more it is just as likely that palm beach county voters who wanted to vote for bush inadvertently voted for nader all parties approved the form of ballot before the election the formofballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the florida election while i hope this scenario doesnt come to pass i fear that it will and it will only have disastrous results for the country the election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court if this comes to pass the vision of our founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed personally i am not going to stand for this and i hope you wont either the good news is that we are not without voice here is what must be done if the vote count affirms bushs election we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the gore camp if they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials at every level with phone calls of outrage that demand gores concession i mean literally millions of phone calls we must jam their phone banks with callsthere are millions of us so it shouldnt be too difficult while youre at it send emails to your local newspapers as well if it becomes widely reported and it will that there is a groundswell demanding that gore back down and not embarrass the

august one six two zero zero one eight four eight am to hall steve c belden tim yoder christian oneil murray p foster chris h williams iii bill stokley chris comnes alan foster chris h gilbert scotty subject re letter sent to the iso on creditworthiness this article appears to be addressing the letter sent by steve hall via the iep to the caiso its good reading kit published thursday august one six two zero zero one group questions power payments power crisis by mike taugher contra costa times an industry trade group asked market officials on wednesday why they have failed to pay more than one billion for power sold during april and may for some reason the money is not getting from the ratepayers to the generators said jan smutnyjones director of the independent energy producers association our hope is that this is a temporary misunderstanding part of the answer officials said is that the states powerbuying agency is refusing to pay its bills in full until it gets more information about who ultimately receives the cash compounding the problem is the fact that when the may bills began coming due earlier this month some market participants who were owed money from previous months credited their own accounts instead of paying in full according to the independent system operator that left the iso less able to pay its may bills said iso president and ceo terry winter in a written statement the iso acknowledges that past debt is due winter said in the statement winter said the iso would respond more fully to address questions about the underpayments by friday but in response to the iep letter he demanded that market participants quit crediting their own bills the iso runs the spot markets in california buyers and sellers make their bids through the iso which sets the market price based on those bids collects payments from the buyers and divvies them up to the sellers the issue came to a head wednesday when the iep sent a letter to the iso demanding to know why generators were not paid in full for electricity sold in april and may smutnyjones said estimates of unpaid amounts during that period ranged around one two billion in early april federal regulations went into effect that essentially barred the financially broke utilities from buying power in the iso market that forced the state department of water resources which began buying electricity in january to pick up the entire unmet need of the utilities customers dwr spokesman oscar hidalgo said that the state is required to compile certain information about bills it pays before it pays them we havent been given what we feel is an adequate accounting of what were going to be paid for hidalgo said we are working with the iso to see how we can get some of that information that were not getting iso spokesman gregg fishman said his agency is working with the water department but that market tariffs require that some information be kept confidential we cant

williams was almost too impressive to believe hes big at about six three or maybe six four and a little over two zero zero pounds we should get official heights and weights tuesday and he is fast one zero zero three one zero zero meters last track season and no one could cover him monday he caught so many long passes i lost count pitty poor nathan vasher the lone scholarship db among the freshmen he had to try to cover williams b j johnson sloan thomas and tony jeffery the best group of freshman wide receivers in the country as soon as he got through with one and got a little breather it was on to the next one vasher actually did a good job most of the time on everybody except williams who was just too big and too strong for him to handle vasher does a good job of man coverage getting right with the wide receiver and staying with him on most occasions also pity poor qb chance mock who probably threw more passes monday than he did in his whole career at the woodlands he showed great accuracy and touch on long and short passes and offensive coordinator greg davis complimented him for having a quick release but ill bet his arm is sore tuesday coach mack brown said he doesnt normally want to play freshmen particularly early in the season but he said it is easier for wide receivers to play early than for most other players take our two freshmen defensive ends kalen thornon and adam doiron brown said they are very good prospects but they have never lined up against anybody like leonard davis and thats what theyll start doing when the veterans show up their learning curve goes up pretty drastically and they probably will need some time to cope with that but he said its a different story with wide receivers if a receiver can run jump catch and do something after he catches it brown said we can make the offense simpler for him darryl drake the wide receiver coach phrased it another way saying if a guy is six three or six four can run close to a one zero flat hundred meters and high jump seven feet williams did all that last year at odessa permian well just tell him to run down the field and if anybody can keep up with him theyre probably short cornerbacks and he can outjump them for the ball well coach him next year but he can get by with the speed and jumping ability this year drake was only partially kidding when williams has to try to get off the line against bigtime correrbacks like quentin jammer and roderick babers the two ut starters it will be harder but brown said all the receivers are going to get a lot of work against bumpandrun coverage he also said he expects at least two of them to play a lot early in the season thomas johnson and jeffery also had some good plays thomas made one great catch of a high ball that appeared to be out of his reach one ut assistant coach told me today he has never seen backtoback classes as outstanding as the two the longhorns have put together the last two years the freshmen will have their final workouts as a group tuesday the varsity reports wednesday and the first full team workouts will be friday recruiting notes the news got as little better today on the states best quarterback matt nordgren six five two one seven four six two of dallas bishop lynch he visited colorado unofficially last weekend and came back very impressed and saying he wants to delay his decision on picking a college but he told me today the longhorn coaches are recruiting two quarterbacks bret rawls of louisiana powerhouse shreveport evangel is the other one and they gave us both a deadline of october one five and told us to look around and be sure what we want to do i think that is a real sign of class he said ill probably take some official visits before that maybe to colorado kansas lsu and

times home edition msix copyright two zero zero zero the times mirror company san diego what a difference four years make for department of water and power customers with passage of electricity deregulation in one nine nine six an uncompetitive dwp clung to life unable to pay down its four billionplus powergeneration debt and saddled with high rates for large business customers it faced the prospect of a death spiral if it entered a deregulated marketplace commercial customers threatened to flee to lowercost energy suppliers while residential customers could be forced to pay large fixed costs as a result the dwp shunned deregulation yet by this summer as san diego gas electrics ratepayers the first to be exposed to market forces faced a doubling even tripling of their electric bills the dwps three eight million customers basked in low rates and a large power surplus more remarkable the dwp is even being touted today as a model for proposed municipal utilities in cities hardhit by escalating electricityrate increases what accounts for this startling turnaround while current management deserves credit the dwps position also is a product of longerterm policy and investment decisions since its creation nearly one zero zero years ago the department has made lowcost waterandpower reliability its policy cornerstone ezra f scattergood founder of the dwps power system relentlessly pursued cheap hydroelectric powernearly all from hoover damand by one nine four zero la boasted the nations lowest power rates yet with postwar population and industrial growth new and more expensive ways had to be found to meet burgeoning demand starting in the one nine seven zero s stringent state airquality regulations which eliminated fossilfuelfired plants in california created the need for large expensive power stations in utah and arizona the dwps new power came from four large steamgenerating plants in the la basin partnerships in outofstate coalfired and nuclear plants an intertie connection to the energyrich pacific northwest and the peakload castaic pump storage facility as a result the dwp accumulated nearly seven zero zero zero dependable megawatts of generation well above this summers peak demand of five three zero zero megawatts for the dwp to have entered the deregulated marketplace early on it needed to pay off the large debt created by its investments in distant energy sources and offer competitive rates for large business customers under deregulation debt relief came at the cost of reduced reliability investorowned utilities such as southern california edison could pay off debts like the san onofre nuclear power plant with a transitional surcharge added to ratepayers bills but participating utilities were forced to sell their power plants so that transmission and generation lay in separate hands the dwps decision to pass on deregulations guarantee of debt relief was risky while municipal utilities were given the option of fully entering the marketplace in two zero zero two there was little evidence that the dwp could unilaterally pay off its huge debt since its revenue in part was used to fund other projects like mayor richard riordans police buildup while the citys elected officials approved residential rates two zero below privateutility charges they balked at lowering rates for large businesses that were higher than for rival utilities because big businesses would be the first to enter the deregulated marketplace many believed the dwp would have to be privatized to be competitive yet since one nine nine six the debt of the uncompetitive dwp has been halved and the agency plans to be debtfree within two years it now sells surplus power to other utilities accelerating debt payoff adding nine six zero megawatts of capacity over the past several years by restarting mothballed plants the dwp in its justapproved one zero year one seven billion capital program will provide two nine zero zero megawatts of new generating power as the states investorowned utilities and their ratepayers face a doubling or more of energy prices until new plants come on line the department plans to offer a five rate reduction by two zero zero two armed with low rates and a large surplus it is vigorously promoting alternativeenergy sources the departments current management deserves some credit for the turnaround dwp general manager david freeman has adroitly used that deregulated market for surplus sales and debt relief forging an alliance with the departments largest labor union freeman has wrung concessions from a laborfriendly city council freeman also engineered the sale of the dwps share of a poorly performing plantthe mohave facilitywhile planning upgrades of cleaner plants in the la basin that will significantly add to the departments energy reserves by continuing to say no to deregulation the dwp can ensure los angeles future economic competitiveness it and other public utilities are the states lowestcost providers of electricity they possess the reserves needed to provide ultrahigh reliability to an electricitydependent economy although they do not return profits to shareholders public utilities can be operated as efficiently as their private counterparts if freed from political interference until the states energy crisis is fixed the high cost of electricity and the associated uncertainty in deregulated regions will result in business and job losses to oases of lowcost reliable public power such as los angeles pasadena glendale burbank anaheim azusa vernon riverside colton and sacramento the dwps stunning success in a deregulated market has caught the attention of san diego where ratepayers have suffered the most and san francisco in san diego suburban san marcos decided to create a municipal utility two weeks ago and chula vista is considering one a local congressman has urged voters to create a countywide municipalutility district using the initiative another more conservative congressman has suggested that local governments build and operate gasturbine power plants at the miramar marine corps air station to lower electricity prices and meet demand a similar grassroots movements for energy independence via municipal ownership is afoot in the bay area which faces the deregulated marketplace in two zero zero two californias illconceived experiment with deregulation has turned the oncestaid utility world upside down in the process severely blurring the lines between private and public under the one nine nine six law investorowned utilities received massive state and ratepayer subsidies to pay off past debts today these same utilities are petitioning state officials for subsidized rate relief yet las department of water and power and other municipal utilities have not received one cent of state assistance for debt relief or rate stabilization by staying the course of reliability and forsaking deregulation the dwp furnishes a valuable lesson in the tangible benefits of public ownership graphicdrawing no caption wes bausmith los angeles times,08:29:00,No
