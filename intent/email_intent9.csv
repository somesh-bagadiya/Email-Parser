allega tion that the beep stack is not reliable bc generators are not following d ispatch instructions massey wants caiso to promptly inform the commission where they believe an entity is not complying with the tariff or failing t o follow the dispatch instruction two the second set of orders involves three dockets a a new two zero six rulemakin g regarding marketbased rate authority b

pursuant to the order in b ferc is putting out a new rulingmaking regarding marketbased rate authorit y to close what they find to be a flaw with existing tariffs in the wake of californias problems the rulemaking initiated today calls for the impos ition of a refund provision in all marketbased rates the refund requirem ent attaches to bad behavior such as economic or physical withholding or other anticompetitive actions apparently there is a portion of the rulema king that asks for comments within one five days during discussion massey poin ted out that no bad behavior was found in

authority ferc is now establishing a supply margin analy sis sma to replace the hub spoke analysis used to determine the pres ence of market power the sma looks for pivotal suppliers based on peak demand within a market the definition of the market would recognize the r ole of transmission constraints a generator is considered pivotal where its supply is required to meet system peak demand if such status is foun d the marketbased rate authority does not extend to those peak conditions and instead the applicable rates are a costbased rate that is applicable only to the uncommitted unit capacity rates for any such capacity would be posted in incs and decs for that uncommitted capacity this policy revi sion occurs in the context of a triennial review of market based rate autho rity

above it was held for so me revisions and is expected to come out either later today or tomorrow t he context for this order is the huntington beach application the languag e revisions are aimed at

forced to pay a six nine zero million debt by next week and reduced its alreadyabysmal thirdquarter earnings the houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on monday with us securities and exchange commission among the new information included is the disclosure that enron is up against a short deadline to meet a six nine zero million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week that marked the start of a nineday period that expires on nov two six during which enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships if not the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership which includes a brazilian natural gas company that enron was counting on selling to raise two five zero million in cash the company is working to make alternative payment arrangements since it can illafford to pay the debt now enron has already already maxed out its three billion credit line secured roughly two billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat enron also reduced previously reported two zero zero one thirdquarter earnings by three cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first nine months of the year by a penny per share the move reflects adjustments made after the quarters end enron said on oct one six enron reported a loss of six three eight million or eight four cents per share for the third quarter of two zero zero one on nov eight enron said it had restated earnings for one nine nine seven two zero zero zero and that net income for the fouryear period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported it also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay three nine billion to other partnerships the bulk of it to osprey trust and marlin water trust such an outcome would keep enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and would likely have a material adverse impact on enrons ability to continue as a going concern the company wrote enron had released those figures earlier but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability credit could be a killer moodys investors service and standard poors this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for enron to baathree and bbbminus just one notch above junk status each warned it may cut its respective ratings again moodys also cut enrons shortterm debt rating which affects commercial paper to not prime a junk rating in nearly all of its partnership deals enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels at the close of trading monday on the new york stock exchange enron shares were at nine zero six well below the trigger prices all of the partnerships which enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet have become the onceproud companys bane the sec is investigating potential conflictofinterest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow served as general partner enron had to extract itself from those partnerships which led to a one two billion reduction in enron shareholder equity the revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory leaving enron to be bought on nov nine by smaller crosstown rival dynegy inc dynn for the firesale price of nine billion in stock in an unusual note enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant per sec regulations because of the need of arthur andersen llp enrons independent auditors to complete their review procedures arthur andersen had no comment but enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by enrons board of directors to look into its

caiso because of power supply situations rotating outage plans are then required to be implemented by the utilities in order to reduce their power supply requirements ie electric loads the utilities chose to implement their rotating outage plans by dropping various distribution circuits that do not have essential customers connected to them on a rotating basis because it is cheap and easy to implement less controversial and less politically sensitive the following are my comments my main concern is with regards to the way they propose to handle direct access customers direct access customers should not be included in pges mandatory curtailment plan mcp because the power that these customers are using is not coming from pge anymore their power supply requirements are being met by their esps pges proposal is treating transmission level customers like utilities the only difference this time is that pge is acting like the regulator controlling the customer at a minimum the cost of implementing their proposal should be paid for by pge and not the transmission customers nonfirm customers such as ibm should not be included or be required to participate in their mcp anymore because their loads are dropped down to the minimum or essential levels by the caiso first even before a state of emergency is declared there is a minimum load level that facilities require in order

travel advisory access to the enron center over the next few days the following access control procedures will be ins tituted at the enron center and other facilities where practical zero nine as employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the enron center a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer zero nine employees and contractors who forget their badges must

do not have permanent resident alien status carry th eir passport form inine four and form iseven nine seven at all times we would also suggest that permanent resident aliens carry their permanent resident green card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure it appears that immi gration officials may be applying a section of the immigration and national ity act that requires individuals over the age of one eight to carry hisher regi stration documentation with them at all times this can include a permanen t resident card form inine four card employment authorization card border cros sing card or a temporary resident card immigration officials have not his torically been asking domestic travelers for registration documentation but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c urrent lawful status we will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the

in northern california the bloomberg index for peak power climbed two zero four five from yesterday to six one eight eight with trades completed at five seven zero zero six five zero zero traders said power prices were rising with the return of heavier weekday loads and uncertainty over whether or not all generation currently available will be operating after the weekend even though temperatures have been near normal they should increase next week which will boost air conditioning load in the southwest said one southwest trader at the spone five delivery point in southern california peak power increased one five five six to a bloomberg index of six three four four with sales completed at five five zero zero six nine zero zero in the southwest power prices jumped an average of two two eight six at the palo verde switchyard to a bloomberg average of seven five zero zero amid trades in the six seven zero zero eight five zero zero range according to lexington massachusettsbased

philadelphia june eight bloomberg energy nextday power prices rocketed to monthly highs throughout the northeast us this morning on anticipated higher weatherrelated cooling loads traders said in the

one zero am local time according to weather services corp of lexington massachusetts temperatures in philadelphia and baltimore two of the regions primary load centers will peak at eight two and eight one degrees fahrenheit monday respectively nextweek packages also sold higher in anticipation of increased cooling loads though traders said the market was very volatile representative of continued skepticism about conflicting weather forecasts parcels for june one one one five traded as high as four seven zero zero and as low as four three five zero some people are still feeling skiddish about these forecasts said one pjmbased trader weathers not an exact science a lot of people are buying into the hype but others are holding out until the heat actually materializes in the new england power pool formonday power was assessed four nine five higher at an index price of four one seven zero trades spanned a tight range of four one five zero four two zero zero with most deals completed on the lower end marketers said new england traders cited strong realtime prices and rising temperatures as the primary reasons for the climb in spite of healthy generation in the pool weve seen comparatively strong prints or realtime prices said one trader while temperatures have yet to do anything impressive no ones willing to short themselves this early in the season you can afford to go flat to long karyn rispoli warmer monday forecast drives midcontinent power prices higher cincinnati june eight bloomberg energy prices for peak power delivered monday in the midcontinent us climbed today as warmer weather boosted demand from the south traders said the bloomberg index price for power delivered into the cincinnatibased cinergy corp transmission system rose one zero zero four to four one four four a megawatthour with trades ranging from four five zero zero down to three five zero zero after options expired east central area reliability council traders said the cinergy market opened at four four zero zero on the strength of yesterdays nextweek market then rose to the days high amid buying pressure from marketers traders said once prices hit four five zero zero players began selling excess power to the tennessee valley authority grid where hot weather forecasts boosted demand for imports as utilities in tva filled positions and buyer interest lessened prices plunged concerns about weatherrelated demand also pushed shortterm overthecounter prices up as power for tuesdayfriday delivery next week was offered as high as four six five zero however traders said with recent inaccurate weather forecasts the market could either rise or fall next week it could get hot thats the main concern an ecar trader said theres a lot of variables though if the weather comes in and we get into the gas stack we could see six zero power if not we could see three zero power its going to be interesting in the midamerica interconnected network formonday power at the chicagobased commonwealth edison hub again traded at a discount to cinergy climbing nine six zero to three five zero zero four four zero zero as temperatures werent expected to be as high as in cincinnati weve still got five zero something degree lake water and if the breeze blows off the lake into the city its definitely going to be cooler here than at cinergy one trader said power in lower main sold one zero eight four higher on average at three eight zero zero four six zero zero amid heavy demand from the new orleansbased entergy corp grid where monday parcels sold one zero seven two higher at four one zero zero five one zero zero traders said midcontinent area power pool dayahead power sold higher again today though transmission problems limited volume in the region traders said formonday parcels traded one three one seven higher on average at three seven zero zero four two zero zero in northern mapp and one one nine three higher on average at three eight zero zero four five zero zero in the southern half of the region its going to be warmer down in spp the southwest power pool than it is here so everyone wants to export a mapp trader said the problem is we dont know how transmission will hold up so no one is selling as much as theyd like ken fahnestock most southeast power prices climb with weekend risk weather nashville tennessee june eight bloomberg energy spot electricity prices for power delivered monday rose throughout most of the southeast us because of weekend risk premiums associated with forecasts for warmer weather traders said lexington massachusettsbased weather services corp predicted high temperatures would be eight nine degrees fahrenheit in nashville and nine one degrees in new orleans monday electricity parcels for delivery monday into the tennessee valley authority transmission grid traded at three seven zero zero four seven zero zero a megawatthour with the bloomberg index price at four three zero six up one zero eight nine from yesterday traders said strong prices at the cincinnatibased cinergy corp grid a primary source of import power caused tva to open with high trades as utilities filled positions prices dropped on the new orleansbased entergy corp grid formonday power sold one zero seven two higher on average with the market opening at five one zero zero and trading down to four one zero zero after options expiration market conditions at entergy were similar to those at tva though traders said transmission problems complicated their attempts to import power from the north although prices at both the tva and entergy hubs fell during the day traders said the market could recover and trade up monday if temperature forecasts are accurate and typical transmission problems occur limiting imports from the midwest the last time you had a lot of people in the southeast buying from cinergy tlrs transmission line loading relief measures kicked in when delivery started one trader said if that were to happen again things could very well take off because wed be getting into gas to meet the load were expecting he said the exception to higher prices was the floridageorgia border market where peak power for monday delivery sold six zero zero less on average at three seven five zero three eight five zero traders there said transmission problems eliminated the ability to move power into florida causing prices at the border to separate from the instate market with imports unavailable peak instate parcels traded up two five zero at six two five zero six three five zero because of increased reliance by utilities on highpriced gasfired power to meet heavy cooling demand temperatures in much of the state were forecast in the low nine zero degrees monday according to weather services ken

zatarain brian subject procaribes next cargo miguel as we analyze what and how to deal with your next cargo requirements we need the following information current levels of inventory at procaribe broken down between your own and ecos product projected as of end of september please provide basis ie levels of as of the actual date that you provide data plus your projections through end of the month on withdrawalsuses projected sales volumes for the months of october november december and january of next year including and this is very critical the basis for your projections i am going to be interested in looking at your assumptions for both progasco now tropigas and empire volumes if any please ensure that your san juan gas volumes have been signed off by federico we need this data as soon as you can so that we can begin to look at cargo options andor evaluate the decision to borrow from eco thanks and regards mariella paul believe it or not yes call me crazy i went home last night and continued to study the examples of hedging you were so kind to walk us through and arrived at the following conclusions which i would like for you to correct me on andor confirm my thought process first given the added uncertainty of procaribes volumes sales now that progasco is owned by someone else unless miguel can guarantee through some form of written agreement that he will have progascos volumes i think we should be more open to or more inclined to borrow ecos volumes clearly we wouldnt do so if the curve looks awful then it becomes an issue of cash flow vs product pricing optimization ybarbo paul without the progasco volume it will take much longer to selloff this cargo the hedging would be different if humberto unexpectedly showed up to buy the timing of our hedge would be off i think we should signup humberto for novdec at whatever we can get come january it will be a new ballgame as empire will need to get a new contract with pdvsa we could probably up our price at that time second it seems to me that you wouldnt me too inclined to try to fix the cost of your product bought from say pdvsa unless you are very concerned about an increasing curve right around the three days surrounding the bill of lading that will not necessarily stay long enough to keep your sales curve up to guarantee a margin in fact you would likely wait and continue to watch the curve and either not act at all or act shortly before the bill of lading dates now in your may hedging example if you actually compare the hedged vs nonhedged results it tells you that you were better off with a no hedge on the earlier months month for which data on the revenue side was known and most of the curve deciding your price to pdvsa was also known then my question is why did we decide to hedge that volume when the hedge was put in place on five nine only a week or so before the actual bill of lading date do you remember what was concerning us ybarbo paul you would hedge the purchase cost if you were going to be repaying borrowings and you liked the price you could lockin also as you say if you were concerned that prices during your sales period would not hold their value relative to the three days around bl yes we missed zero zero zero three gallon by hedging the part of the cargo that was sold in april and early may we were not particularly concerned about anything just wanted to be rid of the possibility that prices could have gone up a penny or two third it seems to me that on the may hedge the second part of the volume someone lost big time i could be wrong but what im looking at is the fix we got suzanne got in return for the floating the fix rate was much higher than the actual mbv figures for the months of june and july this assumes of course the enron didnt turn around and laid off that risk on someone else what i am trying to say is that there appears to have been something going on with the curve on or around five two one that changed dramatically once actual figures were recorded do you remember ybarbo paul lpg prices dropped dramatically in june going below zero three five per gallon normally no one in enron would get hurt because lee jackson would have hedged himself with someone outside of the company however he actually left his position open and lost about three zero zero k that does not impact us fourth it seems to me that your swaps were being built around a primary objective beyond risk protection to deliver approximately five cents per gallon margin to miguel anytime we have that opportunity we should grab it ybarbo paul yes i want to lock the margin but if possible i like to improve it to above the zero zero five thats all for now ill keep studying this what i am trying to do is draw some conclusions as to the circumstances under which we will want to swap the purchase cost its clear to me that most of the times once you know what your cost is you will try to lock in your margin by doing a swap using your revenue stream ie the mbv basis thanks again for all your time and patience mariella,12:33:59,No

billion more than three zero billion less than predicted just weeks ago and less than half the estimate made when the administration released its budget this spring expectations for the surplus plummeted as the economy stalled this year and worsened further in the wake of the sept one one terrorist attacks circumstances have changed radically omb director daniels acknowledged in a statement today we must make sure that this is not the last surplus by limiting additional spending to purposes directly related to the nations battle against terrorism the fytwo zero zero zero surplus was two three seven billion making the fyzero one surplus the second largest on record the april omb budget estimate for the fyzero one surplus was two eight one billion the administrations mid session review

it continues to support allowing airport screeners to remain private workers with increased federal supervision backing away from a statement white house chief of staff card made over the weekend saying president bush probably would sign legislation that fully federalizes the workers if it came to his desk in that form that may or may not be the case white house press secretary ari fleischer said today when asked about cards statement fleischer said it was premature to speculate on whether bush would veto legislation federalizing airport workers the president continues to believe that the best way to guarantee safety is through a more flexible system where not everyone is on the federal payroll fleischer said bush continues to back legislation by house transportation and infrastructure chairman young that provides federal standards for airport workers but does not require that all become federal employees card told nbcs meet the press sunday that if bush received a bill federalizing airport security workers i suspect that he wouldnt want to sign it but he would he wants airline security house democrats appeared bolstered by cards comments and are hoping for a win on a democratic substitute that would federalize workers when the young bill comes up for a floor vote wednesday this shows that the white house position against making baggage screeners federal employees is rather soft said a spokesman for house transportation and infrastructure ranking member james oberstar dminn oberstar has introduced an alternative to youngs bill that would federalize workers like the senate bill but place them under the transportation department the senate bill places much of the oversight with the justice department democratic aides said that democrats are likely to offer the senate bill in order to move the legislation quickly the young bill goes before the rules committee tuesday by keith koffler and april fulton finance house may not accept senate terrorism insurance plan house members may be playing catch up on federal terrorism insurance this week after an agreement was reached late friday between key senators lawmakers and the bush administration on the bills rough outline senate banking committee members are expected this week to introduce the legislation which would have the insurance industry financing the first one zero billion in payments following a future terrorist attack after that taxpayers would foot somewhere between seven zero percent and nine zero percent of the costs meanwhile members of the house financial services committee who have been a more difficult sell are still in the discovery phase of the process but in striking a deal with such influential and ideologically disparate members as senate banking chairman sarbanes ranking member phil gramm rtexas and sen christopher dodd dconn the white house may have found a way to effectively circumvent a house debate sources said i dont see how and where the house plays into that mix one observer said at the same time the observer added consideration needs to be given to house financial services chairman oxley and probably some of the democrats they shouldnt be cut out of the picture house members were prepared to dig in on the subject with a roundtable discussion organized for wednesday by financial services capital markets subcommittee chairman richard baker r la criticism and caution about a federal terrorism insurance backstop has been most pronounced and most bipartisan among members of the house committee baker has been especially vocal about the need to ensure the industry does not get something for nothing while democrats raised the specter that federal dollars would open the door for federal regulation of the insurance industry i think in general theres an appreciation of what the senates put together so far a baker spokesman said today however the house roundtable should be taking up several other questions house members have the spokesman added while the senate proposal looks like a good start for the shortterm question the final legislative package may need to go a bit further specifically in addressing whether there is going to be any repayment by the industry once it finds its footing he said an oxley spokeswoman added our concerns remain the same as they were last week i think we want to stand firm in defense of the taxpayer and in a way that encourages the private sector to provide as much terrorism coverage as possible sources said they believe the final senate bill could include modest language probably crafted by sen jon corzine dnj requiring some repayment from the insurance industry in return for federal aid corzines staff could not be reached for comment as for the substance of the senatewhite house proposal frank torres of consumers union said the details remain to be seen were encouraged that the first dollar losses are going to be picked up by the industry torres said however he added the senate plan calls for a one zero billion threshold that sounds low to him given that the industry has some three zero zero billion in reserves moreover we understand the legitimate need for some federal assurances but it is turning out to be a subsidy torres said nobodys talked about the impact of insurance rates on taxpayers the government will be there to help out but why cant we have it in some form of loan guarantee we think the house folks are asking all the right questions torres added as for the position of house republican leaders our sense is that they do not want a big bailout bakers spokesman said leadership wants the bill to be something free market conservatives can feel proud about he said by pamela barnett trade english predicts congress will restore trade authority rep phil english rpa a member of the house ways and means committee predicted that the restoration of presidential trade negotiating authority will be voted on and probably approved by the house in the next few weeks he added that it is reasonable that the president will have the authority again by the end of the year speaking at a forum on trade sponsored by the us chamber of commerce english endorsed a measure to renew trade authority authored by ways and means chairman thomas he said the thomas bill was the strongest one i have seen since ive been in congress with regard to promoting higher labor and environmental standards and also preserving the consultative role of congress the thomas bill borrows heavily from a free trade agreement concluded recently between the united states and jordan english emphasized that the thomas bill calls on countries to be on the record as being willing to enforce their standards english said thomas bill gives the united states flexibility to negotiate trade pacts based on the particular circumstance of various countries meanwhile president bush today announced the creation of a two zero zero million overseas private investment corporation support facility to provide us corporations access to loans guarantees and political risk insurance for investment projects in sub saharan africa speaking to a forum on the african growth and opportunity act a free trade agreement between the united states and african nations bush said the united states would also establish a regional office in johannesburg south africa to coordinate trade issues between the united states and africa the president also announced one five million in seed funding to launch the trade for african development and enterprise program which will establish regional hubs to help african businesses take advantage of the african growth and opportunity act by stephen norton and keith koffler agriculture dorgan pushes for farm bill approval by years end sen byron dorgan dnd told congressdaily friday that if the senate agriculture committee does not soon succeed in sending a farm bill to the floor senate majority leader daschle could bring up the housepassed bill for amendment dorgan said he was not suggesting that daschle bring up the bill because he believes the responsible thing for the senate agriculture committee to do is come to an agreement on it however dorgan said he so strongly believes congress should pass the farm bill this year that he did not rule out that option dorgan who does not sit on the senate agriculture committee appear to signal the frustration noncommittee democrats feel toward the senate agriculture committees lack of progress on the bill one capitol hill source working on the bill said democrats are splintered in trying to satisfy democrats from different regions the source said senate agriculture chairman harkins staff is circulating his concept paper which he may publicly release this week the source said among other democratic committee members while quietly sounding out republican staffers who work for republican senate agriculture committee members other than senate agriculture ranking member richard lugar rind who has released his own proposal with dramatic farm program changes when the house sent its farm bill to the senate daschle did not assign it to a committee which left him the option of bringing it up on the senate floor daschle staffers have said the majority leader wants the senate agriculture committee to write a bill that is better than the house bill but they also left the option of bringing up the house bill and amending it one problem with the house farm bill dorgan said is that it does not treat wheat farmers well but he called it a step forward compared to current law on friday dorgan wrote harkin and lugar saying they should finish the bill this year and pointed out how in his view the house bill shortchanges wheat and barley growers dorgan said his letter reflected meetings he held last week with both daschle and harkin meanwhile the national association of wheat growers friday issued a new call for completion of the farm bill this year saying the uncertainty is causing problems for winter wheat farmers who are planting crops now our agriculture lenders are increasingly nervous about committing themselves to farm loans in light of an uncertain farm policy environment we need these loans now for the operating capital on our two zero zero two crop nawg chief executive officer daren coppock said in what appeared to be a response to dorgans letter corn soybean and livestock groups wrote daschle saying they were so satisfied with the bush administrations promises of funding that action could wait until next year but cotton and rice growers and the american farm bureau federation and the national farmers union declined to sign the letter to daschle and are still pushing for the bill this year by jerry hagstrom agriculture administration backs away from lugar farm plan the bush administration is distancing itself from the farm bill proposed by senate agriculture ranking member richard lugar rind although there are many similarities between the bush administrations recently issued farm policy guidelines and lugars proposal on food stamps and other nutrition programs agriculture undersecretary for nutrition and consumer services eric bost told congressdaily friday this is the first inning of a nine inning ball game when lugar issued his farm bill on oct one eight he said he had the full backing of the administration with agriculture secretary veneman even issuing a statement that praised his proposal but the lugar proposal has not won support from any major farm groups and rumors continue swirling that farm groups told white house officials they were offended by its support of the lugar proposal bost told the associated press the administration supports lugars plan to restore food stamp benefits to legal immigrants who have been in the country for five years or worked for four years bost said friday that the four zero quarters of work requirement for food stamp eligibility is something that we feel comfortable supporting however we are continuing to work at it we dont want to say that is where the administration is bost then dismissed those who would pigeonhole him on the issue reporters want to box me in on the issue we are continuing to look at additional options for food stamp eligibility bost said the options could be narrower or broader bost also pointed out the administration is continuing to discuss the nutrition title of any new farm bill with congressional leaders and omb and noted that last week he offered assistance in writing the nutrition title bost said he doesnt have an opinion at the present time about making the womens infants and childrens program mandatory rather than discretionary funding another issue raised in the usda policy book by jerry hagstrom congressional operations house awaits remediation results on longworth ford although the search for anthrax contamination continued to hamper normal house operations today officials are nearing the end of their efforts to detect and destroy any harmful bacteria the longworth and ford house office buildings where anthrax has been detected remain closed but a spokesman for house administration chairman ney said health officials have completed remediation and are waiting on test results to confirm that any trace of anthrax has been destroyed the ney spokesman said that tunnels connecting the capitol and the rayburn and cannon house offices buildings have been reopened but entrances to longworth are blocked off and sealed anthrax was discovered friday in the longworth offices of reps john baldacci dmaine rush holt d nj and mike pence rind a conference call for chiefs of staff and district directors of legislators with longworth offices is scheduled for this afternoon meanwhile senate aides said leaders have still not decided what method to employ in order to eliminate anthrax from the hart senate office building as health officials from various federal agencies advise congressional officials epa administrator whitman had been invited to brief senators today about cleanup efforts in the capitol complex but the event was cancelled the hart building remains closed as staff who work in the building make preparations for what could be a prolonged dislocation by mark wegner and geoff earle judiciary court to decide on federal authority over drug mixing the supreme court today agreed to decide if the government can regulate the mixing of drugs at local pharmacies the bush administration had urged the court to take the case arguing there were serious health implications in allowing unregulated drugmixing the government has wide inspection authority over drugmakers in their plants but this case involves pharmacies that dilute or alter prescription drugs to make them easier to consume or for use by a child or someone with allergies congress changed guidelines for compounding in one nine nine seven and the government was sued in nevada by pharmacies that frequently mix drugs the fda contends it can regulate companies that advertise mixing services or have sales personnel the court also rejected a constitutional challenge to congressional salary increases dating back a decade justices refused to reinstate a lawsuit filed by rep bob schaffer r colo seeking to block yearly costofliving adjustments for congress the latest increase earlier this month bumped up congressional salaries to about one five zero zero zero zero schaffer contends the increases violate the two seven th amendment which forbids members of congress from increasing their salary during their term congress can block the adjustments which it has done five times in the last eight years the court was told the court also agreed today to hear the case of a man who wanted an oil refinery job his own doctor said could kill him the associated press reported mario echazabal sued chevron corp under the americans with disabilities act claiming he should have gotten the job despite a chronic case of hepatitis c doctors who examined echazabal said exposure to chemicals at the refinery would speed the deterioration of echazabals liver and that a large exposure from a plant fire or other emergency could kill him chevron appealed to the supreme court arguing that echazabals medical condition puts him outside the protection of the americans with disabilities act the federal antibias law mandates equal treatment for qualified workers no matter their disability a court decision in the case could help clarify what duty an employer has to potential employees with disabilities politics white house to consider proposals designed to limit liability an administration official friday confirmed reports that the white house will consider proposals designed to limit the liability of businesses affected by the sept one one terrorist attacks owners and architects of buildings destroyed by the attacks manufacturers of airplane components and others could be sued as a result of the attacks we are open to proposals that would treat all companies that would be sued similarly to each other the administration official said the white house believes that such proposals would be fair since caps on claims against one industry the airlines are already in place and lawsuits that would have been directed at air carriers may now end up in the lap of other businesses the white house also believes that protection for other industries is needed to prevent some businesses from entering into bankruptcy and thereby ensure plaintiffs could recover damages if a deal with congress is reached on the issue the white house would be open to adding the initiative onto legislation helping reinsurers provide coverage to insurance companies writing policies protecting businesses against future terrorist attacks the official added politics cook to run as a republican former rep merrill cook rutah has decided to run as a republican for the seat he lost last year satisfying republicans who feared his plan to campaign as an independent would split the gop vote the associated press reported cook in announcing his change of heart saturday said he did not want to be blamed for possibly helping democratic rep jim matheson win a second term i dont want to be called a spoiler i want to carry on with the important issues cook said cook said he was inspired to run again after comments tuesday by national republican congressional committee chairman tom davis of virginia who said he hoped cook would not run and that a republican should win the redrawn two nd district if we can find a decent candidate cook was enraged by davis comments and then issued his threat to run as an independent but cook said he spoke with davis on the phone later in the week and was assured that davis would stop saying negative things about him and show neutrality in the utah republican partys nominating process attack update us warplanes hit an area of caves and tunnels in eastern afghanistan today known as a hideout of osama bin laden killing two people reuters reported frustrated at weeks of us bombing that have failed to budge taliban front lines afghanistans opposition forces plotted what they said today would be a major push on a vital talibanheld northern stronghold the associated press reported to bring it off a spokesman of the northern alliance stressed we will need american help afghan opposition forces are complaining increasingly that us bombing to date is too light to drive out taliban forces defending kabul and the northern city of mazaresharif us strategy has focused on selective strikes on taliban positions and those of bin ladens alqaida network rather than mass bombing meanwhile sen phil gramm rtexas said saturday death is the only justice for anyone found responsible for aiding the sept one one terrorist attacks im interested in hunting down these people and bringing them to justice and thats killing them he told a gop leadership training seminar in dallas gramm who is retiring at the end of his current term praised the leadership of bush who has said he wants bin laden dead or alive gramm offered his own homespun directive we have an old texas rangers principle that if you ride with thieves you die with thieves the modern incantation is if you ride with terrorists you die with terrorists the final word they

five zero one dfive a first discussions with montana power are starting to progress quickly they have proposed we sign a two week exclusivity agreement with them on the turbine and have agreed to pay us two zero zero k unlike the exclusive with northwestern this agreement will not be binding as to ultimate purchase terms it will simply provide that we dont talk to anybody else during the exclusivity period the target price for a deal with montana which they have indicated is acceptable is two nine million less the continuing payment obligations to westinghouse if this deal is consummated at two nine million the gross margin to enron corp should be approximately one million with this in mind we have approached westinghouse about resolving the dispute on the damaged generator because a replacement generator is on order essentially the issue is who as between enron and westinghouse bears collection risk on the insurance claim associated with the generator we have proposed that we split the risk and specifically that enron pay one five million for the replacement generator with insurance proceeds split five zero five zero with westinghouse up to the point of recovery of our one five million we would also waive our ld claim as part of this deal in order to do the montana power deal we need to resolve this generator claim chris kay and i support this approach for a few reasons first it generates income for the company second lets just say the handling of the claim by the former eecc was not stellar and the contract provided for us to manage the insurance on the unit third while we may have a good claim for lds under the turbine contract we may have to move into litigation mode to collect them we of course want to solicit input from both of you before we proceed too far with either montana or westinghouse because of this we have written the exclusivity agreement with montana to provide that if we cannot deliver the generator we will return the exclusivity payment the last complication as if we didnt have enough is that the transfer price deal with calme is not finalized louise has taken this on and is talking to them to get the deal that janet and i proposed earlier done which essentially provides that calme eat two million of carrying costs associated with the period during which they had responsibility for the turbine please see the emails from louise below please let us know if you are on board with our approach as regards montana and westinghouse and i will then follow up with louise on her discussions with calme thanks and regards ben forwarded by ben jacobyhouect on zero three three one two zero zero one zero eight one six am enron north america corp from ben f jacoby zero three two eight two zero zero one

rules will continue to be capitalized through the last payment date under the turbine contract two at this time the turbine value is undetermined while we have identified one potential counterparty montana power we do not have a signed deal in addition we are in the middle of a contract dispute with westinghouse regarding the damaged generator while we hope to resolve this dispute in the context of our exiting the turbine position there exists the potential of this going into litigation three janet and i proposed the deal i discussed with you to calme in december but never got a formal response i have put in several calls to elio tortolero at calme but have not heard from him for about a month he advised me at that time that he would get me a counter proposal my group has had de facto management responsibility for the unit since december four this unit was initially an ena unit but was taken by calme david haug i believe in december nine nine for projects they were

raised it to the attention of my clients twice in the last two months however now that it is moving they have got the message williams kern river is going to host a meeting today to create a coalition to oppose the bill bev hansen knows where the meeting will take place in addition to williams i understand that questar wspa and other retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill my client wild goose will also be listed in opposition but they dont carry that much clout or name recognition so far i am hopeful that other groups will surface soon as for the bill itself the problem is two fold first the cpuc decides what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities they take input from customers but loretta is a command and control type all the way and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a goldplated stateregulated system while the bill does not and cannot legally bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates the large customers have to commit to take firm service on a five year basis with exit fees if they dont take this they can only get interruptible service from the utilities many if not all large customers especially generators cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the ldc system this is the same dilemma that the rls tariff caused my belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to reinstitute the rls tariff or an onerous peaking rate the commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm five year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate my view is based on sempras reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by lynchs office this could interfere with enron gas sales over the interstates and would certainly threaten any transwestern plans for building across the border into california although that does not appear to be a high priority at this time this bill will also make it more costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of their needs please call if you have further questions mike day

mike i understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on behalf of questar do we know if the other pipelines have been active in any discussions on this bill what about the generators have then been involved since presumably their in need of lots more capacity and theyre referenced in the bill what about large customers they been screaming for more infrastructure too and many have blamed socalgas and the puc for not delivering it do we know if pipelines generators large customers are supporting or opposing the bill ill try to check around too in between the electric mayhem there doesnt seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates from building into the state if thats true wouldnt the puc take those projects into account when doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct and noncore to take capacity that isnt already being met by others ie interstates bringing pipe into the state any info you can provide on these fronts would

columnist originally posted at five two three pm et five nine zero one on realmoneycom a small research boutique with a reputation for rigorous analysis is telling clients to quickly dump enron enenyse news believing that the energy trading giants two zero zero one earnings will fall well short of wall streets forecasts cambridge massbased off wall street led by analyst mark roberts thinks enrons two zero zero one earnings will fall six cents short of the consensus estimate of one seven nine the firm also believes enron stock should trade around three zero nearly five zero below wednesdays five nine two zero the firms two six page report published may six highlights enrons declining profitability and increasing leverage and suggests that the company should trade on the same sort of multiple as a trading firm like goldman sachs gs nyse news which has a two zero zero one pricetoearnings ratio about half of enrons three three times ows also alleges that enrons earnings quality is poor and that key parts of its financial statements are confusing and opaque houstonbased enron didnt comment by publication time on elements of the report that detox sent the company an energy analyst who is bullish on enrons outlook says the ows report contains fundamental misunderstandings about the energy market and enrons business model but he says the report does include some groundbreaking and valid insights the analysts firm doesnt give stock recommendations economies of scale why care what off wall street writes compared with say analysts at merrill lynch mernyse news for one ows has an excellent track record particularly sweet was two zero zero zero when the tech stocks it had bashed came crashing down it has also shown itself to be well ahead of the curve recommending that clients sell etailer pricelinecom pclnnasdaq news in june one nine nine nine when faith in internet stocks was at its blindest and their prices at their most insane pulling back enron retreats after long rally enron with its domination of a burgeoning energy market annual revenue of over one zero zero billion and impressive earnings growth can hardly be ranked alongside the likes of priceline but ows thinks enron is set for a precipitous drop nonetheless why owss main beef is that key profitability measures are in decline margins on enrons pretax operating earnings which the companys earnings releases call ibit or income before interest taxes and other items are falling total ibit of seven nine five million in the first quarter amounted to only one five nine of the five zero billion in revenue for the period compared with a two zero eight margin in the fourth quarter and four seven five in the yearearlier period revenue in the first quarter was nearly quadrupled from the yearearlier period yet ibit rose only two seven this shrinkage is due to lowermargin trading income making up an increasingly large share of enrons revenue base ows thus calculates that for the remainder of two zero zero one enron needs to generate an extra two one billion in revenue for each additional penny it makes over its two zero zero zero eps of one four seven to reach analysts expectation of one seven nine the energy analyst counters that ows apparently hasnt grasped how enron can continue to increase earnings even when margins shrink it does so simply by increasing volumes as the energy market balloons in size in other words margins may decline but since revenues are so much higher earnings still go up illustrating this firstquarter two zero zero one eps of four nine cents was two three ahead of the yearago figure even though the ibit margin shrank by three two percentage points the analyst thinks enron will make one eight two per share in two zero zero one growing on you in addition the huge growth in the energy market that has so helped enron is likely to continue for several years according to the analyst he notes that roughly seven five of the electricity available in the us still isnt traded in a market eventually it will be part of a competitive environment but itll take five to one zero years says the analyst and he believes the extreme volatility in energyrelated commodities that has also benefited enron will exist for longer than ows projects still owss point on profitability is bolstered by other profit measures return on capital net income as a percentage of equity plus debt was six six in two zero zero zero down on one nine nine nine s six nine and well below the two zero zero zero returns on capital at duke duknyse news one one eight dynegy dynnyse news one two one and even goldman eight nine even enron bulls will admit that its financials are hard to follow for example it doesnt give a gross margin number for its wholesale services or trading business which accounts for nine six of revenue but one area of the companys financial statements registered with the securities and exchange commission that consistently bugs analysts is the part that describes enrons related party transactions which are the deals it does with entities that have some sort of link to the firm in fact one of the related entities that enron has traded with is headed by enrons cfo andrew fastow the energy analyst comments why are they doing this its just inappropriate the reason for maintaining these hardtofollow related party deals has been a source of speculation but ows analysis shows how a sales of optical fiber to a related party may have been used to goose earnings in the second quarter of two zero zero zero estimated profits from the socalled dark fiber optical cable without the gear to send data over it transaction allowed enron to beat analysts secondearnings earnings estimate by two cents a share rather than missing by two cents how soon before wall street follows off wall street on enron,05:11:00,No

the recommendation letters jim i was thinking that since i do not have enough time to prepare the appplication process it would be a good idea for me to fax the recommendation letter forms to you first so you know what to expect and maybe start writing in the meantime i will mail those forms as well as envelopes because you have to retunrn those to me the envelopes would have to be signed

contact the other finance guys here who knows they may have some great leads as far as the letter is concerned i would be happy to do it generally however each grad school has a specific recommendation form that they want references to fill out so let me know after you get the required info from the schools typically students just send it to me as i will probably have to submit it directly to the grad school people as they generally want confidential letters jim original message from causholli monika mailtomonikacaushollienroncom sent friday november one six two zero zero one one one three seven am to nielsen james cob subject re information from university of colorado jim i did write to eric hughson about the phd program and i am waiting for his response in the meantime can you write me a recommendation letter i know you dont like to do this but if you would it would be great i am planning to apply to about three four schools for now i will mail the paperwork to you on monday also should i contact the other finance professors at osu trying to see what they can help me with thanks for all your help i will keep you posted monika original message from nielsen james

heard from my former professor if i were you i would contact eric hughson about cus phd program in finance it is worth a try i will contact you if i hear about other opportunities either for graduate study or employment opportunities keep me posted jim original message from ron melicher mailtoronaldmelichercoloradoedu sent friday november one six two zero zero one one zero one eight am to nielsen james cob subject re hello old friend hi jim it has been a long time between communications we no longer offer an ms in finance however i believe the denver campus does we admit only one or two new students in the finance phd program each yearthus it is very competitive our finance phd program coordinator is eric hughson and he could be contacted at erichughsoncoloradoedu unfortunately i dont have any specific recommendations ron psi also still like the teaching part of the academic life and probably wont be retiring for another few years original message from nielsen james cob mailtonielsenjbusorstedu sent thursday november one five two zero zero one two four nine pm to ronaldmelichercoloradoedu subject hello old friend hi ron it certainly has been a long time since we have communicated i am glad to see that you have not yet retired and either have i moreover i dont have any plans to do so in the immediate future as this job is so much fun the reason i am writing is that a former student of mine from albania who works for enron has been thinking for some time that she would like to go back to school and get a masters degree in finance or phd being a foreign student she needs to get some sort of scholarship or assistantship she graduated from osu a year or so ago and has been working at enron since that time given what is happening at enron i am not surprised that she has decided to go back for a graduate degree our college of business does not have any graduate student assistantships and we also dont offer a master degree in finance or phd monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest students i have had in recent years she is incredibly bright and works very hard does cu still offer the masters degree in finance and still offer student assistantships if i recall george carvel was working on a ms in finance and had an assistantship under maurice unger when i was going to cu if so can i give monika your name and have her contact and perhaps forward her resume to you or can you put her in touch with the right person at cu if cu does not have anything available do you know of a few schools who might so that i can pass the

 DCA, and PSC",chris jensen executive director of the florida energy pipeline association has learned from some dep agency contacts that the alliance operating behind the front organization known as friends of the aquifer inc has decided to drop their lawsuits appealing the denials of their petitions to more severely regulate pipelines in florida while this is good news for those of us fighting the war here in florida the reason for this withdrawal of their appeals of failed efforts on three different petitions at the state level in florida is because of their belief that their current activity at the federal level holds greater promise of success and their desire to concentrate their resources in that effort my thoughts on this is that the pipeline industry should get organized and execute a full court press defense which is proactive as we move into increased future efforts at the federal level by the alliance through their other front organizations these organizations have been created to burden pipeline competition to benefit the maritime interests from my vantage point i am limited to mostly what i see in the press but these front organization are winning the battle in the national press that i have seen and heard aopl and ingaa do not come across in the press as being equipped or prepared to handle the shaping of the pipeline safety issues in the press that these alliance front organizations have been doing our enron government affairs folks in washington are knowledgeable experienced and capable they have been through this battle and other battles in the past so this is not a criticism but just a friendly observation from a remote vantage point that if the entire pipeline industry does not develop a proactive plan to shape the issues in the national media during the next year we will find it very difficult or perhaps impossible to come out of congress with legislation that is reasonable and workable from a safety regulation perspective it has been my experience with the alliance in the past that to any extent they are successful they will then multiply their efforts and broaden their field of attack the issue is not safety of pipelines but competition for the transportation of energy we have an industry that can be very proud of its record of safety economic benefits reliability public service energy efficiency and environmentally favorable service when compared to any other mode of transporting energy we have learned from our experiences research and mistakes in the past and will continue to learn in the future so that future pipeline service will be even better for our people whom we serve our entire energy pipeline industry natural gas and petroleum needs to shape the issues in the national press and tell our very good story so the politicians are not overrun with public opinion shaped by our maritime competition thanks for your interest this is a headsup that is probably not needed but i felt that there might be something in it that would help with a very difficult current and future issue,09:29:00,No

 (EDIDE)",hi sara with all due respect sara i have a constructive suggestion for both of us in annas view and i agree it is causing some unnecessary confusion that you call her to negotiate provisions of the contract that i am negotiating with her without my knowledge it makes both you and i look disorganized and in doing so i beleive it undermines our position in negotiating the terms as a practical matter it is extrmemly difficult to negotiate a contract and administratively organize the execution if i am not sure whether there is someone else taking steps especially with outside counsel that i am not aware of if you have asked me to negotiate an agreement as in the case of enron credit inc and you have an update on the status having sat in on the conference call on friday then why not let me do so at the very least could you call me first for an update or try to include me in the call equally important while i am sure that it is not your intent you are undermining my morale i have constantly kept you updated sometimes on an hourly basis on the status of what is going on with all of the administrative and legal tasks to call outside counsel under those circumstances comes across as a vote of no confidence in my work and efforts which is baffling to me because i think i have worked hard and have accomplished a tremendous amount with respect to the brokerage agreement project i have negotiated these agreements with a great deal of thoughtfulness and skill i have gone above and beyond even to determine applicable law that no one else was aware of moreover on friday again without intending to do so you undermined my morale by telling me that there were administrative tasks that needed to be done you said that you hope i know that the agreement does not just become executed once we sign it sara it should be obvious to you that i know perhaps better than anyone else what administrative tasks need to be accomplished to open this kind of brokerage account i have even figured out that there are administrative tasks beyond what any one else is aware for example in the case of the ancillary nasdaq agreements that no one else was aware had to be completed i have proven already that i can execute all of the administrative tasks in an expedited manner i want these comments to be taken in the spirit in which they are given which is that we both mean well and are working toward a common goal and that everyone can learn from anyone i look forward to talking to you further so that we do not let the frantic nature of our work make any one feel that their efforts are not valued cheryl nelson senior counsel ebthree eight one six seven one three three four five four six nine three,04:37:00,No

meeting today with gerry to discuss the sba priority during allocations some of the following issues came up gerry correct me if i misunderstood anything if we ever call an sba to bring in gas after the timely cycle do we still want them to have priority over alternate and interruptible my opinion is no they should only have this priority during the timely cycle if the sbas bring in gas at a secondary point do we still want them to have priority over alternate and interruptible my opinion is no they should only have this priority at primary points are we aware that an alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get squeezed out of the same entitlement on a day that an sba shipper is given priority over alternate might have some mad shippers how will sba volumes be posted on the ebb if there is an allocation interruptible because the current methodology for allocation is based on a point they dont follow the downstream will the it contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as sba it this is for the future contracts system should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the sbas such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria reyna cabrera seven one three eight five three three zero seven two,10:36:16,No

department of energy predeparture briefing w asst secy goldwyn mac i have a slightly different view on your point four the israelis are actually pushing for a palestinian water project as it will greatly strengthen the israeli position in the land settlement discussions in the peace talks the pna is saying that they need more land in the west bank in order to gain more access to aquifers under the land the isaelis want a desal project for the pna so that they can claim that the pna has a larger water base and thus does not need to have more land for access to more water the issue is that there is not practical way in which gaza generated water can efficiently reach the west bank thus a water project in gaza should really be a moot point in this discussion although it will not be due to the lack of rationale to their discussions i think that it is worth pointing out that the us consulate and embassy in israel have been helpful to us from the macro level there needs to be more proactive cooperation between the pna and goi on this project due to the logistical and technical reasons that mac pointed out below furthermore it it worth noting that the pna need to be more willing to adapt their standards to be more in line with large international transactions as the local process that they wish to cling to is very cumbersome and will not benefit the pna by attracting large scale foreign investment please let me know if you wish to discuss this further andrew enron international from mac mcclelland zero two zero nine two zero zero zero one zero five five am to mark

energy predeparture briefing w asst secy goldwyn the ipp in gaza is progressing albeit somewhat behind schedule this combined cycle power plant is the first infrastructure development project in gaza and the first by a major western company anywhere in palestine there are several issues which should be addressed and may be raised during the secretarys visit one all equipment for the plant must transit israel we have been assured by the israelis that movement of the equipment will not be impeded as long as it is on the list of equipment we provide them that said there are countless opportunities for equipment to be delayed in israel awaiting clearance whether on the list or not first power could be delayed indefinitely if the israelis choose to do so for political security or other reasons two fuel for the plant once operational will also transit israel again disruption of the fuel supply for any length of time will in effect pull the plug on power in gaza gas from egypt has been discussed it remains to be seen if that will be a reality anytime soon three although not officially from the israeli government we have been told that as soon as the first watt of power from the plant is produced the israelis will turn off supply of electricity to gaza the current consumption is about one one zero mw the first phase of the plant will produce four zero mw this appears to be the beginning of a power supply arrangement whereby israel sells gaza electricity to make up the difference that electricity is likely to be more expensive than that which the plant will supply enron could well end up being blamed for the higher cost four water is another critical issue the palestinians want their own supply of fresh water which must necessarily be desalinated israel is currently selling water to gaza it is not in israels best interest to lose this customer therefore she may attempt to delay a desalination project five opic project funding is problematical since they originally invited enron to take on this project they should necessarily also be involved lack of opic support could jeopardize other project financing and drive up costs six the israelis must also approve the environmental impact of the plant the plant will meet or exceed world bank guidelines more so when operating on gas while not a probem at this point the israelis could delay constructionoperation over environmental concerns andrew is the lead developer for this project and may have other issues for consideration thanks mac forwarded by mac mcclellandenron_development on

crisis is for you to initiate action under section two zero one rockefeller said may one six he also plans to introduce broader legislation may one seven aimed at providing relief to the us steel industry he did not rule out eventually attaching the measure to the tax bill now working its way through congress but said let me get it introduced first bush nominee notes possible action earlier may one six president bushs nominee for a deputy us trade representative slot peter allgeier said at a confirmation hearing of the senate finance committee that the bush administration was looking very very seriously at possible action under section two zero one i would like to assure you that the administration is looking very very seriously at the issue of a possible two zero one as part of our response to a very urgent problem allgeier said us trade representative robert b zoellick has provided members of congress with similar assurances on several occasions since taking office earlier this year on may one zero for instance he told a house appropriations subcommittee that a decision on possible section two zero one safeguard action should be made within a matter of months or sooner for his part sen charles f grassley riowa who chairs the committee said he would be reluctant to support committee action on the issue i would be reluctant to do that he said i think our committee ought to be seen as honest brokers in that effort grassley told reporters he has been approached by outside interests that have urged him to back a committee request to the itc on steel imports my message to them has been to work through the administration or file your own private action he said sen orrin g hatch rutah ranking republican on the committee said he would probably support rockefellers plan for the committee to selfinitiate action under section two zero one i dont want to be unfair to other countries hatch told reporters but i sure as heck dont want them to be unfair to us either i want the administration to be on notice that were watching them senate letter on ad cvd laws grassley meanwhile told reporters he did not sign the letter from six one senators to president bush earlier this month saying they will oppose any international trade agreement that would weaken us laws aimed at protecting the us market from unfair imports or unexpected import surges because a worldwide discussion of antidumping practices for instance would benefit the united states more than it would benefit other countries he said he opposes efforts being made by some members of congress to require the bush administration to ensure that us antidumping and countervailing duty laws were off the table in multilateral trade negotiations under the world trade organization i dont think we have anything to fear having it on the table grassley said some countries such as south korea and japan argue that us trade laws have been used for protectionist purposes and have proposed revisiting the issue in the wto allgeier meanwhile said that us trade laws actually promote trade liberalization american manufacturers farmers and workers will feel more confident with trade negotiations if they feel that they have recourse to address these unfair trade practices by our trading partners he said and so we do not have any intention of weakening us trade remedy laws in our negotiations allgeier said that the united states cannot prevent other countries from bringing up the issue in trade talks little progress made on tpa grassley also told reporters may one six he hopes that the senate finance committee will be able to consider and approve legislation next month to renew the presidents trade promotion authority formerly known as fast track but he said that little progress has been made in discussions between his staff and the staff of sen max s baucus dmont the ranking democrat on the committee particularly concerning the contentious issue of labor and environmental protection in the context of trade agreements our staffs have been talking on a very regular basis grassley said but thats not to say that theres been progress made he said however he was still hopeful that the legislation could be cleared by the end of june then approved by the full senate before the next ministerial meeting of the world trade organization scheduled to be held in qatar nov nine one three also testifying at the finance committee hearing on may one six president bushs nominee for us ambassador to the wto linnet f deily said that if confirmed she plans to begin meeting immediately with representatives of other wto member countries in geneva hoping to build relationships based on trust and candor i look forward to working with other wto members to try and find common ground or reconcile our disparate positions while always representing the strength of the us position she said i would like to understand other perspectives while being a forceful advocate for our us

important i hope that you will delay sending your proposal out to others until we have a chance to fully evaluate your offer from goza stuart l sent monday january zero eight two zero zero one seven five two am to goza stuart l rogersherndonenroncom cc kevinmprestoenroncom elizabethsagerenroncom subject re epmi draft proposal answers to these questions will assist us in determining our position regarding your offer certain of the following information is drawn from historical data as to the plant nothing below is a representation as to the plants operability on a goingforward basis one why is the proposed guaranteed availability seven five so low in the nonsummer months at the quoted monthly demand charge epmi feels that the guaranteed availability values are competitive please note that seven five represents a guaranteed availability and actual availabilty will be targeted at a much higher level major maintenance would be completed during the nonsummer months two how do you propose that availability be calculated we propose that availability will be calculated using the following formula aaf pc d mpc where aaf actual availability factor for a given month p the number of peak hours in a given month where peak hours are he seven two two sunday through saturday ie seven days a week c the contracted quantity for that month in units of mws d the number of unit hours declared by epmi not available in the peak hours of that given month times the maximum contracted capacity of that unit m the number of mwhs called on by buyer in the peak hours of that given month but not delivered by seller for that month note both d and m would exclude the major maintenance outages see below scheduled outages see below outages due to force majeure buyers inability to perform including but not limited to nonavailability of gas andor gas transport and epmis inability to operate the plant due to legal regulatory or permitting restrictions or other reasons beyond the reasonable control of epmi one major maintenance outages mo the seller would be allowed two five days per year per unit to conduct major maintenance mos would not count against the actual availability factor see calculation below seller may only schedule mos with at least a one zero day notice and only during the months of october november december march andor april two scheduled outages so the seller would be allowed seven two hrs per month per unit to conduct scheduled maintenance sos would not count against the actual availability factor see calculation below seller will make commercially reasonable efforts to schedule sos during nonpeak periods weekends and nights seller may only schedule sos with at least a two four hour notice note that the guaranteed availability factor gaf would be set at nine five for the summer months and seven five for the other months the contracted full demand charge fdc for any given month would be paid by the purchaser to the seller as long as the actual availability factor aaf is equal to or greater than the gaf nine five or seven five for that month for any month in which aaf falls below the gaf of nine five or seven five depending on the month the purchaser tva would pay the seller epmi a prorated amount of the fdc using the formula below this prorated amount is known as the reduced demand charge rdc notice that an aaf of five zero or less for any given month would result in a floor reduced demand charge of two kwmo for that month adc two fdc two gaf five zero aaf five zero as long as aaf is equal to or greater than five zero and less than or equal to the gaf either nine five or seven five adc two kw for months in which aaf is equal to or less than five zero adc fdc for months in which aaf is equal to or greater than the gaf where adc actual demand charge for a given month fdc full demand charge for a given month aaf actual availability factor as defined below this number is given as a whole number eg nine seven is nine seven gaf guaranteed availability factor nine five all percentages are rounded to the next highest whole number eg nine four seven becomes nine five nine four four becomes nine four two is the plant winterized that is can it run in the cold weather significant upgrades were made to the plant after the one nine nine nine calendar year to aid in winterization in general however even fully winterized plants tend to be less reliable in extremely cold weather it would be buyers responsibility to address natural gas availability and delivery concerns throughout the year including winter months three from a manpower standpoint is the plant available seven xtwo four for all months or are the certain periods of time when the plant is not staffed the plant is staffed or has members on ready recall seven xtwo four however in order to have full preparation time a three hour notice is required prior to dispatch dispatch outside mf peak hours five xone six he seven two two requires a five hour dispatch notice four what has been the historic availability of the plant by month using the formula above the actual availability factor aaf for the plant by month for calendar year two zero zero zero is shown below jan one zero zero feb nine nine mar one zero zero apr one zero zero may nine seven jun nine seven jul nine nine aug one zero zero sep one zero zero oct one zero zero nov one zero zero dec one zero zero note that approximate average per unit run hours during calendar year two zero zero zero was two one five hours five what type of gas transportation has been historically used interruptible or firm historically epmi has utilized both firm and interruptible gas transportation depending on availability six has the plant ever been unavailable due to the inability of fuel only once since plant construction this occurred during a runtime with minimal advance notice in general fuel availability is the responsibility of the buyer and is more readily available with greater advance notice note also that the plant was only minimally run during the most recent winter season due to noneconomic dispatch conditions therefore the availability of gas this past winter was not tested epmi is willing to discuss with buyer making the facility a dual fuel plant subject to permitting restrictions and operational parameters and effected at buyers expense seven am i correct in assuming that in the tolling type arrangement tva has exclusive use of the plant that is enron would not have access to the output unless tva specifically waives its rights epmi would not have access to specific units of the plant while those units were being dispatched by tva the plant has six units and four would be designated by unit number to tva for purposes of the tolling agreement epmi could call on units not being dispatched by tva from rogersherndonenroncomsmtprogersherndonenroncom sent thursday january zero four two zero zero one two two two pm to goza

a bid solicitation for the new albany tolling service we anticipate sending this proposal to interested parties by the middle of next week one one zero zero one in the event epmi and tva have not

removal of the existing line i will not here hazard a quess as to how many additional acres this will require but it could well be that same amount again as the lines are the same length the enron folks can determine the actual number for clep we need one five three acres while our take permit only requires us to post a letter of credit for one six five zero zero in lieu of immediate purchase as security to ensure we will follow through with the actual purchase i believe the actual cost of buying the credits will be higher perhaps three times that amount because the market for these

eott must move ahead to fulfill its obligation as per the mou and incidental take permit by copy of this email i am asking larry campbell to work with both of you to assist in the proper fulfillment of eotts obligation as promptly as possible it is also my understanding from what research i have been able to do that eott does have approximately one four to one five acres of credit at the north coles levee preserve you should verify the exact credit number and furnish the service with such verification that is acreage eott will not have to purchase in satisfying the obligation of the permit

approval randi mccormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to eott dated february one four two zero zero one from the us fish and wildlife service approving our project for participation in the kern water bank compensation bank and authorizing the water bank to extend their incidental take authority to you and your entire project under their master permit this is of course very good news the letter notes however that we still need to purchase compensation acreage both at north coles levee and at the kern water bank specifically we must do the following one contact cheryl harding of kern water bank to acquire two three one acres of compensation credits and to get included in their master permit and two get cheryl harding a letter from the coles levee ecosystem preserve mark poe of aera stating that we have purchased one five three acres of credits for north coles levee or that we have set aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased while i could make these contacts i do not believe that would be wise because as kenny can attest our past experience has been that whenever a lawyer contacts the water bank it prompts them to automatically get their lawyers involved and our experience has been that this only slows things down or worse my suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for one proposed contract for acquisition of two three one acres of compensation credits and two perperwork to include eott and its contractors in their master permit she should also be informed that while we have not yet purchased the one five three acres of ncl credits we will by the end of this week have a letter of credit posted as security as allowed under our state take permit to cover this amount of acreage ask whether a copy of this lc will suffice for her purposes or whether we will need to have the actual acreage purchased as this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new lines it is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed please call me if you have any questions or if you would like otherwise to discuss how to approach this issue thanks a lot

nine zero nine subject yesterdays sen hearing the senate energy committee met yesterday afternoon and passed two very important bills sb six x burtonbowen as amended would establish a state power and financing authority the measure passed on a partyline vote with no republican votes what makes sb six x interesting to iep members is that is provides financing through the authority for environmental improvements to existing powerplants three zero years or older iep testified in support of the bill if it was amended to bind authorityzero one s eminent domain powers senat or burton agreed and iep is currently drafting language on this issue similarly burton agreed to work with senator morrow on language that would limit the authority to only supplementing private power generation and not building power plants where they are not needed the amended version is attached sb three three x as amended would authorize the governor to enter into negotiations with the ious to purchase their transmission system the governorzero one s pla n would have to be approved by the legislature by only a majority vote if approved the treasurer would have the authority to issue revenue bonds to pay for the transmission system this measure also passed on a partyline vote iep submitted written opposition to the bill as introduced but will continue to voice its concern with the state being both a market participan t and owning the transmission system as the bill moves through the legislativ e process the amended version is not in print yet please contact me if you have any questions julee
