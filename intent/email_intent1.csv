specifically mentions the threatened lawsuit by arem as having caused the puc to drop its proposed order to ban direct access retroactively rush to beat directaccess purchase ban spurs fear by ed mendel staff writer september one two two zero zero one sacramento some utility customers mainly businesses are rushing to sign contracts with generators for cheaper power before regulators enact a longdelayed ban raising concern that costs may go up for the remaining customers the state plans to ban direct access contracts with generators to keep customers with utilities in order to help pay for power bought by the state since january those state purchases will be covered in part by a one two five billion bond paid off by ratepayers over one five years but many businesses which say they need cheaper power now to remain competitive are signing contracts to bypass the utilities before the public utilities commission bans directaccess pacts an action that could come as soon as tomorrow we have seen a significant increase in the last month said ed van herik a spokesman for san diego gas electric co he said the amount of the annual sdge power load shifted to directaccess contracts with generators increased from one zero percent at the end of july to one seven four percent at the end of last month allowing customers to shop around for cheaper power was the main promise of the states failed attempt to deregulate electricity but when the utilities ran up huge debts and could no longer borrow the state began buying power for utility customers in january to avoid harming the economy with a massive rate increase the state decided to spread out payment of the soaring cost of wholesale power by obtaining decadelong power contracts and issuing the one two five billion ratepayer bond now the state wants customers to remain with the utilities for two reasons paying their fair share of the statesubsidized power received earlier this year and preserving a ratepayer base large enough to pay off the longterm contracts and the bond the power provided by the state to utility customers looked like a bargain earlier this year when prices on the wholesale market skyrocketed while the state raised rates for the customers of pacific gas and electric co and southern california edison by about onethird the state has not raised rates for sdge customers but an increase averaging one two percent for sdge residential customers is on the puc agenda tomorrow along with several other actions that may be taken to pave the way for issuing the one two five billion ratepayer bond puc president loretta lynch said that before wholesale power prices began soaring last year about one six percent of the power provided by the three investorowned utilities was being bought through directaccess contracts by last march she said the amount dropped to one percent certainly the direct access tanked because the marketers dumped their customers back on the utilities when the price rose last year lynch said but as wholesale power prices dropped in june directaccess contracts began to look like a better deal and a number of customers have left the utilities to get cheaper power at southern california edison the number of customers with directaccess contracts grew from three two five four seven on june two one to three seven seven one eight by the end of last month an increase of five one seven one said steve hansen an edison spokesman now that the market has turned everyone is bailing as fast as they can said mike florio of the utility reform network a san franciscobased consumer group most of the electricity obtained through directaccess contracts in recent months apparently has been bought by businesses that use large amounts of electricity most of the providers which serve small customers have simply stopped doing business in the state said puc commissioner carl wood who with lynch outlined the pucs proposed actions at a capitol news conference late last month the puc delayed action to ban directaccess contracts waiting for the legislature to act on proposals that would have allowed businesses to bypass the utilities if they paid an exit fee to cover their share of statesubsidized power the ban on directaccess contracts originally proposed by the puc would have been retroactive to july one but the retroactive provision was reportedly dropped after a lawsuit was threatened by the alliance for retail energy markets a group of power marketers in the legislature a provision allowing utility customers to obtain directaccess contracts beginning in two zero zero three if they pay exit fees was added to the assembly version of a plan passed last week to keep edison from joining pge in bankruptcy the addition of the directaccess provision is one reason that the assembly version of the edison plan is supported by the california chamber of commerce but the assembly plan pushed by gov gray davis faces opposition in the senate senate president pro tempore john burton dsan francisco said the senate would send an edison bill back to the assembly after making it a lessegregious giveaway to the utility the main provision in the assembly plan would allow edison to eliminate most of its debt by issuing two nine billion in bonds that would be paid off by ratepayers the foundation for consumer and taxpayer rights a consumer group in santa monica calls the edison plan a bailout and is threatening to place a measure on the ballot that would ask voters to overturn the plan should it be approved by the legislature and governor and turn the san francisco consumer group says the assembly version of the edison rescue plan is more generous to the utility than a tougher plan approved by the senate in july and giving edison an additional one eight billion the consumer group also says the directaccess provision in the assemblys edison plan has major loopholes that would allow large customers to leave the utilities without paying their fair share of state power costs turn opposes the reintroduction of direct access because any savings that are claimed to occur are really nothing more than the

taken would clarify that only owners of the divested plants would be subject to the provisions in the bill several generators met with speier this week to plead their case with little affect the measure will go to the senate floor next and is expected to pass where this measure will find difficulties is in the assembly which will have already passed out ab eight x migden which accomplishes the same goals as sb three nine x chances are that the assembly eca committee would hold sb three nine x in deference to the committeezero one s position on ab eight x the same could be said for ab

their relationship to public policy objectives before she felt comfortable taking a vote she indicated a desire to continue discussions with stakeholders to address and clarify issues and concerns in the bill and bring it up for another hearin g and vote most likely next tuesday iep continues to seek support for the measure and add coauthors the senate energy committee also heard sb two eight x sherbattin which makes various changes to the siting process including many iepsponsored proposals so far this is the most comprehensive and positive siting bill introduced with the greatest chance of moving forward the bill passed ou t of the committee on a nine to zero vote even though most of the environmental community testified in opposition chris ellison and i are continuing to work with the

hong kong weather products there is one issue outstanding concerning our due diligence for hong kong it does not relate specifically to hong kong weather but rather whether we should revisit the decision to last month list a hong kong password application on the eol registration screen as i raised in my email last week the hong kong regulator sfc has issued internet trading guidelines that state that internet sites that target hong kong residents will be expected to comply with hk securities legislation under the hk protection of investors ordinance there are restrictions on making public offers regarding i securities and ii investment arrangements relating to property other than securities whilst it is difficult to see how a hk weather swap or any other product listed on eol would fall with in these definitions it is not beyond doubt that the sfc may want to investigate eol if they believe it is targeting offers to hong kong residents my concern is that if the sfc logged onto eol following the publicity surrounding the hk weather launch they will find a password application for hong kong residents the sfc could well take the view that a hk password application is evidence that eol is targeting hong kong again it is the act of making the offer not entering into the transaction that is the subject of the ordinance hence arrangements to restrict with whom we ultimately enter into password agreements or conduct trades may not be viewed as conclusive in determining to whom offers are being made l have had an opportunity to review a two seven september two zero zero zero advice that jonathan marsh obtained from allen overy hk in section two they raise similar concerns with regard to the protection of investors ordinance way forward i would recommend that the password application for hong kong immediately be removed from the list on the eol registration screen at least for the present the chance that this hk pa may invite the attention of the hk sfc needs to be recognised this possibility exists irrespective of the decision to list hk weather products clearly on a practical level a greater awareness in hk of eol generated by the launch of hk weather may be the catalyst that attracts sfc interest whilst our legal analysis has not identified any breach of hk legislation by eol i would prefer if we mitigated the risk of an sfc instigated dialogue on this point this would mean a hong kong resident would need to call up to get a password application if we wish to include on the parts of the eol site that are available to the public ie where no password is needed provisions that are unambiguously directed to hk residents then it would be prudent for us to talk to the sfc first i note allen overy also raised this as a possibility i recognise this is a judgment call on what is one of those grey areas but the prospect of publicity in hk for eol was the determining factor in concluding that this more conservative approach is warranted at present amita gosaliaect one three one one two zero zero zero zero seven zero four am to paul smithenron_developmentenron_development cc dale neunerhouectect jennifer deboisblanc

sullivans interpretation of behind the citygate production back in january noel bartlo told me these deals stayed with ces retail john singer believes the deals stay with him at enron if these deals stay with enron should they be at ees since they are behind the citygate or do they stay with enron to reduce the tco delivery to the citygates for ces this could be a can of worms colleen what is the contract interruption does the citygate production deals stay with enron if they stay with enron then does ces realize this are the producers receiving two payments one from enron and one from ces maybe this has already be discussed and decided but i havent heard the official word currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate delivery that ces needs the numbers that herndon ldc schedulers provide to enron are reduced by the production i think chris put these buysells in the system to appease john and keep the enron accounting system whole currently the market demand tickets in sitara are reduced by the citygate supply the pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to the market demand tickets but the market demand numbers need to be increased then you could eliminate the buysell tickets that chris germany has been creating however if this production gas is not enrons then enron is creating a lot of unnecessary work and

wade r pricehouectect subject re ces pool gas hey guys i wanted yall to see the below messages as well since these are tco deals im little confused now because wade had informed me that these were all deals behind the citygate that john singer had been doing and that ces retail was pulling gas directly from these points we found a few like this on cng last week the way we have been handling this is to show a buy from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buysell with ces retail chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to ces retail but right now hes priorities are just a bit different i guess why im a little confused on these is that when i pulled up the phoenix dominion it has the pool attached to the deal and not one of the cpas wade do you know whether deal one four two six six nine is pool or a citygate deal if its pool i dont know how we could have missed this all month because we would have had to nominate it in navigator joanie do you have any insight into

for power sold to the states cashstrapped utilities this summer and winter wall street analysts who attended a closeddoor meeting with the governor said it looks like the people he wants sharing the pain are the companies generating power sold to utilities said kevin boone a bond analyst with bear stearns co who attended the meeting in new york he wants to force them to take cents on the dollar that seems to be what his initial proposal will be pge corps pacific gas electric and edison internationals southern california edison the states largest utilities are near bankruptcy after accumulating more than one two billion in debt buying power from generators at soaring prices regulators have not let the utilities pass on most of their power buying debt to consumers davis said some generators have approached him with offers to accept less than full payment said michael worms a utility analyst with gerard klauer mattison co davis spoke to about three five analysts from wall street and energyresearch firms in new york in a meeting that was criticized by investors and analysts who were not allowed to attend no names mentioned davis didnt specify which companies came to him with partial payment proposals analysts said duke energy corp calpine corp willams cos dynegy inc and reliant energy inc are among the biggest suppliers of electricity to california utilities im not aware of him talking to anyone at duke about forgiveness duke energy spokesman tom williams said reliant spokesman richard wheatley said daviss proposal doesnt really come as a surprise because politicians in sacramento the capital of california have been discussing the idea for weeks reliant has opposed anything other than full payment of its debts williams fully expects to be paid the money that is owed us spokeswoman paula hallcollins said we have worked in very good faith with the state selling voluntarily into the market negotiating with them for longterm contracts and working with them to solve the problem enron corp an energy trader that has set aside unspecified reserve for possible losses in california has not been approached about debt forgiveness said karen denne a company spokeswoman this proposal is news to us and does not address the immediate problem of electricity shortages in california this summer denne said industry analysts say california which has already had scattered blackouts this winter will face more this summer when power demand surges buying the grid davis said at the meeting that negotiations to buy pge corps power transmission system may take another three zero days though he was optimistic an agreement could be reached within two weeks analysts said he offered few other specifics on the pge talks said steve fetter group managing director of global power for fitch inc state officials are trying to reach agreement with pge and edison as well as with sempra energy to buy their transmission lines as part of a plan to help them pay debt and borrow money at low interest rates to avoid bankruptcy a tentative agreement to buy edisons lines for two seven six billion was reached last week talks with sempra are continuing the governor said he was optimistic an agreement with pge could be reached in two weeks but negotiations could drag on longer fetter said we are making progress davis said at a news conference after the analysts meeting at the cornell club on the east side of manhattan we are close to a final agreement with edison and relatively close with sempra the governor told analysts hes confident he can get a utility rescue plan that doesnt require an immediate rate increase but davis did say that rate increases are going to be needed at some unspecified time in the future fetter said davis said he wasnt sure if he resolved all of analysts doubts about californias plans to save its utilities from bankruptcy hes in a hole and hes got a long way to go to get out of it said paul patterson an analyst with

zero two zero zero zero san francisco chronicle url httpwwwsfgatecomcgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchivetwo zero zero zero one zero two seven b ufour seven seven two three dtltypebusiness san franciscos pacific gas and electric co plans to come out with guns blazing today when it makes its case to state regulators for why ratepayers should be saddled with about three billion in unforeseen power costs but while the utility insists it is guided first and foremost by a sense of what is right and fair the reality is that pge is maneuvering with its back to the wall wall street that is no one wants to hold stock in a company that is subsidizing its customers said paul patterson an analyst at credit suisse first boston in new york if pge has to swallow this three billion investors will run in droves the whole idea of wall street is to enhance shareholder value agreed carol coale an analyst at prudential securities in houston pges management has to be seen to be doing that in documents filed with the california public utilities commission late wednesday the utility said it will not be left holding the bag for outstanding electricity costs accrued when wholesale power prices spiked sharply higher during the summer because of a current rate freeze the utility has been unable to pass along those additional costs in monthly power bills customers of san diego gas electric saw their bills triple this summer after sdge became the first california utility to qualify for an early end to the rate freeze a senior pge official requesting anonymity told the chronicle yesterday that there is virtually no room for compromise on whether the company will swallow even a portion of that three billion in unexpected costs he said pge intends to recoup its expenses either from customers or and this is a longshot in the form of refunds from power companies there is a strong feeling here that we have every right to collect every dime either from generators or customers the official said we have a pretty strong leg to stand on under federal law to get all of the money weve had to pay out analysts were mixed on whether federal law does indeed favor pge and fellow utility southern california edison on this question some agreed with the companies that electricity distributors cannot be held accountable for surging wholesale power prices and that ratepayers must pay for the power they use but others pointed out that electricity customers were told when californias energy market was deregulated in one nine nine six that they would be protected by a rate freeze until early two zero zero two and that this rate freeze precludes utilities from passing along any extra charges until that time legal matters aside no one doubts that the stakes are high for investors and that this is very much on the minds of pge executives as they go into todays puc hearing if youre an owner of the stock you want management to take a position that minimizes loss said paul fremont an analyst at jefferies co in new york pges share price dipped four four cents yesterday to two seven one three still well above its five two week low of one nine six nine pge has to stick to its guns to maintain financial stability said patterson at credit suisse first boston prudentials coale stressed that shareholders would not take kindly to any solution that involves a big hit on pges bottom line what shareholders do not want to see is a huge writedown she said you would hope for the solvency of the company that pges management would care most about shareholders not ratepayers at this point that seems to be the case the senior pge official said the only thing the utility is prepared to negotiate is the length of time ratepayers should be given to pay off the three billion he said four years of surcharges atop customers regular monthly bills is one possibility but quickly added that pge could be flexible on how long the surcharges are imposed thats where we see room for compromise the official said until recently the puc had been unwilling to even discuss whether utility customers and not the utilities should be paying the unforeseen power costs that changed when the commissioners recently agreed to accept a request from pge and southern california edison that they revisit the matter todays public hearing is the first step in that process for its part edison wants to pass along to customers about two three billion in costs over a fiveyear span puc president loretta lynch said commissioners are trying to keep an open mind about how best to resolve the dispute which threatens to explode from a regulatory issue into a political hot potato a lot of folks are pitching a lot of ideas she said no decisions have been made in fact a major wild card is what the federal energy regulatory commission will do if anything to stabilize californias electricity market the commission is scheduled to issue a draft report wednesday outlining its intentions federal commissioners refused yesterday to discuss the contents of their draft report saying only that they have been working hard to determine whether californias power prices are just and reasonable and if not what to do about it the california situation has been incredibly difficult and thought provoking and time consuming said commissioner linda key breathitt while federal regulators have authority to demand that power generators refund consumers if found to have illegally manipulated prices few observers expect such a harsh step to be taken rather the commissioners are widely expected to impose new restrictions on wholesale electricity prices for a limited period of time california wholesale prices are now capped at two five zero per megawatt ironically surging wholesale prices could also benefit pge customers the utility reaps profit from selling power it generates into the wholesale market and has proposed that revenue from its network of dams and the diablo canyon nuclear power plant be shared in the future with ratepayers if such a scheme were to get the green light from the puc the senior pge official said this could shave about onefourth off the three billion and lessen the pain a little bit for ratepayers ultimately however the utility will have to convince not just the puc but also its customers that passing along billions of dollars in extra charges is the most appropriate solution its going to be a difficult sell public relationswise said herbert hart an analyst at redwood securities group in san francisco pge just got done reporting an excellent quarter the utilitys parent company pge corp reported this week that its quarterly operating income jumped three four percent to two four eight million six eight cents per share from one

four two seven recent events rule one never assume an issue is done until the ink is dry from the governors signature and even then you never know the senate republicans agreed late this week to oppose sb two eight x sher which makes several iepsponsored proposals to the siting process due to a controversial provision added in the assembly appropriations committee regarding unemployment compensation assembly republicans let it slide on process because cmta and the chambers objections to the egregious language was so last minute senate republicans had more time to look at the issue and agreed not to let it go forward since they control of the final vote in a bill requiring twothirds their united opposition stopped the bill one vote shy the author was granted reconsideration and discussions will be ongoing over the next week on how to proceed the bestcase scenario at this point is getting one republican to drop from the ranks worstcase scenario is the bill dies and our language gets picked up in another vehicle starting the whole process all over again the more likely scenario however lies somewhere in between parties will agree to some compromise language send the bill back to the assembly to make the appropriate changes then bring it back to the senate for a clean vote longterm contracting was moved to the front burner this week by asm wright ab five seven and senator morrow sb nine nine seven both with different results both measures which are almost identical set forth a criteria which if followed by an iou when signing a longterm contract with an energy supplier would eliminate the need for a reasonableness review by the cpuc ab five seven passed out of the assembly utilities and commerce committee with little discussion and a few technical amendments sb nine nine seven faced a longer more difficult hearing in front of senator bowens energy committee iep along with the three ious testified in support of the measure while turn expressed great concerns with the concept of leaving the cpuc out of the picture in the end the senate committee agreed to put the bill off for further discussions passed a motion in support of getting the appropriate rule waver so the bill can be heard again after fridays policy committee deadline and scheduled a stakeholder meeting for thursday morning senator burton announced on the senate floor thursday morning however that all requests for rule wavers would be denied ab five seven appears to be the only active vehicle on this issue and iep will be at the negotiating table providing input on the language as it moves forward ab six zero x is scheduled for hearing next week in the senate energy committee iep met with committee staff this week which revealed some possible latitude in amending the bill iep and other member company lobbyists will be pushing hard for an opposed position from the rest of the committee before the hearing tuesday afternoon at this time however we do not have any alternative language for the bill after further review by some iep member companies the previously drafted amendments appear unworkable and were withdrawn from consideration we anticipate on waiting to see where the committee on tuesday takes the issue before another attempt at drafting alternative language sb one x sotoscott was amended this week before its hearing in the senate appropriations committee next week the new language finds a backdoor to the price cap issue by imposing a one zero zero percent tax on the sale of electric power that exceeds a base price of eight zero per mwhr cmta the chamber and caltax will be coordinating strategy for the hearing with iep and the generators but despite the bills multiple constitutional and legal problems most admit the measure will move forward with little trouble a new player on the scene will probably provide the most noteworthy testimony intergen north america which is developing a nine zero zero mw power plant in palm springs plans on testifying that if this measure is signed by the governor they will absolutely pull the project and go to oklahoma newly amended this week is ab six seven x cardoza which now makes it a felony for a corporation that sells electricity or natural gas at unjust or unreasonable rates sponsored by lt governor bustamante the measure establishes stiff fines and possible jail time that could be subject to the states three strikes law ab six seven x has already generated opposition from republicans and constitutional questions from legal experts although cardoza noted that several aspects of the bill are unresolved and could change the intent will remain the same and he insists that energy companies that take advantage of californians will still face significant penalties sb six x burton which establishes a state power authority passed the assembly this week by a four eight to two eight vote the measure needs the senate to concur on the assembly amendments

would provide additional evidence supporting its missouri application and refile a petition with the fcc as soon as possible the fcc would have nine zero days after the filing of the new petition to decide whether sbc had complied with section two seven one of the telecommunications act of one nine nine six which mandates that bell operating companies meet a one four point competitive checklist of marketopening requirements before they can offer inregion interlata services refiling the application would enable sbc to further address questions raised by the department of justice and others over sbcs original application as well as provide updated evidence of continued compliance with section two seven one sbc said justice didnt recommend that the fcc reject the application but it did raise several questions including whether sbcs unbundled network element rates in missouri complied with the fccs telric totalelement longrun incremental cost standard tr may one four we believe our application for missouri passes all the tests and missouri regulators agreed by unanimously endorsing our application said priscilla hillardoin sbc senior vice president our markets are open as the rapid growth of competition in the state demonstrates but it is important that our application record include a comprehensive response to several new issues raised since our missouri application was filed we would rather the fcc vote on the most current information available in a statement issued late this afternoon fcc chairman michael k powell said during the fcc common carrier bureaus review of sbcs section two seven one application for authority to offer long distance service in missouri concerns surfaced related to cost based pricing in its region and operation support systems oss given

month telecom lawmakers and industry officials today made a new round of policy pitches on the subject their audience was the more than one zero zero congressional staffers at todays internet caucus luncheon in the us capitol the luncheon at times seemed like a minihearing lawmakers offered their usual arguments challenged each others claims and asked those in attendance for support in a separate panel held later industry representatives drew swords over broadband services legislation carrying the flag for the bell companies bill of choice the internet freedom and broadband deployment act hr one five four two were rep wj billy tauzin r la its author and reps rick boucher d va and bob goodlatte r va filling out the congressional panel were two of the more outspoken skeptics of the datarelief legislation reps steve largent r okla and christopher cannon r utah rep largent argued that hr one five four two s provision to eliminate the in region interlata local access and transport area restrictions on the bell companies provision of data services would remove the bells incentive to open their local markets its like changing the rules of the game in the middle of the game he said no other industry has that kind of domination by one entity like the bells do in the local loop rep tauzin fired back saying the bell companies were always in the middle of a game the one four point marketopening checklist found in section two seven one of the telecommunications act of one nine nine six has become one one zero zero points he said and the fcc has gummed things up so badly that att corp can sit there beautifully and stymie entry into the cable modem market he said hr one five four two would correct that discrepancy and spur competition by putting the bells provision of advanced services on equal regulatory footing with the broadband offerings of cable tv providers said reps boucher and tauzin but att loves the status quo so much thats why theyve spent all this money on tv ads opposing hr one five four two rep tauzin said there is a good chance that hr one five four two will be taken up on the house floor before the july four break he said rep cannon who advocates a different approach to spurring advanced service deployment said att chairman and chief executive officer c michael armstrong told him yesterday that congresss consideration of hr one five four two has contributed to wall streets sour outlook on the competitive local exchange carrier clec industry mr armstrong said he had no interest in buying a clec as long as hr one five four two is out there rep cannon said i dont agree that those companies are failing because of bad business plans he added the bells have blocked their access to local markets during the industry panel hr one five four two s provision to scale back the fccs rules on line sharing sparked debate between larry clinton vice presidentlarge company affairs for the us telecom association and thomas koutsky vplaw and public policy for ztel technologies inc if you want competition for local phone service you dont want line sharing mr clinton told attendees but mr koutsky said the point of line sharing and unbundling was

day by patrick mcmahon usa today bellingham wash last summer an underground pipeline ruptured in a city park here and sent a torrent of gasoline along a wooded streambed toward two one zero yearolds playing with a barbecue lighter after the one six inch pipeline had been hemorrhaging for an hour and three four minutes an explosion sent a fireball racing through the park a plume of smoke rose three zero zero zero zero feet authorities say the blast probably was triggered by a spark from the lighter there was a spark and the sky turned orange the boys both told me afterward says frank king whose son wade was one of the boys in the park wade and his friend stephen tsiorvas were burned over nine zero of their bodies they died the next day also killed was one eight yearold liam wood who had graduated from high school five days before the collegebound wood was flyfishing in the park when he was overcome by fumes fell into the creek and drowned to many people the boys were considered heroes says mark asmundson the mayor of this seaside city north of seattle in sparking the explosion the boys kept the most extensive damage confined to the two four one acre park he says the river of gasoline was heading right for the center of the city on monday the senate commerce committee held a oneday hearing here about five minutes from where the incident occurred on legislation to improve safety and government oversight of pipelines and the companies that operate them the hearing included gripping sometimes tearful testimony from the boys parents as well as statements from state and federal officials my baby died because of inaction his death was preventable said katherine dalen stephens mother more than two million miles of iron steel and plastic pipes some as large as five feet in diameter snake beneath the earth and deliver oil gasoline natural gas and potential disaster across america every day they range from the transalaskan pipeline to tiny pipes carrying natural gas to peoples homes safer than gasoline trucks or oceangoing tankers by most measures onceremote pipelines are prompting new worries as sprawling metropolitan areas grow into their paths us pipeline accidents have fluctuated in the past one zero years in the one nine nine zero s there were three nine one seven liquid fuel spills and natural gas leaks roughly one a day the incidents most involving local lines carrying natural gas resulted in two zero one deaths two eight two six injuries and seven seven eight million in property damage from one nine nine zero through one nine nine nine there also are environmental costs in january one of the nations largest pipeline companies koch industries of wichita kan paid a three zero million civil fine to settle environmental protection agency waterpollution charges involving three zero zero oil spills from one nine nine zero to one nine nine seven the epa said koch failed to inspect its pipelines and waited for leaks before making repairs liam woods mother marlene robinson is focused on stronger regulations nationwide including more and better inspections and regional watchdog committees i dont have any children left to protect she said in an interview and repeated at the hearing this didnt have to happen to liam and it doesnt have to happen to other peoples children although the cause of the bellingham incident remains under investigation one factor might have been damage to the pipeline from a backhoe when a water line was being installed in one nine nine five but investigators also have many questions about the role of olympic pipeline co which operates a network of pipelines along a two nine nine mile corridor from north of bellingham to portland ore investigators for the national transportation safety board ntsb want to know whether olympic ignored warning signs and whether it could have acted more swiftly after the leak but the inquiry has been delayed by a parallel investigation by the us attorneys office several olympic employees have declined to testify and have invoked their constitutional rights against selfincrimination pipeline owners and government regulators defend the safety of transporting twothirds of the nations fuels by pipeline and they warn that more rules could boost energy prices critics say pipelines are too loosely regulated not fully inspected and in some cases deteriorating the us transportation department oversees pipelines its office of pipeline safety sets standards for design operation maintenance and emergency response richard felder who heads the office testified at mondays hearing our goal is to prevent incidents like bellingham from ever happening again he said in an earlier interview he defended his offices performance and the industry its a good record its the safest form of transporting fuel far and away the office has extensive rules on pipeline safety including requirements for signs along the route and programs to alert potential diggers but theres no such thing as risk elimination felder says all you can do is manage it but the chairman of the federal governments transportation safety watchdog agency is unimpressed with felders office and says it deserves a grade of f its been the most frustrating area ive had to deal with as chairman says jim hall ntsb chairman since one nine nine four he says no agency has a worse record of responding to ntsb recommendations in a recent speech he said theres no indication that the office of pipeline safety is in charge or that its regulations its inspections its assets its staffing and its spirit are adequate to the task felder takes issue with much of the criticism but he endorses calls for more research into pipeline safety he said his office is in the final stages of preparing new safety standards for heavily populated and environmentally sensitive areas he emphasized that the leading cause of pipeline failure is thirdparty damage from road utility and construction work the agency has worked to enhance a system to alert pipeline companies of digging with one telephone call felder is critical of local authorities who ignore pipelines when making decisions on housing and commercial development local planning has not kept people away from pipelines he says its astounding to me felder bristles at critics suggestions that his agency is a tool of the oil and gas industry i cant agree with that one iota he says we try to balance the safety issue and the economic issue the senate commerce committee will consider a bipartisan bill sponsored by sens patty murray dwash and slade gorton rwash rep jack metcalf the republican who represents bellingham and rep jay inslee a democrat whose district includes an operating section of the pipeline the bill would require periodic internal inspections of pipelines boost federal spending on research increase the number of federal pipeline inspectors nationwide there now are five five and expand states regulatory authority on monday the office of pipeline safety gave the state of washington the temporary right to do more inspections the murraygorton bill also would require federal certification of pipeline workers and expand the publics right to know about spills and leaks i was totally shocked and amazed when this happened murray says you always assume that your neighborhood is safe and somebody has taken care of this the bellingham rupture not only dumped two seven eight zero zero zero gallons of gasoline into this city of six three zero zero zero near the canadian border but also unleashed civic furor at olympic pipeline its hard for people to get interested in things they cant see out of sight is out of mind mayor asmundson says he has visited the boys grieving families and lobbied congress the blast has dominated my life since june one zero pipeline operators portray accidents as isolated to escape national scrutiny he says the whole focus of the industry is containment do whatever you have to do

bill alert jeff in response to your questions i cannot explain why everyone missed this bill in the past i have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in the last two months however now that it is moving they have got the message williams kern river is going to host a meeting today to create a coalition to oppose the bill bev hansen knows where the meeting will take place in addition to williams i understand that questar wspa and other retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill my client wild goose will also be listed in opposition but they dont carry that much clout or name recognition so far i am hopeful that other groups will surface soon as for the bill itself the problem is two fold first the cpuc decides what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities they take input from customers but loretta is a command and control type all the way and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a goldplated stateregulated system while the bill does not and cannot legally bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates the large customers have to commit to take firm service on a five year basis with exit fees if they dont take this they can only get interruptible service from the utilities many if not all large customers especially generators cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the ldc system this is the same dilemma that the rls tariff caused my belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to reinstitute the rls tariff or an onerous peaking rate the commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm five year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate my view is based on sempras reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by lynchs office this could interfere with enron gas sales over the interstates and would certainly threaten any transwestern plans for building across the border into california although that does not appear to be a high priority at this time this bill will also make it more costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of their needs please call if you have further questions mike day original message from jeffdasovichenroncom mailtojeffdasovichenroncom sent

two three xx bad bill alert ive taken a quick look at the bill and have attached for easy viewing few questions mike i understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on behalf of questar do we know if the other pipelines have been active in any discussions on this bill what about the generators have then been involved since presumably their in need of lots more capacity and theyre referenced in the bill what about large customers they been screaming for more infrastructure too and many have blamed socalgas and the puc for not delivering it do we know if pipelines generators large customers are supporting or opposing the bill ill try to check around too in between the electric mayhem there doesnt seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates from building into the state if thats true wouldnt the puc take those projects into account when doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct and noncore to take capacity that isnt already being met by others ie interstates bringing pipe into the state any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful dont want enron too far out in front of opposition until we find

represents sempra in the berg gaselectric class action filed in los angeles two one three two two nine seven five five six rlevygdclawcom i asked him whether he would tell me if they were considering removal of the berg action he told me that he had our removal papers he asked if we had any research that we were willing to share with him he said they looked at preemption filed rate doctrine ripeness etc and concluded that ultimately we would be in state court he also said that he did not believe there were any good motions to dismiss that were worth making i told him that some of the work product was a joint defense effort that would require permission to share eg the paul hastings memo but that there was other work product we might be willing to share that had been done on behalf of enron i told him that i believed that there was good ninth circuit authority that was helpful and we really believed federal court was a better forum for these types of cases he told me he was willing to look at whatever authorities we could give him i also told him that i understood that mike weaver represented sempra in the san diego cases and gave him mikes contact information he asked for copies of our complaints and i sent them on to him he is willing to discuss the case and possibly strategic alternatives he told me that el paso had retained david palmer formerly of gibson dunn to represent them in this action el paso and david palmer are supposedly meeting on wednesday january three rd according to rich their time to remove expires on january one six th he told me that the berg case was originally filed in texas by the denver law firm astrella rice against el paso that case was dismissed because the plaintiff was not a direct purchaser the plaintiffs then sought to have southern california edison agree to be the named plaintiff apparently they refused rich said they were meeting with sce to find out what else was said there is a second gas complaint the continental forge case apparently this case was filed in september but never served it has now been amended and has been served a copy is attached we obtained this copy from the plaintiffs website so it does not have a signature for file stamp but rich levy said it was the complaint that had been served continental forgecmpltpdf puc hearings i do not have many of the details of the hearings other than a report from mike day that michael aguirre plaintiffs counsel in our case argued before the puc that the real culprits are the power marketers and the solution to the utilities problem is for the utilities to join the plaintiffs class action in san diego apparently today aguirre was cross examining the utility and generator witnesses before the puc attempting to aid counsel for the ratepayers trying to show that the utilities should sue the power marketers public record act request michael aguirre has made a public record act request for all information subpoenaed by the puc and any other documents related to alleged wrongdoing from the iso the puc has set january three rd as the response date for comments on the request data provided by iso to the puc the iso has told market participants that they have provided day ahead and hour ahead schedules to the puc bids actual metered operations rmr oom and oos calls generation out of service information and import and export schedules epmi data jeff richter reported today that he believes they now understand some of the data problems with the epmi data i am scheduled to be in portland with jeff on friday to resolve the data issues and discuss integration of ongoing data collection with pending and potential discovery requests cornerstone teleconference dave noonan reports that michael keeley at cornerstone is very interested in being retained one of his partners has been contacted by another defendant but has not yet been retained by them yet dave suggested that we try and do a telephone interview of michael tomorrow and retain him if we like what we hear his cv is set forth below i will try to coordinate a time tomorrow morning ag investigation so far the california ag has been reducing the scope of its data retention request for ees they basically wanted a snapshot and nothing else for the time being as for individual computers they want an organizational chart to select six one two computers that they are interested in epmi tapes prepared in anticipation of litigation we are awaiting specific model information about the nicelog taping system used in portland dan dietrich in it in houston is getting that information for us we believe we will have access to some technology that will assist in the review of these materials we will also distribute shortly the results of our research on the production of such materials and any exact transcripts prepared of those litigation materials current trading practices christian yoder steve hall marcus woods alan comnes dan watkiss richard sanders and myself discussed current trading practices in the out of market and over one five zero cap scenarios in short if the iso calls for power two zero minutes before the hour it is needed there is no cap in some instances epmi will have purchased power for x and offer to sell it to the iso at x the plus factor being the credit risk andor the refund risk for having sold that power in addition to prevailing market conditions in the over one five zero cap situation epmi will be collecting its cost data to compare with the prices charged the iso or px epmi will be matching its iso and px sales data with comparable high cost energy in its portfolio this is consistent with ferc preexisting practice we also discussed standard instructions to traders price gouging statute richard sanders has asked that we revisit the california price gouging statute in view of the current trading practices california penal code section three nine six prohibits price increases upon the proclamation of a state of emergency by the president governor or executive officer of any county or city resulting from a natural or manmade disaster for thirty days after such a proclamation it is unlawful for any business to sell or offer to sell any consumer goods goods or services used for emergency cleanup for a price of more than one zero percent above the price charged by that person for those goods or services immediately prior to the proclamation of emergency such a violation is a misdemeanor punishable by one year of jail time and a fine of up to one zero zero zero zero a violation also constitutes an unlawful business practice under section one seven two zero zero it is unclear whether this statute includes the sale of electricity and or the declaration of a state of emergency by the iso ed kee engagement letter mike kirby forwarded the form of engagement letter from ed kee charles river engagement letter i have been in discussions with charles river over the form of the

will become chairman of the energy and natural resources committee when democrats take control of the senate later this week bush wants to make it easier for companies like enron corp exxon mobil corp and bp plc to build power plants and pipelines by easing regulations and hes opposed to regulating the carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global warming bingaman has introduced legislation to cut emissions to curb global warming the presidents proposal to drill in the arctic national wildlife refuge in trouble even with republicans in charge is dead as long as democrats have control bingaman has no plans to consider it bush opposes caps on energy prices bingaman is cosponsor of legislation to impose caps on wholesale energy prices in california although according to a spokesman hed prefer the federal energy regulatory commission do that on its own seeking consensus bingaman says rather than offer his own plan now hell try to sit down with republicans and negotiate something both sides can agree on there is already agreement on some proposals such offering tax credits to encourage domestic drilling and the use by business of renewable energy technology such as windpowered turbines obviously im going to work for consensus he said theres nothing about much of these issues that should be partisan bingaman says he hasnt decided whether to push a single comprehensive energy bill or move issues separately democrats may insist on separate bills for political purposes said tim evans a senior energy analyst at ifr pegasus theyll say lets get all of the most vulnerable republicans on record supporting drilling and see if they get re elected he said whatever his decision bingaman wont meet murkowskis goal to have a bill for bush to sign on july four im not anxious to have some artificial deadline so that we can have a billsigning ceremony on a holiday bingaman said i dont think thats the way to legislate visionary or donothing throughout his career bingaman has made a

nomination he sees trends opponents see inaction he doesnt accumulate much in the way of negatives by not doing much said john dendahl chairman of the republican party of new mexico bingaman is a

leadership eight seven percent of the time on votes in which the two parties took opposing positions according to data compiled by congressional quarterly fundraising success in the senate bingamans strategy has been to home in on issues that have been neglected such as school accountability and defense research that has civilian uses work with others and not hog the credit he wouldnt try to beat it to the front of the class said ben alexander a bingaman fundraiser that approach appears to have worked republicans havent been able to budge bingaman from his senate seat by appealing to new

oil company donated one three million according to the center for responsive politics comparison with murkowski environmentalists said bingaman will balance conservation and production concerns better than murkowski murkowski wants to jam through an agenda to boost production said alyssondra campaigne legislative director of the national resources defense council bingaman tends to be more studious

one the associated press all rights reserved eugene ore ap natural gas generators could ease demand and prices for electricity in the southern willamette valley where businesses and utilities are bracing for skyrocketing rates and power shortages the biggest proposal is a five zero zero megawatt power plant that texas energy giant enron corp may build on industrial property in the coburg area possibly on the site where willamette industries runs a wood products plant by comparison eugene and neighboring springfield use a total of about four five zero megawatts the rest of the proposals are for smaller operations that mostly would be connected to local businesses and mills everyones looking for power says frank lambe general manager of the emerald peoples utility district even if the enron plant is built within emeralds service territory it doesnt mean the local utility would get any of the power enron with revenues of more than one zero zero billion typically sells power to the highest bidder in fact an enron plant likely would require emerald to buy another one zero megawatts of electricity on the open market to run the plants lights heating and other needs emerald board member katherine schacht who represents the coburg area said shes concerned that the power from the enron plant would go to california rather than helping meet local energy needs she also said there are a lot of questions that need to be asked and answered about the plants impact on water air quality and other issues the enron plant would be similar to those now under construction in the hermiston area and in klamath falls those plants are several stories high emit large amounts of carbon dioxide and consume between two zero zero zero and two four zero zero gallons of water a minute carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas isnt a regulated pollutant enron and the businesses considering their own generators would buy natural gas from the main northsouth pipeline that runs down the willamette valley the plans are only preliminary but they illustrate growing concern about future price increases that could reach one zero zero percent this fall and worries that the region will suffer energy shortages for the next several years many businesses also see a chance to make money by generating electricity in a market with wholesale prices that have jumped over three zero zero a megawatt one zero times the going rate a year ago enron hasnt applied for any permits for a plant in the eugene area nor has the company given the state an official notice that it intends to build the plant but enron has notified the bonneville power administration the federal power marketing agency in portland that supplies the northwest with half its electricity that it is considering building the plant if enron does build a plant in the eugene area it would need a permit from the lane regional air pollution authority to emit nitrogen oxides and any other contaminants a large plant also

shortage or a little bit of a price spike it is always collusion or conspiracy or something i mean it always makes people feel better that way bury and right in the middle a federal agency youve probably never heard of mr curtis hebert chairman federal energy regulatory commission they didnt build this monopolistic system overnight and we wont change it overnight either bury tonight power play whos to blame for the energy crisis announcer from abc news this is nightline substituting for ted koppel and reporting from washington chris bury bury california is known as the great american incubator from hem lines to hulahoops the golden state gives birth to trends that often spread east that is why so many states are paying close attention to californias troubled attempt at deregulating electricity last week california governor gray davis asked president bush for help in the form of a price cap on power companies the president said no now governor davis is threatening to sue the federal agency that regulates electricity prices more on that later but first the results of a new abc newswashington post poll it suggests that president bush is developing an energy problem when asked what they think of the presidents performance on energy a clear majority five eight percent say they disapprove thats up one five percent since mr bush released his energy plan when asked if they think the united states is heading into an energy crisis six in one zero americans answer yes text abc news poll the washington post margin of error three zero how do you rate the presidents performance on energy june three may one three disapprove five eight four three do you think the us is heading into an energy crisis yes six one no three six bury california is already there for months now the new york times and the public broadcasting program frontline have teamed up to investigate their collaboration blackout airs tomorrow night on many pbs stations it documents a colossal mismatch in the brand new game of buying and selling power on the open market its like the new york yankees against the toledo mud hens unidentified woman two we didnt use his five because their minimum was you know higher than what we were willing to pay unidentified man two ill sell you one zero eight now bury vo on one side companies such as enron the texas energy broker trade electricity like any other commodity a sophisticated trading operation buys and sells billions of dollars worth of energy every day its the largest company of its kind in the world unidentified man three see what im saying kelly crs this is kelly bury vo on the other side in this converted department store in sacramento is californias trading team unidentified man four this is the operations center this is thethis is the location where we make energy purchases and fill the state of california energy requirements bury vo here employees drafted from the states water department go headtohead with the pros from enron and other companies since one nine nine nine the cost to california has skyrocketed from seven billion to an estimated six zero billion this year an increase of seven five zero percent and the demand for electricity up less than five percent oc in their documentary reporters for the new york times and frontline address a fundamental question whos to blame narrating this segment is frontline correspondent lowell bergman unidentified man five our forecast reserves look like theyd be pretty thin over the peak as well unidentified man six how much is lowell bergman reporting vo the power industry blames the high prices on shortages brought on by californias failure to build any major power plants over the last decade despite a booming economy mr lay i mean we have a supplydemand imbalance too much demand too little supply in california bergman vo not everyone agrees consumer advocates in california accuse the generators of actually withholding supply ms nettie hoge executive director turn the idea that all of a sudden we had a supply crunch is preposterous what happened is all of a sudden the new plant owners and the traders like mr lays organization looked at the data and figured out how to manipulate the market as soon as that happened the prices never went down again if it was totally a supply problem why would we have excess prices at five zero zero in the morning on christmas day when nobody but santa is working bergman vo the generators in turn say they shut down plants for routine winter maintenance mr lay every time theres a shortage or a little bit of a price spike its always collusion or conspiracy or something i mean it always makes people feel better that way bergman but you know as well as i do that the priceits nice for a business mr lay yeah bergman youre in the business ofof making money for your shareholders mr lay mmhmm bergman right as a company mr lay yeah bergman so you would be foolish as you said to turn down the kind of money you could make this past winter in california isisnt there a mr lay iii think you put words in my mouth out there bergman ok mr lay i said wewe made some money in california we made some money across the country and around the world i mean and as i tell my friends in california enron was doing quite well before california imploded unidentified man seven so you cant blame the enrons i mean theyre the guysthatsthats what they do they try to make as much money from the money that they get invested you blame the regulators bergman vo across the country tucked in an out of the way building behind union station in washington dc sits the federal energy regulatory commission or ferc fercs commissioners are appointed by the president and control a two five zero billion energy sector critical to americas economy with the coming of deregulation state control over wholesale electricity rates passed to the federal government making ferc the final arbiter of just and reasonable rates its a power ferc has been reluctant to use curt hebert is a protege of senator trent lott who convinced president clinton to appoint hebert to the ferc in one nine nine seven in january president bush made him the ferc chairman and hebert has made no bones about where he stands on free markets mr hebert the rules of competition govern that economies work that choice works its why were american we inherently like choice its why we left the mother country we didnt like the rules they were setting we wanted to make our own rules we want our own choices and we believe that works bergman ok but is electricity different mr hebert its a transition it takes some time look they didnt build this monopolistic system overnight and we wont change it overnight either mr william massey ferc commissioner without some effective price control this summer i fear for the worst bergman vo william massey is a ferc commissioner a democrat who has found himself in opposition to his chairman unidentified man eight mr massey what is the nub of the disagreement that you have with mr hebert mr massey i think what it boils down to is a philosophical disagreement about the role of my agency in ensuring just and reasonable prices i think its long past time for this agency to step in andand impose a temporary time out on the markets mr hebert well that is the problem because these people are saying temporary but they dont mean temporary its kind of like the temporary rent control you have in new york its not temporary at all matter of fact you know in washington dc we dont do temporary very well and thats a problem bergman vo in fact late last year after six months of unrelenting high prices in california the ferc finally did declare californias rates unjust and unreasonable but took no action governor gray davis governor california so they found these people guilty a year ago they just havent agreed on the sentence bergman well we talked with curt hebert and we got gov davis well thats you know bergman thats what gov davis lots of luck bergman what do you mean lots of luck gov davis because bergman hes the federalhes the guy you are turning to to give you the money gov davis he is the chairman of the commission but he has not been overly sympathetic to california hes more of an ideologue than a problem solver bergman well hes saying you just want him to give you shortterm relief price caps which wont solve the problem gov davis problems meaning fattening the balance sheet of already enormously wealthy energy companies bury how much blame do the energy companies really deserve bergman watch youryour heating bills your natural gas bills which are to a certain extent reflected in your electricity bill and dont think that this couldnt happen where you are bury and how much of this energy crisis did california bring upon itself those questions when we come back announcer this is abc news nightline brought to you by commercial break bury joining us from boston lowell bergman the correspondent for tomorrows frontline broadcast from our los angeles bureau laura holson a business correspondent for the new york times whos been covering the california energy crisis and here in washington joe kahn who reports on energy and economics for the new york times laura just before the break we heard california governor davis blaming the energy companies and the federal regulators how much of his argument is sinking in in other words whom do californians blame for this ms laura holson the new york times the interesting thing is californians blame everybody for this apfor what has happened with the energy crisis they blame the governor for not responding quickly enough to a crisis that started you know a year ago if you really you know look at when prices starting going up they are angry at their utilities who they feel have failed them they have often had very close kind of paternal relationships with their utilities and they feel that theyve been cheated and they are very angry with the power generators in particular who they feel are charging them just exorbitant amounts for energy in particular there was a company last week a power generator that said it charged consumers rather the utilities four zero zero zero nearly four zero zero zero per megawatt hour which is enough to light a thousand homes for one hour and when they heard this they were outraged they just thought you know how can this be how can we get in their terms kind of ripped off by power generators who are using them to make you know a lot of money bury joe kahn we heard those poll numbers from this survey out tonight suggesting that president bush has a bit of a public relations problem on energy how is that going to affect the politics here in washington mr joseph kahn the new york times well clearly thepresident bush and the white house are calculating that by the time people have to go to the polls to select a new president a slew of new power plants will be online in california electricity prices presumably will come down quite a bit and their free market stance on this will not ultimately cost him at the polls its not as clear that republicans in the congress have the same commitment this has already been a very turbulent time in washington with the democrats now in control of the senate i think you can expect to see a legislative initiative by the democrats to introduce some kind of price caps in california some republicans may sign on to that some have already indicated that they will its going to be a real knockdown political flightfight in washington over what the strategy ought to be bury lowell bergman talk a little bit about that free market activity that joe just mentioned we saw the clip from your documentary with thethe traders from enron pitted against thethe buyers from california and i must say it really did look like a mismatch bergman well in fact some of the people at enron told us that they welcome the day when pge and southern california edison the regular utilities get back in the marketplace because they do feel like theyve got them if you will outgunned andbut i should point out to the audience that when laura was talking about this three eight zero zero a megawatt hour which was duke energy company the normal price if you will the standard price for a megawatt hour was around four zero or less so the level of profit that were talking about is what people are upset about and the problem here isis primarily that in a free market and the way that the marketplace in california is set up in particular theres no limit to what could becould be charged when you get close to that area of scarcity with electricity electricity truly is different and as jeff skillings says in our documentary hes the ceo of enron it is the most volatile commodity in the world bury yet at the same time joe we are seeing electricity traded as if it were oil or soybeans or steel i mean how is electricity different mr kahn well for economic reasons its different in ain a couple of key respects for one thing its an absolutely vital commodity people arent prepared to do without it moreover electricity powers every other part of the economy so its one of these sort of fundamental rights that we have in fact as far back as the new deal franklin roosevelt made clear that electricity was so important that it would be subject to federal legislation guaranteeing everybody in this country just and reasonable electricity prices bury but just and reasonable electricity prices laura do you want to pick up the question of well who determines whats just and reasonable here ms holson well its very clear that president bush believes that the market you know sets whats just and reasonable and you know that has not been what governor davis has said at all he believes that because this is a commodity that people you know believe is guaranteed that there should be some price cap on it its an interesting if you will situation when business and politics kind of intersect governor davis said very early on that he did not want two things to happen in california one is that the utilities would go bankrupt and the second was that rates would be raised for consumers and hes in a very tight spot right now because those two things that he did not want to happen indeed have happened and it only looks like it will get worse this summer when experts have said californians can expect another two six zero hours of blackouts bury laura we have to take a break but when we come back we want to address the question of whether power companies are doing what just comes naturally to them back with our guests in a moment commercial break bury were back with frontlines lowell bergman and laura holson and joe kahn of the new york times joe arent these power companies doing exactly what they are supposed to be doing which is maximaximizing profits and to get the biggest return for their shareholders mr kahn sure thats their responsibility theythey have no excuse for arbitrarily lowering the price that they could charge for electricity if the market will bear a higher price bury lowell bergman in your documentary do you find any evidence that the power companies areare gouging consumers or doing anything illegal bergman well illegality no one really has any serious evidence although there have been lots of allegations and theres been lots of speculation about it but we should also point out in the documentary and in the times that some of the companies are starting to realize it seems that even though they are owed hundreds of millions in some cases five zero zero million or more still by these bankrupt utilities theyre going to have to take a hair cut as governor davis describes it theyre going to have to make some bargain and i think we may bury let me jump in there what do you mean theyre going to have to get a hair cut bergman well apparently thats governor daviss way of telling them that theyre going to have to take less to aless than a full dollar payment for what they are owed and that there has to be some kind of settlement here of between the various parties other were nototherwise we wont see any progress bury lowell one of the old cliches in investigative reporting is follow the money and much has been made of this argument that the bush administration accusations have been made that the bush administration is too cozy with the power companies and the power company regulators what did you find in your reporting bergman well we found that vice president cheney was very up front about it i mean about his relationship with ken lay the head of enron the fact that he built a stadium for enron when he was head of halliburton you know the vice president is the first ceo of a fortune five zero zero company to hold presidential office in the history of the united states sobut they are very open and up front and balance this relationship with their friends and with the people who they feel comfortable with bury laura holson this idea that so many texas companies are profiting from californias misery as it were i suppose californians find that particularly infuriating ms holson its funny in the san francisco bay area when i was growing up near there there was this great rivalry between the san francisco four nine ers which is as we all know a football team and the dallas cowboys and that seems to be replaced if you will with consumers in california who look at texas genat you know a lot of the power generators which are based in texas and who they feel now are just you know making a lot of money off them itstheres always been a rivalry between those two states and now i think its deeply personal because its hitting consumers or as they believe it its hitting them in their pocket books bury joe kahn how long before these new power plants are going to be coming on line and before they do or in the time before they do whatwhat is it that the federal government can do to help california out mr kahn well itit will probably be about one eight months before sufficient new power comes online in california to start substantially changing the supply and demand equation there and thats a very speedy pace thats with a very expedited permit process for new plants the governor in california has put a lot of effort into building new platsplants quickly bury so what happens between now and then mr kahn well thats the question thats the debate the federal energy regulatory commission has the power under the federal power act in fact some people argue it has the obligation under the federal power act to ensure that just and reasonable electricity rates prevail in california at all times it cant just selectively choose the times and it has already found at the end of last year that rates in california are unjust and unreasonable bury so whats it doing about that mr kahn well itsits tried a variety of compromise measures so far very limited price controls on certain kinds of electricity sales during emergency hours so far that appears to be an insignificant contribution to reducing the overall electricity bill in california bury laura governor davis is demanding wholesale price controls president bush has made it pretty clear that hes not going to lean that way what options does governor davis have ms holson you know itsagain hes stuck in this place where itit doesnt look like hes got any kind of real out i mean he can try to demand he can demand as much as he wants from the power generators but if the federal government doesnt step in he really cant do anything the interesting thing at least i see kind of going forward is how californians have really adapted to a really you know awful situation theres a law thats being proposed right now in california in which businesses will know months in advance whether their neighborhood is going to be impacted by a blackout so they can plan i mean weve almost turned intoif anybody remembers traveling through italy during their college days you always kind of knew when the airlines or the trains were going to go on strike because they told you a day ahead of time and thats very much whats happening in california where theyre warning people you know two days an hour you know one day ahead of time so that they can prepare bury thats a pretty dark scenario lowell we just have a few seconds left what lessons should the rest of the country take from californias crisis bergman well watch youryour heating bills your natural gas bills which are to a certain extent reflected in your electricity bills and dont think that this couldnt happen where you are and i think that the industry itself is beginning to understand that the crisis in california may in fact impact on the future of deregulation nationally bury lowell bergman laura holson joe kahn thank you so much for joining us tonight bergman thank you mr kahn thank you ms holson thank you bury when we come back an update on a nightline broadcast from just over a month ago announcer to receive a daily email about each evenings nightline and a

confidence this follows the recognition of a substantial diminution in value of its global merchant investments which were partly financed with an aggressive use of offbalance sheet vehicles enron should be able to manage through this challenging environment ultimately recognizing the values of the companys core businesses in october enron fully drew down the bulk of its committed bank facilities and paid down outstanding commercial paper leaving it approximately one billion of cash on hand to support normal business activities in addition the company is in the process of executing a new one billion secured bank facility that pledges the assets of northern natural and transwestern unsecured creditors are structurally subordinated to the secured lenders reducing asset coverage while its current cash position appears adequate securing additional capital sources through asset sales or raising additional capital would be a favorable development a management priority is debt reduction and the exiting of problem businesses clearly these actions if completed as envisioned will reduce risk and improve the companys credit profile however the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution risk particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging market countries an additional uncertainty is the securities and exchange commissions sec investigation of certain enron sponsored partnerships the outcome and potential impact of the sec activity is difficult to predict the largest announced transaction is the sale of portland general electric copge to northwest natural gas co the sale appears to be moving ahead as planned and has the favorable support of key local interests however the transaction is not expected to close for another year enrons core businesses have continued to generate strong predictable performance and have significant value prospectively operations at enrons domestic regulated pipelines would be less affected by any lingering uncertainty at enron also pge is expected to generate positive and predictable earnings and cash flow over the next year combined the pipelines and pge generate nearly two five of ebitda wholesale and retail energy services segments have also consistently reported predictable and growing returns specifically commodity marketing and trading activities which comprise the most profitable and largest

governor davis announces bill package to increase renewable energ y distributed generation and cogeneration the governor held his press conference today at the cogeneration plant at the university of california medical center in sacramento all local tv print and radio news media outlets sent representatives although the focus of the news conference was supposed to be introduction of a legislative package promoting renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration it quickly turned to how the governor will deal with the possible bankruptcy of the utilities the governor said that it has become increasingly obvious to him that the best solution to the utilities financial problems is the acquisition of transmission lines he noted that the transmission lines are the utilities most significant asset and would be something the public would be able to get value from in perpetuity he said the arrangement will likely be a lease of the utilities lines with the companies continuing to maintain them to capture the utilities expertise details of this plan will be announced on friday the governor said the time and place for this announcement have yet to be released the governor later said he felt the utilities parentholding companies should be part of the solution so there would be shared pain in reaching a solution the governor said he suspected that acquisition of the transmission lines will involve the sale of revenue bonds but he didnt have enough wisdom when asked about it to give a firm answer he said he believed he would have that wisdom on friday the governor also commented on his plan to police andor fine business establishments that keep their lights on after business hours he said he would announce a finalized plan on or around mar one five a specific program to reduce by five zero seven zero the amount of energy used by retailers afterhours the governor did outline the legislative package designed to promote renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration through incentives rebates and tax credits the package contains one rebate increase bill emerging renewable resources account of the renewable resource trust fund five zero million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than one zero kilowatts this money will come from the general fund two tax credit bill sb one seven x brulte a five zero tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than one zero kilowatts and up to two zero zero kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses three renewable energy loan guarantee program ab five three x reyes five zero million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities four retrofitting of distributed generation facilities this proposal will provide two zero million to achieve four zero mw of reduced peak load through retrofitting of natural gas distributed generation units at municipal water districts to improve environmental performance this involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology five legislation to exempt microgeneration and renewable facilities less than one mw from standby charges elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the investor owned utilities this includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt please find the text of the governors press release for this news conference below for immediate release zero two one four two zero zero one two zero zero pm governor davis announces bill package to increase renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration sacramento governor gray davis today announced a legislative package to provide incentives to power up more renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration to help meet californias energy challenge by investing in renewable energy sources clean distributed generation and cogeneration we can increase our energy supply without taking power away from the grid governor davis said my generation plan contains the most ambitious renewable energy program in the nation distributed generation and cogeneration are powerful tools for meeting californias power needs these types of facilities reduce demand on the state power grid they also provide energy independence from the independent systems operator and the volatile spot market advanced technology that creates jobs as well as power and reliable energy sources that respect the environment governor davis legislative package for distributed generation cogeneration and renewable energy includes one five zero million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than ten kilowatts two a five zero tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than one zero kilowatts and up to two zero zero kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses this will be carried in sb one seven x by senator jim brulte rcucamonga three five zero million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities this will be carried in ab five three x by assemblymember sarah reyes dfresno four two zero million for retrofit of distributed generation owned by municipal water districts to improve environmental performance this involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology five elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the investor owned utilities this includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt the davis administration will work closely with legislators to pass legislation to implement these proposals cogeneration is the simultaneous generation of electricity and heat or steam usually on an industrial site typically the electricity is sold to the grid and the heat or steam is used onsite in the industrial process distributed generation is a term used for a decentralized approach to generating electricity generally the electricity is generated on the site where it is being used it can include renewables such as solar or wind power fuel cells and microgenerators governor davis made his announcement at the uc davis medical center cogeneration plant in sacramento the plant supplies not only all of the electricity for the but all of the heating and cooling for the uc davis medical center it produces two six mw of power since the medical center needs less than half of that the excess power is sold back to the iso which pays the centers utility bills the uc davis medical center cogeneration plant is a selfsufficient facility governor davis added it is an efficient facility it is a clean facility and it is the kind of facility that we need a lot more of to meet our peak energy demands governor davis energy plan relies on three elements stabilization conservation and generation the governor is working with legislative leadership on a stabilization plan for the states investor owned utilities over the last several weeks governor davis unveiled an aggressive plan for energy conservation that will help reduce demand and keep costs down and a plan to dramatically increase the supply of produced and sold in california,14:59:00,No

recommendations to promote two one st century energy conservation expand combined heat and power projects because of their large needs for both heat and electricity businesses find combined heat and power chp systems particularly attractive however replacing old inefficient boilers with highly efficient chp systems can add a number of new regulatory requirements such as air permits without offering the same depreciation incentives the tax code grants to power plants recommendations one direct the secretary of treasury to work with the secretary of energy and congress to encourage increased energy efficiency through combined heat and power projects by shortening the tax depreciation life for chp projects to seven years two direct the administrator of the environmental protection agency to work with local and state governments to encourage the use of welldesigned chp and other clean power generation at brownfields sites consistent with the local communities interests epa will also work to clarify liability issues if they are raised at a particular site three direct the administrator of the environmental protection agency to promote combined heat and power through flexibility in environmental permitting to the extent permitted by law provide incentives for hybrid fuel cell vehicles hybrid vehicles use power electronics and battery storage to get more out of every gallon of gasoline consumed and provide the ability to double vehicle mileage a recent national energy laboratory report indicates that the fuel economy of a typical automobile could

by the department of energy doe and the epa energy star is awarded only to appliances that significantly exceed minimum energy efficiency standards the energy star program does not extend to all products energy efficiency would be further promoted if the energy star program were expanded to a broader range of products recommendations one direct the secretary of energy to promote greater

 RABLE FOR ALL",california situation clarity improving most likely outcome favorable for all while we do not expect a direct rate increase or removal of the rate freeze for eix or pcg out of the california public utility commission meeting today we are encouraged by the conciliatory tone of recent comments in our view acerbic rhetoric has finally given way to pragmatic reconciliation and it now appears that california utilities are on the path towards effectively receiving the rate increases they require to remain solvent we believe this has implications not only for the health of the affected utilities but also for the growth energy merchants and competitive generators while the credit risk associated with utilities power market purchases have not been solved yet the credit risk in the california market has eased somewhat while trading may be choppy as the final california remedy is hammered out we recommend the purchase of the growth energy names throughout any nearterm weakness possible as a result of the process decision expected today at four zero zero pm est ca situation improvingone two two one zero zero pdf raymond c niles powernatural gas research salomon smith barney two one two eight one six two eight zero seven raynilesssmbcom s raymond c niles powernatural gas research salomon smith barney two one two eight one six two eight zero seven raynilesssmbcom s ca situation improvingone two two one zero zero pdf,07:09:00,No

draining for me around here im going to forward some of my recent email communications to catch you up on the issue after youve had a chance to take in the situation i would really love to hear your opinion call or email with any insights susan susan m scott zero nine two one two zero zero zero zero two three eight pm to ehillegeisthotmailcom cc subject we have closure well sortof im soooo good the chosen path was cool indifference so last night was steak night and with nick and wilson both in town we had a really good showing i got there about seven three zero with nick and the groups size swelled to about one two by eight three zero nine zero zero about eight zero zero i saw kevin teds pal the one you meet a steak night wandering around lws obviously in search of someone can you believe it he ted knew i had organized this gathering i know that because nick is working right across from he and darren and overheard darren encouraging teds attendance mind you ted was not in the email distribution and he had the nerve to come anyway kevin saw me and came over to chat he informed me that our friend ted should be there shortly to which i responded you would know better than me at this point the subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again he asked if ted and i parted on good terms bad terms etc i said there really werent any terms i just hadnt heard a peep out of him for about two weeks kevin wanted to know if i was going to break a bottle over teds head and cause a big scene when i said no i think he was genuinely disappointed i said in order for me to do something like that i would have to care about the loss and that while a week or two earlier i might have cared a bit more with each passing day the loss seems less and less like much of a loss kevin told me i was betteroff without ted to go even further he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of his date ted nor any of his girlfriends he said that while he thought ted was a great guy ie fun to be around good stories etc he wasnt good dating material i agreed with kevin saying ted is a great guy he just makes a lousy man dont you like that one i then went on to say anyway im destined for bigger and better things right kevin much bigger and much better about this time my parents showed upthe plot thickens i introduced kevin to my parents and since both my dad and kevin were in the navy and attended colorado they had much to talk about the two of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when dumdadumdum ted shows up he approaches our group because he sees kevin and is forced to make eyecontact with me i give him a hey and he gives me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant hows it going he asked what kevin and my dad were talking about i told him the navy he said dont get kevin started or youll never shut him upthen he walked away he never acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the evening the beautiful thing is kevin stays and talks with my dad for another half hour and when darren shows up he hangs out with my group for quite a while before going to join ted my parents and i ate our steaks right behind ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table when we were finished it really was a great night i would almost say i was glowing i was having so much fun with my friends and family and it wasnt a show for teds benefiti really was having a great time so when my parents decide to head out they walked over to tedkevins table to say goodbye to kevin it was awesome teds sitting right next to kevin while kevin and my dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in his chair yet again no acknowledgement of my parents he couldnt even make eyecontact i ended up staying there for at least another hour and then went with a few of the guys to the ale house needless to say i was very hung over today anyway theres the storyhes a complete and utter asshole so im done and no there is no way he could weasel his way back in to my good graces now on to a fun subject my trip to london i bought my ticket today i think i got hosed a little bit but it was the

 - Section 390",marks synopsis pretty well says it all once again the cpuc is in a panic and is attempting to change the rules in the middle of the game im not sure i can make as clear a connection as mark has between the actions of interstate pipelines particularly transwestern who basically are allowed to charge just a tariff rate for upstream transport and the huge dislocation of basis spread between producing area and california border therefore i dont necessarily see us being sullied by the el paso issue i think our biggest pr problem is probably our affiliation with enron online well continue to monitor this situation one thing is clear fireworks will certainly be forthcoming when the qfs are being paid on a formula weighted predominantly with basin pricing rather than border prices not to be be too esoteric here but remember there are a number of factors at play qfs by contract are obligated to produce electricity when called on they are paid capacity payments by the utilities for that purpose it will be interesting to see how many of the qfs tell edison pge sdge et al to go fly a kite when they know that if they produce a mw of electricity their commodity

almost anything to stem the tide of higher energy prices their latest manifestation of complete meltdown comes in the form of attempting to modify electric qf payments by abandoning the current gas index methodology utilized by all three utilities essentially the proposed decision wouldimmediately effective one two one abandon the old california border gas indexes in favor of adopting a proxy gas price this new proxy gas price would apply to all three utilities pge sce and sdge on a temporary basis the gas index used for eventual electric qf payments will be an gas index consisting of i one zero of the simple average of three border indices at topock btu daily ngi natural gas week and ii nine zero of the socal gas core wacog published monthly in schedule gcs or in the case of pge nine zero of their core published wacog the resultant reduction in electric qf payments is several hundreds of millions of dollars just for december alone so what if anything does this mean to tw clearly tws short term desk maybe be affected if cal border numbers run one four two zero dollars and power payments are based upon pge wacog of seven five zero gas demand for electric generation will moderate next the heat level on the cause of why basin to border price spreads are over one zero is not longer just a commission vs epng issue the entire california qf population becomes a huge

affairs date august three one two zero zero one re august two zero th joint legislativeregulatory affairs meeting on reliability legislation summary of epsa position exploration of future initiatives the august two zero th meeting on august two zero th the epsas legislative and regulatory affairs committees met to review and discuss existing proposals on reliability legislation dave nevius of nerc explained the current draft of the socalled stakeholder consensus bill and bobby lamb presented the competing proposal being advanced by pjm after these presentations nevius and lamb responded to numerous questions thereafter epsa members discussed the relative merits of the two proposals concluding with a straw poll indicating support for exploring an alternative to nercs bill specifically epsa members expressed general dissatisfaction with the new streamlined version of the nerc bill additionally serious doubts exist regarding the possibility of revising the language in the nerc bill in any way that would make it acceptable general observations about the fundamental aspects of the nerc bill indicated that people are not comfortable shifting authority away form ferc to an overly complex prescriptive organization with uncertain delegations of enforcement authority to regional entities apparently successors to existing regional reliability councils regarding alternatives there was consensus that the general approach contained in the pjm proposal subject to additional work to resolve several weaknesses could become an acceptable vehicle for addressing reliability issues while epsa members clearly are leaning toward the pjm bill the proposals raises serious questions concerning one the states role regarding adequacy and their right to adopt more stringent standards based upon compelling need even if inconsistent with national standards and two limited provision for coordination with canada and mexico the pjm proposal pjms proposal contains a number of positive aspects including its simplicity it is only five pages long members and staff on capitol hill have repeatedly pleaded for a shorter version of reliability legislation the pjm proposal is at least one zero pages shorter than the nerc bill ferc and the rtos would have primary jurisdiction over development and enforcement of reliability standards the nerc language gives substantial deference to the ero in all likelihood nerc reformed in ways that are not yet clear or certain and accompanying arres successors to the regional reliability councils eisb with the expected approval of the formation of eisb at the upcoming meeting of the gisb board on september one nine th coupled with strong support from ferc commissioners wood brownell and massey the pjm proposal allows an opportunity to incorporate eisb the nerc bill is unclear how an eisb would be accommodated if at all some issues raising concern which need to be addressed include state role the language contains a savings provision which would defer to each state to enforce standards within their boundaries only through applications from affected parties can ferc review state actions and may delay such state action although it does not specifically state that it can prevent it international issues specifically interfaces with canada and mexico the language expresses the need to establish harmonious reliability standards with each country throughout the north american region while simply instructing ferc to do so pjms proposal may need to more clearly explain how to this would be accomplished variances the nerc language presently allows for interconnection wide variances the wscc favors this approach and the senate energy committee with the bulk of its membership from the west region may have something to say about the lack of ability for a region to request a variance whether or not a compromise can be formulated is something we will need to explore next steps the game plan is to open a dialogue with proponents of the pjm bill in order to discuss how best to improve the language to remove potential obstacles to its attracting wider support while this memo summarizes several key issues there may be others which will need to be discussed please bring these ideas up for discussion during the naero working group conference call scheduled for tuesday september four at two three zero pm edt

rotated off blocks of three five zero zero zero customers for six zero to nine zero minutes at a time after other attempts to reduce demand failed apple considers itself relatively lucky because it was able to keep doing business that day thanks to a contingency plan according to spokeswoman lynn fox whether that backup plan includes buying in alternative electricity or some other means apple wouldnt say what is sure is that as silicon valley expands through the nations most populous state and california shows no sign of quickly resolving its power problem technology firms large and small are among those businesses that stand to suffer financially from lost production time these big power consumers are spending a lot of money to back up their regular electricity sources industry observers said and in some cases that spending may be as much of a bottomline factor as the power outages themselves unreliable power costs the us economy about five zero billion a year said bernie ziemianek of epri a palo alto calif thinktank focused on power issues and technology ziemianek thinks that figure which considers lost productivity and the cost of equipment and products damaged during a power interruption could double in the next three to five years because of the growth of internetrelated activity and electronic commerce mark mills coauthor of the digital power report a trade newsletter believes that cost is already higher because the economy is increasingly dependent on reliable power it is no longer just hospitals and military bases that cant do without uninterruptible power semiconductor makers telecommunications providers and a host of other industries cannot do without fulltime electricity by the end of the decade internetrelated activity and ecommerce could account for about two five to three five of the total us electric demand said raymond james analyst frederick schultz compared with about eight in one nine nine eight the new us economy can scarcely survive the annual power outages and interrupted service problems that have plagued the power grid over the past few years schultz said hot days hot economy and hot debate although the california power outage made headlines across the country rolling blackouts in the state are about as rare as a trafficfree los angeles freeway indeed the state has never declared a socalled stage three emergency which occurs when the statewide power reserve falls below one five and involuntary power interruptions may begin on a wide scale rolling blackouts have been more common in the east coast and the midwest which are two areas that also are susceptible to stormrelated outages while some industry watchers have faulted deregulation for the struggle to meet power demand in california others argue that hot weather and robust economic growth are to blame the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle a year ago californias weather was cooler than usual but this year the state has had a hot summer on june one four the day of the bay area blackout the temperature in san francisco reached one zero three degrees a level not seen for one three five years that spike coupled with overall growth in electricity usage pushed the power grid to its limits over a one zero year period this state will need one zero zero zero zero megawatts of additional energy to keep up with the growth we are seeing now said pge spokesman greg pruett indeed with hot summer weather and new capacity still a long way off the number of stage two emergencies california has declared is on the rise in a stage two emergency power reserves are below five and many utilities begin to contact accounts that have identified themselves as interruptible customers and ask them to reduce their usage by set amounts those socalled interruptible customers are typically commercial and industrial accounts by early august the california independent system operator had declared nine stage two alerts said patrick dorinson a spokesman for the nonprofit agency that manages most of the electricity flow around the state compared with one in one nine nine nine and four in one nine nine eight during a stage two alert interruptible customers agree to cut their consumption when asked in return for lower electricity rates and often help to stave off the need to resort to more serious measures such as rolling blackouts however it can be a doubleedged sword for the commercial customer which can face steep fines if it fails to comply with the order penalties can offset the savings the company stands to gain from the program and thats even before accounting for the cost of lost productivity aerospace and defense giant boeing co ba and technology distributor ingram micro inc im are two companies operating facilities in california under the interruptible customer program during the first week of august each was called upon to reduce its power consumption both companies see the program as a way to act as good members of the community while saving money the manufacturing of a rocket takes two to three years said walt rice a spokesman at boeings huntington beach calif facility the impact of a stage two power reduction is fairly outweighed by the cost savings he said we live in a state where there is a high demand for electricity we are doing things to shed even a small amount of that demand said paul la plante senior vice president of worldwide facilities for ingram micro still company officials admitted compliance isnt without inconvenience companies need to work closely with utilities to determine the number of power interruptions they can tolerate ziemianek said but that determination can be difficult to make for example while a semiconductor plant operator knows a mere brownout can destroy a days production and prepares for this event the operator of a commercial bakery may be unprepared for the disruption a brownout can have on the microchips embedded in its machinery digital power reports mills said companies such as silicon graphics inc sgi and qwest communications international inc qwst are spending more money on systems either to back up replace or supplement the electricity supplied from the power grid than the entire electric industry is spending by a factor of at least five possibly one zero said mills the stakes are too high if you are nasdaq a dotcom or a fab maker he said other power options for that reason companies are trying to be savvier about their power usage earlier this year oracle corp orcl considered going off the power grid entirely by building its own power generation facility a spokeswoman for the redwood shores calif software company wouldnt provide further details of the plans progress this option may seem severe but its one reason why the makers of power turbines are faced with extensive order backlogs and its also driving demand for uninterruptible power supplies such as those manufactured by companies like emerson electric co emr and for new power technologies such as fuel cells flywheels and microturbines some of which are still years away from commercial viability others like silicon energy co are developing products to allow utilities and their customers to better manage their electric consumption silicons software allow its users to track their realtime electricity consumption with this in mind mills suggests that the real financial impact of power interruptions isnt the money companies lose on these events but the value of what companies are willing to spend to cushion the blow of blackouts when they occur by christina cheddar dow jones newswires two zero one nine three eight five one six six christinacheddardowjonescom copyright c two zero zero zero dow jones company

2000-12-20,"[""'rick.bergsieker@enron.com'""]","[""'mike.mcconnell@enron.com'""]",Your Meeting with Oxy,i understand that you will be meeting with dale lawrence and casey olson from oxy on thursday and that terry will be briefing you on the saudi project opportunities first thing thursday am and will be participating with you in the meeting after rereading the saudi proposals today i offer the following thoughts and suggestions for your meeting terry can fill you in on more details background the saudi gas initiative was kicked off by the crown prince during a visit to the us in the fall of one nine nine nine the intent was to encourage foreign investors to bring capital and technology into the country to build a privatized gas power and water infrastructure system and to create jobs and investment opportunities for saudis the initiative is being led by the foreign minister because the crown prince is aware of resistance from aramco the oil ministry saudi electric co and saudi water co in spite of continuing resistance from these very powerful groups the initiative is moving forward essentially on schedule when the initiative was first announced enron tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that we would not qualify because we did not have adequate international upstream expertise at the same time oxy tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that they did not have adequate downstreaminfrastructure expertise oxy approached us to form a partnership which we did in good faith but with no written agreement we still have not signed an agreement with oxy but we have traded many drafts and are within days of executing an agreed mou we have been working together in good faith on orally agreed terms consistent with the draft mou oxy and enron are a good fit because oxy shares many of the enron values urgency bottomline focus objective is money not necessarily booked reserves etc oxy has made it clear that they are primarily interested in upstream investment in saudi and we have made it clear that we are not interested in upstream investment oxy understands the recent changes in philosophy in enron and is ok with this but at the same time they are worried that we may not want to put any capital in saudi and thus could jeopardize oxys competitiveness in the upcoming beauty pageant oxy maintains that throughout the process dr iranis personal friendship with the saudi foreign minister has been a big driving force in moving our proposals forward there is probably some truth to this however at the same time it is clear to both oxy and to enron that the saudi bureaucracy is more intrigued with enron than with oxy and want to find a role for us since all of our presentations to the saudis have been joint oxyenron presentations the saudis view us as linked together this is a huge deal for oxy and the dream of a lifetime for irani they are afraid that if enron drops out which we have the clear right to do the saudis may disqualify oxy i believe that their fears are justifiedi cant imagine the saudis allowing oxy to proceed alone without enron proposed way forward we and oxy have been shortlisted along with several other oil companies for two projects core project two which is an e p opportunity on the red sea coast near jordan combined with a gasliquids processing plant a pipeline a potential powerwater plant and a potential petrochemicals facility the market area on the red sea coast has huge growth potential core project three which is an e p opportunity in se saudi near the uae border combined with a pipeline to eastern saudi a liquids plant and several potential downstream facilities there is the potential to export this gas to the uaedolphin but it is a long shot terry can give you details on both of these proposed projects each of these projects will require several billion dollars of capital and they each have large upstream components the marketing network potential both within saudi and internationally is huge but the dilemma is to carve out a role for enron that fits with our corporate philosophy i understand that dale lawrence has proposed to you that we tell the saudis that oxyenron want to proceed as joint partners and then settle up behind the veil such that the upstream capital and risk are oxy responsibilities i dont like this approach because the press wont see beyond the veil and will report it as enron being a five zero five zero partner in one or two four billion deals in saudi on the other hand i want to be in these projects because the potential in saudi is huge and the egm spinoffs liquids etc could also be huge i believe that there is a simple way to address both our needs and oxys needs the saudi proposals break both core project two and core project three into two pieces an upstream e p and gas processing venture under a traditional psc arrangement with aramco as the controlling partner and the foreign partner as operator and various downstream pipeline power water and potentially distribution companies in which aramco will not be a participant but that other saudi investors may want a piece of these downstream ventures will buy gas from the upstream ventures and will be subject to pipeline and privatisation regulatory regimes that have not yet been invented i suggest that we propose to the saudis that enron and oxy will be working as partners but that oxy will be the sole investor and operator for all upstream components enron on the other hand will undertake to be the developer and operator for the pipelines and downstream facilities but will structure such projects as opportunities for various saudi investors supported by project financing and with ipos as soon as possible in structuring such projects enron would work with the saudi government to develop appropriate regulatory regimes enron as developer and operator would forego the right to any equity in such projects in order to maximize the investment opportunities for saudis but would instead cover its development costs and earn a profit via operating and development fees to the downstream ventures and success fees at financial close andor other milestones this approach would give oxy the hard capital investment in saudi that they want while giving enron the opportunity to earn a return on intellectual capital it would give us the chance that we want for a dialogue with the saudis to define the basis for a robust marketoriented systemsimilar to the opportunity that enron japan hopes to develop through working with the japanese government it would also give us an on the ground relationship with government authorities that control policies for the export and marketing of saudis crudes and liquids we could also offer to be the exporterofftaker for any liquids produced by oxy terry and rob are going to kick this around a bit tonight and may have a more well thought out approach by thursday but i wanted to get these basic thoughts to you to give you terry and rob some food for thought rick,01:04:00,"Yes

the states booming economy taxes the ability to meet electricity demands a federal investigation is underway chris kraul times staff writer aug two eight two zero zero zero los angeles times home edition page aone copyright two zero zero zero the times mirror company with southern californians reeling from skyrocketing electric bills critics charge that fewer than a dozen power suppliers are reaping far greater profits than are justified by the recent surge in wholesale prices of the natural gas they use to create electricity their behavior is a major focus of a formal investigation announced last week by federal regulators among those under scrutiny are power merchants including bdukeb benergyb bdynegyb breliantb benergyb calpine southern co and the los angeles department of water and power critics say the companies are earning huge windfalls selling energy to the two state agencies charged with distributing power in california the power merchants themselves deny any profiteering describing their market moves as legal business practices and welcoming the investigation the underlying cause of californias energy turmoil is a severe shortage of powergenerating capacity to meet the soaring energy demands of the states booming economy this summer the state at times has had to import more than two zero of its energy needs a shortfall equal to the output of about two zero mediumsize power plants no plants of any size have been built in the state in one zero years but the problem goes beyond a supplyanddemand imbalance the socalled merchant power companies ability to bend the market to their advantageusing what appear to be legal strategiesillustrates what many say are serious flaws in the states deregulated energy market one major flaw is that sellers do not have to participate in the states main electricity auctionthe socalled day forward sale held one day before electricity is delivered to the states residences and businesses instead generators are withholding power until the day of delivery when desperate state agencies are willing to pay steep prices to keep the power flowing the upshot has been a doubling of electric bills for the one two million customers in san diego gaselectrics coverage area and southern california edison and pacific gaselectric customers may be facing higher prices once their rates are unfrozen in two zero zero two there is little prospect for shortterm relief with no additional power generation due for a year the prices of natural gas and crude oil are still rising in fact state officials expect the market to become tighter over the next year as demand and fuel prices rise in pointing the finger at the power merchants gov gray davis some academics and utility executives charge that california consumers are being victimized by sophisticated trading techniques that take advantage of the market system to extract huge profits deregulation only works if people act responsibly it wont work if people say their only goal is to make as much money as humanly possible davis said last week this brokering takes place on the california power exchange and the independent system operator two agencies created by the one nine nine six legislation that ostensibly opened up seven zero of the states power marketrepresented by the pge sce and sdge service areasto competition to create that competition lawmakers ordered the utilities to sell power plants to independent companies which now are selling electricity to the state the power exchange is a clearinghouse for the bulk of energy trading that is completed a day in advance of delivery which normally fills most of the states energy needs the iso the nominal traffic cop arranging deliveries over the power grid also has the authority to hold sameday power auctions for immediate delivery in the event of unexpectedly high demand the power exchange is subject to a price cap of two five zero per megawatthour a ceiling imposed earlier this summer as prices began to soar but the iso has the authority to pay as much as it has to for supplementary power if the previousday purchases prove insufficient to keep the states lights on and it is the secondary iso market where power suppliers leveraging a sellers market are holding sway by withholding their energy from the power exchange and opting instead to bid their supply to the iso they are betting that sameday shortages will generate prices as close to the price cap as possible possibly even above it its apparently working on some days the iso has ended up buying onefifth of the states energy needs not the five to one zero maximum originally envisioned in the process desperate to meet demand the iso is paying premium prices and those prices are being passed along to consumers the problem with the market apparently defies easy solutions at an emergency meeting friday to discuss ways of dealing with the crisis the iso board rejected a staff proposal to force energy merchants to allocate at least nine zero of the electricity they intend to sell in the day forward auction held by the power exchange instead of holding back until the day of delivery although iso chief executive terry winter said the measure would restore some market order the board rejected it on fears that it might create unforeseen ramifications possibly even power suppliers abandoning the state altogether as the market stands now independent power companies have been able to exploit the power shortages and the markets quirks to charge the state higher rates than the increases in the price of natural gas would seem to warrant said severin borenstein a uc berkeley professor and energy specialist with fellow uc berkeley professor james bushnell and stanfords frank wolak borenstein studied the power exchange over a one five month period ended in september and found evidence of market power or the power generators ability to raise prices above competitive levels for sustained periods unless there is collusion among two or more power providers the exercise of market power is not illegal experts say but if prolonged it is a symptom of a seriously dysfunctional market i think market power has probably gotten worse this year there are players big enough to move the price and move it a lot prices are clearly way above their costs borenstein said edison ceo john bryson and stephen baum head of sdge parent sempra energy have similar criticisms their claims will be investigated by the federal energy regulatory commission the latest of five probes underway into californias worsening energy predicament well see whether there are alternative market rules that should be adopted to have a better functioning more efficient market said daniel larcamp fercs director of market tariffs and rates looking at market power issues is an important focus of our investigation power suppliers duke energy and calpine denied any market manipulation saying the bulk of their energy is sold on longterm contracts and is not used to unduly sway dayahead prices on the power exchange or sameday sales on the iso no way are we manipulating the market and we have welcomed investigation into our business practices said tom williams spokesman for duke energys california regional office in morro bay its easy to point fingers at someone who controls only four of the market much of which has already been sold in the forward market months ago calpine spokesman bill highlander said the high prices are simply a case of demand far outstripping the states ability to meet it ten years ago you had more supply than demand now you have a skyrocketing demand from population growth a robust economy and internetfed additions to demand highlander said charles cicchetti a usc professor of government business and the economy agrees and said the market is performing exactly as expected given supply shortages he objects to the limited price ceilings opposed by state officials the choice should be to either regulate the whole thing go back to where we were or let the market work cicchetti said this hybrid is causing problems to get worse but something appears to be worsening an already bad pricing situation and critics believe it is market manipulation in the ferc order initiating its investigation the agency noted that californias wholesale electricity costs on june two nine were three four zero milliona sevenfold increase over the same date in one nine nine nine over the same period natural gas prices only doubled ferc will look at other aspects of the states energy deregulation as wellat the fact that utilities have no choice but to purchase power from the central power exchange and have only limited power to hedge or make bilateral deals on their own with outside firms in an interview last week the fercs larcamp said his agency is reserving the right to roll back rates order refunds or even impose a new market framework to replace the power exchange and iso larcamp said the fercs probe will contrast californias troubled power market with the pennsylvaniamarylandnew jersey system which gives end users more freedom to cut their own deals with suppliers the result is that pennsylvania has more than one three zero power suppliers competing for the states business versus no more than one five in california times staff writers nancy vogel

a year ago i became president of the national rifle association which protects the right to keep and bear arms i ran for office i was elected and now i serve i serve as a moving target for the media whove called me everything from ridiculous and duped to a braininjured senile crazy old man i know im pretty old but i sure thank the lord aint senile as i have stood in the crosshairs of those who target second amendment freedoms ive realized that firearms are not the only issue no its much much bigger than that ive come to understand that a cultural war is raging across our land in which with orwellian fervor certain acceptable thoughts and speech are mandated for example i marched for civil rights with dr king in one nine six three long before hollywood found it fashionable but when i told an audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride or red pride or anyone elses pride they called me a racist ive worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life but when i told an audience that gay rights should extend no further than your rights or my rights i was called a homophobe i served in world war ii against the axis powers but during a speech when i drew an analogy between singling out innocent jews and singling out innocent gun owners i was called an antisemite everyone i know knows i would never raise a closed fist against my country but when i asked an audience to oppose this cultural persecution i was compared to timothy mcveigh from time magazine to friends and colleagues theyre essentially saying chuck how dare you speak your mind you are using language not authorized for public consumption but i am not afraid if americans believed in political correctness wed still be king georges boyssubjects bound to the british crown in his

niggardly b didnt know how to use a dictionary to discover the meaning and actually demanded that he apologize for their ignorance what does all of this mean it means that telling us what to think has evolved into telling us what to say so telling us what to do cant be far behind before you claim to be a champion of free thought tell me why did political correctness originate on americas campuses and why do you continue to tolerate it why do you whore supposed to debate ideas surrender to their suppression lets be honest who here thinks your professors can say what they really believe it scares me to death and should scare you too that the superstition of political correctness rules the halls of reason you are the best and the brightest you here in the fertile cradle of american academia here in the castle of learning on the charles river you are the cream but i submit that you and your counterparts across the land are the most socially conformed and politically silenced generation since concord bridge and as long as you validate that and abide it you areby your grandfathers standardscowards heres another example right now at more than one major university second amendment scholars and researchers are being told to shut up about their findings or theyll lose their jobs why because their research findings would undermine bigcity mayors pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers i dont care what you think about guns but if you are not shocked at that i am shocked at you who will guard the raw material of unfettered ideas if not you who will defend the core value of academia if you supposed soldiers of free thought and expression lay down your arms and plead dont shoot me if you talk about race it does not make you a racist if you see distinctions between the genders it does not make you a sexist if you think critically about a denomination it does not make you antireligion if you accept but dont celebrate homosexuality it does not make you a homophobe dont let americas universities continue to serve as incubators for this rampant epidemic of new mccarthyism but what can you do how can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation the answers been here all along i learned it three six years ago on the steps of the lincoln memorial in washington dc standing with dr martin luther king and two hundred thousand people you simply disobey peaceably yes respectfully of course nonviolently absolutely but when told how to think or what to say or how to behave we dont we disobey social protocol that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom i learned the awesome power of disobedience from dr king who learned it from gandhi and thoreau and jesus and every other great man who led those in the right against those with the might disobedience is in our dna we feel innate kinship with that disobedient spirit that tossed tea into boston harbor that sent thoreau to jail that refused to sit in the back of the bus that protested a war in vietnam in that same spirit i am asking you to disavow cultural correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority social directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom but be careful it hurts disobedience demands that you put yourself at risk dr king stood on lots of balconies you must be willing to be humiliated to endure the modernday equivalent of the police dogs at montgomery and the water cannons at selma you must be willing to experience discomfort im not complaining but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me let me tell you a story a few years back i heard about a rapper named icet who was selling a cd called cop killer celebrating ambushing and murdering police officers it was being marketed by none other than timewarner the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world police across the country were outraged rightfully soat least one had been murdered but timewarner was stonewalling because the cd was a cash cow for them and the media were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black i heard timewarner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in beverly hills i owned some shares at the time so i decided to attend what i did there was against the advice of my family and colleagues i asked for the floor to a hushed room of a thousand average american stockholders i simply read the full lyrics of cop killerevery vicious vulgar instructional word i got my one two gauge sawed off i got my headlights turned off im about to bust some shots off im about to dust some cops off it got worse a lot worse i wont read the rest of it to you but trust me the room was a sea of shocked frozen blanched faces the timewarner executives squirmed in their chairs and stared at their shoes they hated me for that then i delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist filth where icet fantasizes about sodomizing two one two year old nieces of al and tipper gore she pushed her butt against my well i wont do to you here what i did to them lets just say i left the room in echoing silence when i read the lyrics to the waiting press corps one of them said we cant print that i know i replied but timewarner _s selling it two months later timewarner terminated icets contract ill never be offered another film by warners or get a good review from time magazine but disobedience means you must be willing to act not just talk when a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself jam the switchboard of the district attorneys office when your university is pressured to lower standards until eight zero percent of the students graduate with honors choke the halls of the board of regents when an eight yearold boy pecks a girls cheek on the playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment march on that school and block its doorways when someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays you petition them oust them banish them when time magazines cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged crazy christians holding a cross as it did last month boycott their magazine and the products it advertises so that this nation may long endure i urge you to follow in the hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that freed exiles founded religions defeated tyrants and yes in the hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men by gods grace built this country if dr king were here i think he would agree thank you attone htm,07:35:00,No
