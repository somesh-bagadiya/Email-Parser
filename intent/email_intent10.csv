internet trading access and electronic trading agreements further to our meeting yesterday please find attached a copy of the internet trading access agreement itaa and the electronic trading agreement eta marked up with my suggested changes from an english law perspective as i mentioned to you yesterday these documents will also need to be considered by the overseas lawyers to see whether there are any overriding local laws which could impact on the use the overseas lawyers have copies of these agreements and will include this in their report i understand that it is envisaged that the itaa will be signed off line and the eta will be posted on the website each person authorised by a counterparty with a password must click through the agreement before commencing trading this will only be done on one occasion we discussed yesterday the risks associated with this approach namely that a counterparty could claim that at the time of entering into the itaa it was not aware of the terms of the eta and therefore could not be bound by it it is clearly important to have certainty that the terms of the eta are enforceable as they contain important terms such as indemnities limitations of liability etc having said that the view might be taken that by entering into the itaa all that has been achieved is that a counterparty receives a password which enable the counterparty to put itself in a position where it must consider the eta before proceeding once the counterparty accesses the website and sees the eta a second contract is made and the itaa and eta must then be read together but only at the time that the counterparty has clicked through the eta i suspect that this is the approach that sullivan cromwell had in mind it is also worth bearing in mind that a counterparty may ask for the eta at the time of entering into the itaa or may be relunctant to click through the eta until they have had internal legal sign off this may delay trading nonetheless i understand that you are keen to proceed with signing the itaa off line and the eta on line and accordingly the attached documents are marked up with that structure in mind as agreed yesterday i have only made changes to the document produced by sullivan cromwell where i think it is necessary for english law purposes or clarification i have the following brief comments on the changes i have made one parties you will see that both documents are entered into by a designated enron entity for itself and on behalf of all enron group undertakings the reason for this is that transactions will actually be made between the counterparty and various different enron entities we therefore need to ensure that such transactions with each of those enron entities are governed by the terms of these documents i note from your email yesterday that it was suggested that we need to list the affiliates or have one entity enter into the transactions i think there may be some confusion here this is not the case i assume that the current enron entities which trade certain commodities with certain counterparties will continue to do so on the website the website will need to be set up in such a way as to achieve this but i assume that this causes no problem as each counterparty will see different pages on the website depending on what password has been inserted the documents now contemplate this two services i have removed the references to services as i am not sure what this means i would have thought that these agreements need to govern the counterpartys access and utilization of the website whether or not they actually carry out any transactions therefore i believe that where the agreement had previously referred to services it can now refer to access and utilization of the website three contract formation i have inserted a short paragraph in clause three of the eta which provides that a transaction will only be executed once enron generates a message of confirmation of the sale and purchase to a counterparty and that any electronic records of enron will prevail i note that sullivan cromwell envisage a document being attached which explains this this is also acceptable four data protection on reflection it will be more appropriate for relevant data protection wording to be on the website itself rather than in the itaa or eta this is because the data protection concerns revolve around data subjects ie living individuals rather than corporate entities such as the counterparty before providing appropriate wording for this could you please let me know what information will be collected by you concerning living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally for example when a password is entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this or can you intentionally or unintentionally obtain that individuals email address or other information on them once they have entered the site you will need to check this with your technical people once you have had a chance to review this perhaps you could let me have your comments i have simultaneously sent this email to my financial regulatory colleagues for their review they may have further comments which we will send onto you as a matter of urgency kind regards andrew wilkinson enronagcdoc enronagmurtf tradingagcdoc tradingagmurtf enronagcdoc enronagmurtf tradingagcdoc

gas competition grows despite sluggish reforms by germana canzi of dow jones newswires zero three zero seven two zero zero one dow jones energy service copyright c two zero zero one dow jones company inc london dow jones the netherlands is emerging as an important testing ground for eu gas liberalization as new trading hubs for competitive shortterm gas supplies from the uk and norway emerge on the belgian and german borders however much remains to be done a group of large energy users and traders is preparing to confront gasunie thursday in a hearing organized by the regulator the main issues of contention are the balancing system which gasunie conducts on an hourly basis the extent to which transport tariffs are costfocused and thirdparty access to storage facilities the emergence of competition in the dutch gas sector is mostly due to the initiative of new market entrants who despite a difficult regulatory environment have managed to develop a market for shortterm gas virtually from scratch if liquidity improves in these emerging hubs the netherlands could become an important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other countries in northwest europe as well as being an important market in its own right however the difficulty of implementing transparent thirdparty access systems in the netherlands and in neighboring germany casts a dark cloud over recent progress in competition since december enron europe ltd uene duke energy corp duk eon ag eon rwe ag grwe and electrabel sa bele have been actively buying and selling gas sourced in the uk the netherlands and norway in a number of hubs between emden in germany and emshaven and oude statenzijl in the netherlands david gallagher head of european gas trading at enron in london estimates that at least one trade a day of around one zero zero zero zero zero therms for a quarterly contract is done at the oude statenzijl hub where the gasunie pipeline system connects to the network of wingas gmbh an important element kickstarting shortterm trading was the sale in december two zero zero zero of a two billion cubic meter a year norwegian gas supply contract to five dutchbased power generators robert van der hoeven head of fuel procurement at electrabel the owner of dutch generator epon said his company uses most of the gas it imports from norway for its plants in the netherlands and trades the rest on a shortterm basis in the oudeemden area this pattern is common to the other dutchbased parties to that contract trading in dutch hubs received a further boost when nederlandse gasunie nv nneg decided after months of wrangling with regulator dte to lower its transport tariffs by six five from january two zero zero one and to unbundle its combined commodity and service tariff the socalled css system from july two zero zero one gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent to prove this it says it has lost three zero of its customers in the eligible market but that figure hasnt changed much since march two zero zero zero small wonder that critics say the switching figure doesnt necessarily indicate an ideal system of thirdparty access according to energy consultants the brattle group around half of the gas used by alternative suppliers goes through the one bcmyear zebra pipeline from zelzate to zeeland which was built by dutch utilities a few years ago precisely because gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms shippers have complained that the hourly system used by gasunie to balance the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network significantly gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites in addition to the capacity and transmission price critics say gasunie has so far failed to unbundle these charges although it agreed to do so in january according to the brattle group another controversial aspect of gasunies tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new pipelines rather than its actual costs the dte is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it competitive bp plc ubp and nederlandse aardolie maatschappij nv operate storage facilities and lease capacity to gasunie through longterm contracts the regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage facilities gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to customers critics say the growth of shortterm trading in the dutch gas market is also inevitably linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the ukbelgium gas interconnector and going towards the eight two bcmayear german market market participants say liquidity at the emden and oude hubs has grown considerably since eon and rwe started trading there earlier this year however the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward thirdparty access there has meant that so far most gas traded in the netherlands has remained there by germana canzi dow jones newswires four four two zero seven eight four two nine

borrow against the promised cash but edison international chief financial officer ted craver admitted the utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it has the two seven billion in hand energy suppliers owed money by edison did not immediately return calls for comment tuesday at least four groups of suppliers have sued edison for millions in unpaid bills going back

pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities sempra energy and pge also sell their transmission lines to california craver said among the things that could delay the deals closing is edisons need to find landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal agreements are being violated by the sale edison would also have to pin down exactly what it would be selling

have also sued for back payments calenergy alone has said it is owed four five million in november and december payments the line sale part of a multifaceted tentative deal with the state that could save edison from insolvency could take anywhere from several months into next year craver said the tentative deal announced by gov gray davis feb two three calls for the state to pay more than twice the book value for edisons lines it also would require edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade and for edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators the suit asserts that price caps

everything to see if we agree on what should be done please tell me if you think the following summary should be modifiedor if its incorrect its my understanding that theres a current interest in sports news ie ncaa finals or the european equivalent as well as a future one it seems that the present interest in european sports news could be met with a patchwork solution of taking public domain sports scores hence my email to arfan and posting them with occasional updateslike the ncaa scores hence amitas email to me in the future phase two we will have constant automatically updated sports scores as well as other news for which we will have a legal arrangement handled in houston that will allow us to carry content globallyand all of these deals must be handled by you and dave samuels in houston hence your email to amita i think louises concern now referring to amitas email to me was that european sportsbefore the phase two launchshould have just as much of an opportunity to be covered as american ones which is why amita has had anna gardiner and now arfan look for news that we could put on the site so for example we should have wimbledon scores online phase two or not even

sports news on the web page dear arfan thanks for all your effort were working on a content deal that will give us as much sports news as we want until we can launch this second phase of enrononline well have to rely on other third party content for general news items as in europe as best i understand it this occasional news will be placed on the site at our discretionjulie ferrara will be responsible for publishing north american content and im responsible for european content so if theres something on that everyones talking about football then we could publish a news item if wed like as for the legal issue i spoke with mark taylor lawyer for enron north america over a month ago and he correct me if im wrong mark seemed to differentiate between public domain content and proprietary content the difference between the two being whether or not you could possibly get the information from any other source i think sports scores is usually in the public domain category so lets keep up the good work and if you want to prepare a possible football related news item lets move towards publishing it always going through the normal channels of course thanks arfan jay enron london eol

including frequent rolling blackouts possible power disruptions in the northeast and tight electricity supplies in the pacific northwest because of the regions severe drought the north american electric reliability council an industrysponsored watchdog organization said in a report tuesday that californias power problems this summer are likely to be worse than even state officials have predicted with two six zero hours of rolling blackouts _ an average of two zero hours a week _ likely because of a power shortfall that could be as much as five zero zero zero megawatts during peak demand periods a megawatt is enough power to serve one zero zero zero homes while most of the country will have enough electricity the councils report also warned of potential problems in the northeast with possible power disruptions if there is a persistent heat wave and in the pacific northwest as well as possibly in texas the new york city area could have blackouts if there are transmission problems on lines into the region the report said while texas has plenty of electricity it should be closely watched because the state is shifting into a retail competitive market in june and consolidating some grid management activities david cook the reliability councils general counsel said there is no magic bullet no single thing to be done that will solve the challenges we face in trying to assure electricity reliability cook said in testimony before the senate energy and natural resources committee in the pacific northwest there is expected to be enough power to meet summer

zero zero one one zero one six am to cash michelle cc zimmermann ashley subject fw child pornography issue michelle i wanted to follow up with some additional information regarding the child porn issue the consensus seems to be that the company does not need to report the child porn if it does not want to the only exception to this is individuals engaged in an electronic communication service or a remote computing service to the public are obligated under four two usc one three zero three two to report child porn to the cyber tip line at the national center for missing and exploited children i looked at the definitions of electronic communication service and remote computing service and the second does not seem to apply although the former could apply the statute appears to qualify both as providing those services to the public so i would not think an email system for employees would apply the definition of electronic communication service is pretty broad though if you want me to investigate this further let me know but i would think we have a good argument that we do not provide these services to the public the child porn statute one eight usc two two five two a covers pornography involving girls under the age of one eight so much porn could be child porn there are enhanced penalties for certain types of child porn and for child porn involving children under the age of one two there is an affirmative defense under the statute if the possessor of child porn destroys it or reports it to a law enforcement agency therefore it seems the best course of action is to destroy anything the company has and there does not appear to be a reporting obligation ashley anonymously called the fbi and the da and their responses are indicated below the information obtained from the fbi and das office is consistent with my recommendations kerry e notestine littler mendelson pc one nine zero zero chevron tower one three zero one mckinney street houston texas

ashley sent thursday august one six two zero zero one four zero zero pm to notestine kerry subject child pornography issue kerry i did a little bit of further research on this issue first as brian king stated simply downloading or making a copy of child pornography for any reasoneven to provide it as evidence to law enforcement is a crime in the us so the client should not attempt to copy it the client should attempt to obtain the url web address and report that information to law enforcement if the client decides to report it second the statute making it illegal to knowingly receive or distribute child pornography through interstate or foreign commerce through any means including by computer or receive or distribute child pornography that has been received or distributed by someone else through interstate or foreign commerce in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states is one eight usc section two two five two a it is not clear whether our client has a duty to report the finding of child pornography on its computer system four two usc section one three zero three two states that whoever while engaged in providing an electronic communication service or a remote computing service to the public through a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce obtains knowledge of facts or circumstances from which a violation of sections two two five two a involving child pornography is apparent shall as soon as reasonably possible make a report of such facts or circumstances to the cyber tip line at the national center for missing and exploited chidlren the number for the cyber tip line is one eight zero zero eight four three five six seven eight depending upon how you read the above paragraph our client might have a duty to report its finding child pornography on its computer system to the cyber tip line despite the fact that it has been unable to determine who put it on there for practical advice i contacted the fbi and a harris county da the fbi duty agent i talked to said that if the company does not know who put the pornography on there they do not have a duty to report it however he suggested that they contact the field office in san juan puerto rico because the office might have certain equipment specialists etc that could assist the client in determining who put the child pornography on the system and further investigating the issue the phone number for the fbi in san juan is seven eight seven seven five four six zero zero zero and if the client calls heshe should just ask to speak to a duty agent and explain what they found and how they found it note there is also a special fbi office that handles crimes against children that offices number is two zero two three two four three six six six additionally the harris county da i talked to was not concerned that it would be some type of spoliation of evidence to destroy the pornography and agreed that it is a crime simply to knowingly receive it but recommended that the client contact the fbi in puerto rico so that they could decide whether they wanted to pursue it before the client destroyed it let me know if you wish me to look

of our claims trading activities focussing on the efforts to settle claims already purchased and with a view towards collecting cash by year end in addition there is a brief summary of the pipeline for two zero zero two that is shaping up if all the stars align we should have a significant portion of our working capital back in by yearend and a number of transactions primed for the first quarter of two zero zero two we have one small live transaction that has been caught up in enrons financial mess it is a deal agreed to with pacificorp to buy a claim for two two five zero zero zero which has an expected sales value of two seven five three zero zero zero zero zero we had prepared a dash for approval to buy the claim but changed tact to avoid processing approvals for any new claims business for the time being instead we are using the option built into our jv agreement which allows our partner grs to fund claims purchases separately if we decline a transaction so rather than have enron fund the purchase and take the risk grs will find an alternative arrangement and share the revenue with us through the jv agreement not an ideal situation especially since this mechanism was intended to handle one off large transactions they liked but we were uncomfortable with nevertheless it keeps us in the business and hopefully sets up a better value for the eventual inclusion of the activity together with other parts of irms business for energy re please note the larger deals in the pipeline with equitas kms and home i want to point out that while calling this a trading business may be a stretch on our part especially if defined in the classic sense of trading a commodity ie the ability to go short first the willingness of equitas and others to give us a sale price to work from is essentially a free put option that creates a synthetic short for us overtime their cooperation should allow us to run a book of business from both perspectives ie going long first when the price is right or going short first by having the sales price agreed in advance with the schemes per original message from blesie brad sent monday november two six two zero zero one one one zero seven am to sekse per cc paterniti jason subject claims trading update and pipeline below is an update of where we are on collecting for the four claims purchased to date and the pipeline for the rest of this year and first part of next status janet wood is finalizing some adjustments to the release documents for the three schemes so that we can use the power of attorney granted to us in the assignments to sign the release on behalf of the insureds the documents will go to the schemes this week kms has agreed to pay us five two k for their share of the four purchsed claims phillips montrose kaiser and mitchell which is just slightly one less than what we asked for they are ready to sign for phillips now once the document tweaking above is finished and are awaiting a few more bits of paper on the other three so we will sign phillips as soon as the release language is agreed and the others hopefully this week or next so we should have the funds in by yearend pro has agreed phillips and is willing to let us sign the release document prevsiously sent to phillips but as noted above we need to modify the document somewhat and put grss name on it i dont know for sure how long they will take to turn docs but next this week or next is possible w funds again by the end of the year they have almost all the documentation for the other three and seem to be able to turn things around quickly so we should have the other claims accepted and documents agreed win two weeks they have said they can pay on short notice so we should have current payouts on all four claims total of one one mm in by yearend as noted earlier pro has reversed their previous assertion that they are willing to do onetime settlementscommutations we are working to get this changed and understand why they have done it since it is obviously bad news the existing deals look fine even w this development except phillips which ends up w a gross margin of about one zero which is obviously unsatisfactory these figures are wo the benefit of omnis pricing however which has been promised for wednesday there are various ways to manage around this development but the first choice is to get the policy changed the administrator for oic and ea two of the three companies managed by omni has promised pricing for wednesday which will go a long way towards nailing down valuations they have a slower processing time than the other schemes three to five months officially but generally one to two in practice but are potentially willing to negotiate price and pay before their process is done w a part of the proceeds held in escrow in case their calculation of gross settlement amount differs from ours we will also hear this week their proposal for how this would work but they have said we should be able to get funds by yearend the administrator for andrew weir the other company managed by omni is working on pricing also and promised it for this week or next he is subject to the same time constraint as oicea noted above but is willing to give us all or most of the current payout before omni finishes its work so we should have that seven zero zero k in by yearend as well assuming all of the above works as planned we should have all funds recovered by year end except the tails of pro seven zero zero k and andrew weir two zero zero k and whatever haircut or escrow amount oicea want to hold back pending final calculation of gross settlement amount pipeline this is a snapshot of the pipelineopportunities unless otherwise noted assume gross margins of three zero the last four items illustrate that the markets we are selling to are increasingly willing to give us a number up front on claims that they have been unable to settle which removes much of the uncertainty regarding valuation and makes our origination efforts more focused pacificorp two two five k price agreed hercules close to agreement on one two mm price dupont negotiating price of approximately one five mm owens illinois negotiating price of approximately three seven five mm burlington santa fe negotiating price of approximately one four mm home insurance is working up numbers on all or part of a portfolio that we can purchase from their insureds for seven five mm equitas has identified six claims for which they will pay us one two mm for the solvent piece alone upside would be the difference between that figure and what we can buy them for plus everything that can be recovered from the schemes kms has given us numbers up front that they will pay for their piece of foster wheeler and ppg negotiating now w insureds equitas has given us a number of one zero zero mm for kaiser aluminum and kms has given us a number of two zero mm negotiating w kaiser to try and obtain purchase price of one two zero mm so all value sold to other schemes in excess of five mm would be upside,05:45:31,No

sent monday november two six two zero zero one one zero three one am to truorangeaolcom subject true orange november two six two zero zero one part two of four part two game quotes we actually had an aggie block wed worked on it all week but it wasnt working so we went back to our regular block ande i just had to beat the guy in front of me when i saw it was a linebacker i knew he was in trouble linebackers arent quick enough to block me if i cant get by a big old guy like that i dont deserve my scholarship longhorn cornerback rod babers who blocked the punt that resulted in uts firstquarter touchdown we were both on the right side he and babers and they werent zone blocking like we do they were in manforman and all we had to do was beat the guy in front of us thats my first touchdown as a special teams player texas wide receiver tony jeffery who scooped up the ball babers blocked and ran it in for the games first touchdown we did a good job against the run i thought maurice gordon probably played as good as hes every played for us their center allbig one two seth mckinney is a good ball player and at times he couldnt block him i thought all our guys played pretty well today this was a good oldfashioned football game with both teams playing good defense and a break or two deciding the outcome ut defensive coordinator carl reese we felt like if we would just hang in there and hang in there wed eventually get the running game going and cedric benson and the offensive line did a great job in the fourth quarter with cedric you dont have to abandon the running game because you know hell break loose sooner or later we didnt want to take too many chances and give them a short field because we knew they would have a hard time making a long drive with our defense playing so well texas defensive coordinator greg davis it never got easier but it did get better i think our linemen finally wore them down and i started getting a little more room it would have been nice to get one zero zero zero yards but winning the game is the main thing and we did that texas running back cedric benson give the longhorns some credit their defense is really good it ranks with any we have seen this year am quarterback mark farris the game was up for grabs in the fourth quarter they just made some plays it was seven seven and they did what they had to do in the fourth quarter to go up

time saturday at seven pm in irvings texas stadium in the big one two conference championship game it will be televised nationally by abc and it should be a good one texas is an eight point favorite the longhorns mauled the buffaloes four one seven on oct two zero in austin but that colorado team bore little resemblance to the one that hung a six two three six lashing on no one ranked nebraska saturday for starters bobby pesavento who passed for two zero two yards against nebraska got his first start against texas and he looked like a firsttime starter he was a poised confident sharpshooter saturday against nebraska the perfect complement for the buffs power running game that produced three eight zero yards and eight rushing touchdowns against the proud blackshirt defense of nebraska sophomore chris brown scored a school record six rushing touchdowns while rushing for one nine eight yards he had two six yards against texas in october colorado is nine two its only losses were two four two two in the season opener with fresno state and the one at texas the nine victories were four one one four over colorado state five one one five over san jose state two seven one six over kansas one six six over kansas state three one two one over texas am two two one nine over giantkiller oklahoma state three eight two four over missouri four zero two seven over iowa state and of course the big one over nebraska texas won the first game against colorado by using four firsthalf turnovers to take a two four seven lead and force the buffaloes the abandon their running game and try to play catchup in that game colorado had two four four yards offensively in the first half but was stymied by a fumble at the ut four on firstand goal a fumble at the cu two one that set up a texas field goal and another fumble at the buff three five that set up another ut touchdown unless history repeats and the horns force more early turnovers this game will be a terrific challenge for texas i think there are three keys to a ut victory one win the turnover battle again two keep balance between running and passing but challenge the buffs suspect pass defense frequently three slow

touchdowns and freshman rb cedric benson had two three carries for one zero zero yards and two touchdowns the longhorn defense gave up two four four yards in the first half but forced four gameturning turnovers coachs corner coach mack brown has told his team and longhorn fans all season that good things happen to teams who keep winning after a midseason loss to oklahoma the longhorns have reeled off six straight wins and oklahoma states stunning upset of oklahoma saturday gave texas the big one two southern division title obviously he said we are excited about it because it proves to our guys that when people questioned whether their season was over after the oklahoma game that it wasnt they realized that what they needed to do was take care of their business and there might be some good things that happen at the end our team couldve taken the missouri game or the baylor game for granted but they didnt they took care of their business every week they didnt worry about the bcs and now theyve got themselves in position for a championship game for the second time in three years we are really really excited i am proud of our team and of the way they played at college station what an awful thing it would have been if we had not taken care of business friday in college station and this would have happened ous loss saturday so give credit to our team for being mature playing hard and putting themselves in position to have a rematch with colorado he also said the longhorns four one seven victory over colorado in austin back on october two zero means little because this isnt the same colorado team we played at midseason any team that can get six two points against nebraska gets your attention he said i think it is obvious that colorado is a great football team they are running the ball as good as anybody in the country right now what a great challenge it will be for our defense which has played as good as any defense in the country he said that will be a great matchup brown said the longhorn offense had a tough day against am we will need to play better on offense in this game and what a great challenge it will be to try to stop colorado from running the ball as well as they ran it against nebraska he said brown also said saturdays game is huge because it is for the big one two championship you always want to win your conference championship he said it is one of your first goals each year this is our second opportunity to win a conference championship in four years here and are we excited the bcs is not an issue today and a bowl game is not an issue today he said this is what you fight to get into but when you get there youve got to win after that you try to look up and figure out where you are but brown said beating colorado again is a huge challenge for the longhorns if our guys werent convinced before the nebraska game we will convince them that this colorado team is different he said give colorado coach gary barnett credit he took his kids to texas stadium this summer and said that is where we want to end up and as of saturday nobody thought that colorado and texas would end up in this ball game so give both teams credit brown said it is two teams that have been down this year and have gotten themselves back up gone back to work and are playing as well as anyone in the country at the end of the year one of the things that we have talked about with this team is respect you need to respect yourself and your teammates but you also need to respect your opponent every saturday has to be a real important game for us and a really exciting game for us our guys will play hard this saturday because they understand what is at stake to win the conference championship in this league brown said you have to beat the same team twice a lot of the time that is something that is just there to be the champion you have to do it so we are excited about it there is no question that it is harder because they will have a lot of motivation coming in but we are also going to have a lot of motivation coming in to try to be the champions of the big one two he said the players and coaches are excited about the challenge this is a championship game week he said you understand that this is like playing your biggest rival and that makes it fun what we have to do to win the championship every year is play a huge rival like texas am and then play this game the next week we need to get used to that there are a lot of things that are different now in the big one two that they were around here for a long time with the southwest conference one of them is being able to play big game after big game and especially at the end of the year we have been here before but we havent taken the other step yet this is the week for us to take the other step and win the championship our players are the reason why we are here different things have happened throughout the year and this was just the latest one the reason we are playing in this game is our assistant coaches and our players have worked really hard to take advantage of every opportunity that they have had since the oklahoma game they never got their head down and still believed they kept themselves in a position to win if the opportunity came up brown had planned a big recruiting push this week but said we will put our recruiting on hold all of the coaches could go out on monday for the first time and be in schools and the homes but the players out there will understand that our recruiting will be better by winning the championship game,08:54:55,No

the last paragraph on power plant plans lorna duke stands by california market in the midst of much uncertainty surrounding californias power situation duke energy north america monday reiterated its commitment to the states struggling wholesale electricity market announcing new bilateral power deals with pacific gas and electric co and progress with redevelopment plans at three coastal power plant sites it is operating duke is committed to continue playing a major role to help california address its electricity shortfall and the high prices many felt this summer said bill hall dukes vice president for the western region in north america noting that brownfield projects in california have turned out to be more difficult than new plants to site based on dukes experience over the last three years in response to questions hall acknowledged that duke is constantly reassessing its position in california and a return by the state energy officials to a costbased regulated market would cause him a lot of concern but he is confident at this point that for the longterm market solutions will be applied he said in his meetings with state political and regulatory leaders he is convinced they know the state cant turn back to a traditional commandandcontrol regulatory structure and they recognize that multiple solutions are needed including balancing supplydemand for power we believe that new generation coming on line throughout the west in the next few years will lessen the market volatility and markets will begin to react based on supplydemand stability hall said both halls and dukes western trading executive nancy deschane said they are very anxious to see what the federal energy regulatory commission releases wednesday with its initial draft decision on what it will do to address california wholesale electricity prices including whether it intends to extend the california independent system operators calisos authority to impose price caps hall said duke has signed a series of substantial longterm wholesale electricity contracts with pges utility that will help stabilize the price volatility for the distributors retail customers he would not disclose the terms of the deal including the volumes and duration but said the supplies are slated to be received in the states northern zone npone five earlier duke offered california utilities fiveyear deals at five zero mwh dukes salt lake citybased trading arm is doing the deal rather than its californiabased generation plants meaning the power could come from sources inside or outside of the state hall said duke has begun work with local city officials in the san diego suburb of chula vista to accelerate the current schedule for replacing the south bay power plant which duke leases with an option to buy we hope within the next year well be able to announce what we can do to expedite the replacement of this facility he said following approvals from the state and a local water permit last week duke will begin its five zero zero million modernization of moss landing power plant along the north central coast within the next three zero to six zero days hall said the upgrade will add one zero six zero mw to the sites current one five zero zero mw capacity and will require a three zero four zero increase in the plants natural gas requirements which pges gas utility assures can be handled by the existing pipeline infrastructure weve had discussions with pge and were obviously concerned that we have sufficient infrastructure to transport gas that we purchase into the system hall said were confident that their infrastructure can support moss although he added that statewide we certainly have concerns about the gas infrastructure and duke is working with state officials to assure there are adequate gas supplies we had some problems this summer in southern california and san diego gas and electric recently announced it is going to begin an intense look at what needs to be done to upgrade its gas pipeline infrastructure to support the new generation plants coming on board salt lake citybased deschane said duke has a balanced portfolio of supply and storage contracts noting that she thinks her company has a very strong physical position in the west for gas and the trading unit will be working over the next couple of years to assure that the gas position is sustained and continues to grow down the central coast about eight zero miles at morro bay duke has resubmitted revised plans for totally replacing the one nine five zero sera power plant in a renovation that will build a new six zero zero million one two zero zero mw plant with prompt state approvals hall said duke could bring the new plant online by the summer of two zero zero three and demolish the existing one zero zero zero mw plant by two zero zero seven adding that pge cannot deliver additional gas supplies so the added output is a product of the anticipated improved efficiency of the new

but he is an avid student of politics for understandable reasons he has given especially close scrutiny to the lessons of his fathers presidency and what went wrong to deny him a second term in one nine nine two the results can be seen in the current chief executives adamant support of the large tax cut on which he campaigned he knows that his dads retreat from his no new taxes pledge cost him vital conservative support the younger bush is also the opposite of the elder in emphasizing education bush i did little or nothing to change the schools bush ii put them at the top of his agenda just as the voters persistently do but the most costly error in political terms that bush i made was refusing to consider any shortterm fixes for the economic slump that began in the third year of his presidency when the jobless rate began to edge up treasury secretary nicholas brady counseled bush against any stimulus measures saying that market forces would be enough by themselves to keep the recession short bradys advice brought no comfort to the republican politicians on capitol hill who were picking up bad vibes from their constituents vice president dan quayle who was on the gop fundraising circuit in one nine nine one expressed his frustration that brady was blocking even modest shortterm measures history has recorded that brady was right the recession was short and recovery as measured by the statisticians actually began before the one nine nine two election but that did not spare the incumbent president from charges of indifference to persisting unemployment and bill clinton was elected on a promise to pep up the economy the current bush has accepted congressional changes in his tax plan that will apply shortterm stimulus to a sluggish economy but on the energy problems that began on the west coast and have swept across the country bush ii is as scornful of shortterm fixes as his father was a decade ago this week the administration is releasing its energy plan crafted by a task force under vice president dick cheney in an atmosphere of growing crisis even before summer has arrived california is experiencing rolling blackouts oregon and washington have sacrificed the salmon runs to save river water for hydroelectric power midwest gasoline prices have surged past two a gallon and natural gas prices are skyhigh everywhere when i spent a weekend at rocky mountain college in montana earlier this month i was astonished to learn that even in that energyexporting state the first phase of deregulation has sent prices soaring and made energy the hottest issue in the face of all this cheney and bush have refused to consider temporary price caps on electric power or any other shortterm fix that violates freemarket principles the complex of production incentives and conservation measures that make up the energy strategy is designed to bring supply and demand into balance over the next several years not to provide immediate relief that may be sound economics but it leaves congressional republicans as nervous as their counterparts were one zero years ago rep tom davis the able virginian who heads the national republican congressional committee told me last week that he is hearing more worries from his colleagues about energy prices than about the overall economy we can stand one bad summer davis said but if were facing the same thing next summer weve got problems davis said he had communicated his partys concerns to the white house do they get the message i asked no he said they think in fouryear terms we think in two that comment reflects a reality that few politicians are as candid as davis in acknowledging much as the members of one partys congressional wing may hope for a president of their own party who will sign the bills they pass and help them raise money for their own campaigns owning the white house creates dilemmas the basic political strategy is always set by the presidents people and naturally enough they think about creating favorable conditions for the year in which he will run for reelection they can be more patient and more oblivious to shortterm problems than those who are focused on the battle for the house and senate republicans like tom davis remember that eight years ago when the democrats controlled both the white house and congress it was clintons policy decisions on taxes trade guns and health care that left his party so vulnerable that democrats lost both the house and senate in one nine nine four thats the risk republicans are facing now and thats why theyre nervous two

energy policy i once again urge him to confront the energy elephant in the middle of the room the outofcontrol wholesale prices of electricity in california and across the west in one nine nine six california ventured headlong into a flawed scheme to deregulate electricity although californians were promised lower rates and plentiful supply both predictions have turned out to be disastrously wrong we have now seen our first statewide rolling blackouts since world war ii unheardof wholesale prices for power have bankrupted our largest utility threaten to bankrupt the second largest and have begun to seriously affect our economy if we dont get the situation under control it could quickly threaten our national economy california bears some fault for the current situation in addition to the botched deregulation plan centermost was our failure for the one two years before i took office to build any major power plants but my administration has moved quickly to remedy that by streamlining the permitting process for generating facilities in the past two years my energy commission has licensed one four new major power plants nine are under construction and four will be on line this summer or fall nearly a dozen more are in the pipeline in addition weve approved six new peaker plants to meet this summers demand were moving at unprecedented speed to deal with the supply problem the state however has absolutely no jurisdiction over the wholesale prices being charged by the unregulated mostly outofstate generators that purchased the utilities power plants as part of deregulation since the federal power act was passed in one nine three five price regulation has been the exclusive domain of the federal government but the bush administration and the federal energy regulatory commission have consistently refused to carry out their statutory obligation to ensure energy prices are just and reasonable to the contrary the freemarket ideologues in the administration argue that uncontrolled market prices are needed in order to increase the supply of electricity in other words if we dont allow power generators to shoot the moon on prices they wont have sufficient incentive to build additional supply thats as ridiculous as saying we need to pay dairies three zero zero a gallon to motivate them to produce milk in fact i have joined my fellow governors in oregon and washington in proposing temporary costbased pricing that would still allow generators and marketers a healthy profit but without bankrupting the system last week however vice president dick cheney told the los angeles times that he would remain philosophically opposed to any federal intervention on wholesale power prices even if it threatened the national economy with all due respect to the vice president that is one of the most irresponsible statements ive ever heard here is the eyepopping result of the federal governments rigid stance in the spring of two zero zero zero a megawatt of electricity in california cost an average of three zero by last december after the federal energy regulatory commission precipitously removed the hard price cap of two five zero per megawatt hour that been in effect the spotmarket price shot up to one five zero zero for the same megawatt of power just last week we paid an astounding permegawatt record of one nine zero zero to houstonbased reliant energy for the last one zero zero megawatts of power we needed to keep the lights on the macro result of this unconscionable price gouging is predictable and scary in one nine nine nine california power users paid approximately seven billion for all electricity consumed last year that figure shot up to two seven billion this year estimates are that total spending on electrical power may hit five zero billion to six zero billion the california independent system operator the states electric grid manager has estimated in a report to the federal energy commission that electricity overcharges during the past year have totaled more than six billion even the federal commission itself has formally ruled that the electricity market in california is dysfunctional and that prices charged have been unjust and unreasonable where is that money going simply put into the pockets of the generators and marketers almost all of them in the south and many of them located in texas it is one of the most massive transfers of wealth from the consumers of one state to companies located in another region of the country in our nations history but other than ordering a pittance in limited refunds none of which has yet been returned to the state the federal energy regulatory commission has stood fast in its opposition to real price caps the day before president bush was sworn in he stated on national television that the energy problem here was californias to solve well we are moving aggressively to do our part to get it under control on both the generation and conservation fronts but without just and reasonable prices for wholesale power the crisis inevitably will spill over and damage the alreadysluggish national economy that mr president not only will be your problem it will affect every one of us californians are demanding action we are doing our part leading the nation in building power plants and in aggressive conservation the federal government must do its part to temporarily control runaway energy prices in the west until we can bring on line the major new power plants california has approved the writer a democrat is governor of california two zero

excess capacity from the san juan basin to california marathon and phillips have joined in the protest attacking the entire deal as anticompetitive the protesters hope ferc will force el paso to begin again with capacity assignments amoco and burlington had already protested the deal two weeks ago at ferc when they claimed the sale would violate el pasos rate case settlement and tariff the shippers argue that el paso was trying to sell part of that primary firm capacity at delivery points other than pgetopock which the settlement prohibits the settlement was intended to protect pge and allow it to access service if this capacity is delivered at other points such as socaltopock it could add to the glut at that point the protesters argued el paso and enron stand to gain if the basis differential between the san juan basin and california remains large marathon and phillips say that enron and el paso can manipulate that basis differential because between them and their affiliates

and itis not one of the usual defined terms dont know how its used here suggest you decline andmake them clarify lol issues one i suppose that this is a ny law contract i do not think you can effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct in ny regardless of choice of law we generally cannot get this limited or excluded in contracts with owners either i think you should not accept any ge attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or otherwise and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any to the fullest extent permitted by law clause or other such stuff as a compromise it will be important every time we wrap the ge equipment two generally i do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity for haz mat patents etc three they have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity for all third party losses includes third party consequentials when brian or whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with

engeldorfcorpenronenron sheila tweedhouectect ben jacobyhouectect cc subject ge language im not particularly wild about many of the changes proposed by ge agree seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond here are the issues i see indemnity issues they should indemnify us from claims by their employeessubcontractors kay is your comment in connection with ges comment to section two seven one iii carve out of the one zero zero lol for gross acts of its subcontractors vendors ect ge is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely and totally responsible for the actions and liabilities for its subcontractors and vendors i think section two zero two a as written covers simple negligence of ges subcontractors and vendors and i would argue that we need to keep section two seven one iii as written dealing with gross negligence of ges subcontractors and vendors indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence agree maybe we could agree to ges strike out in two zero two a provided the phrase negligent or willfully wrongful is replaced with negligent at fault or strictly liable without fault or some variation thereof what is a cognizant government dont know this was not discussed with mike so i am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term we need to also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where ge fails to comply with law and instead of enron incurring a monetary penalty is ordered to shut down the facility limit of liability issues they want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws patent infringement liability for haz waste and liens to one zero zero of purchase price they want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence if possible agree see one st comment above re indemnity they dont want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another partys claim for consequentials as in a personal injury claim agree weve dont have anything concrete on

excellent briefing listing several phases of activity she started the session by telling those present that the lack of action at seattle was not a negative on what we need to accomplish this coming year we are on track and need to produce various position papers as early as the end of january articles one nine of the gatt requires that the wto make progress on agriculture and services issues although it does not identify a date certain to achieve agreement ambassador barshefsky is committed to beginning services negotiations beginning in january a committee on specific committments is charged with the responsibility to draft issues the ustr wants to have a definition of issues from the esc by the end of january to be submitted to the usg representatives on the committee a second significant group in the process is the working group on domestic rightsthis group is chaired by peter collins peter needs to know what are the domestic regulatory issues that could be raised by other wto members as reasons not to liberalize various sectors this information is to be supplied in the first half of two zero zero zero in late spring after group one and two have done a significant part of their work the ustr will be deciding what additional principles are needed to be tabled in the negotiation they expect these working groups will begin to meet at the wto by the end of next summer three basic columns headed by one market access two national treatment three additional committments could be proposed annex such as the process tim richards has proposed in our electricity working group listing examples is the format to be developed for the two groups carol advised us that whatever we develop should be with the intention of getting less developed countries ldcs supporting our basic principles in case a multilateral negotiation is not launched we should work the current liberalization process being prosecuted in the apec and ftaa negotiations the next phase of carols presentation addressed the recent response ustr received to the questions they submitted to dg one seven it no longer exisits under the new commission asking the eu to address their feelings about the liberalization of energy services we have not been given a copy of the eu response and carol has asked ms klinkers of the eu if the response can be shared with the esc to secure industry responce carol and others from the usg attending the meeting are trying to ascertain just who drafted the responses which they characterized as confusing and not indicating a real understanding of the current practices and developments in the energy services sector we do know that the usg has called this office to ask how they need to respond to the eu response that electricity is a good and not a service our immediate response is that this is a matter of some disagreement among eu members and the eu staff the movement of electricity across national boundries may be a good but the sale and trading of electricity is definately a service the eu response we were told makes the agrument that in their view that many of the items raised in the october paper of the ustr were gat covered such as construction engineering etc and therefore may not need to be raised in the services negotiations although these items will at least need some sort of annex to make sure they are included the eu believes that if you own or operate electricity producting then its a good but if you operate an ipp to sell electricity to various parties its a service we were told that the eu response does not seem to understand or cover renewables such as wind and solar both of which are important in europes plan to diversify and develop green energy they also believe that pricerisk management should be considered under finance services not energy services the session was then open to general discussion bob fisher commented that the eu does not seem to understand the scope of todays energy services industry that we now have a seemless web of energy services that has been developed what about environmental services again the eu response is confusted and incomplete apparently they feel that environmental services can be considered elsewhere in the negotiation who from the eu drafted this paper the staff has changed and we dont know how high in their heirarchy this was considered carol balassa responded that she is trying to determine who drafted the response brian petty advised that his intelligence is that energy services is being discussed and considered at the highest levels of the commission carol told us that she is trying to get everything together before talking to the eu in january when she hopes to specifically respond and discuss their current returned response therefore she is asking the energy services coalition to complete the work of our four working groups which will allow the hills people to develop the definition and basic negotiating position papers the dos representative then suggested that we engage in somecapacity building this was defined as an outreach program to brief wto member delegations on the meaning of energy services carol suggested that after her january meeting the eu could be agreeable to having our industry group meet with their representatives to explain how energy services has evolved and what is included in energy services we moved to a discussion of the definitions paper itself bob fisher reminded those present that the current matrix developed for the apec process was still an excellent guide to definitions although items such as renewables heating and certain trading and financial services would need to be added to meet some eu concerns that they are not a party to apec and therefore suspicious of any such document we should remove the reference to apec our group pointed to the tim richards paper developed for our electricity working group which gives a broad definition but then contains a footnote known as the illustrative list which lists the various items that we believe constitute energy services under that heading bob fisher said that this was the likely format we would ultimately adopt in the material prepared for ustr and others in the wto process bob said that once negotiators agree on the need for liberalized energy services they can fit whatever they want under the broad definition the last question raised was what happens to the atl accelerated tariff liberalization which also covers some energy matters which wto countries had contemplated being approved in seattle carol said that she did not know the meeting then adjourned the esc needs to complete the working group process and complete the questionaire at the earliest possible time to allow the hills people to prepare the basic document working group chairs are to be asked to complete this process by mid january dear reviewers please review at your earliest opportunity make corrections additions and whatever and return to me for distribution distribution will be to our esc executive committee first and then to our entire membership of four five not to those who have not signed on as members and to usg

attached email string i still think it makes the most sense to have ena enter into the transactions with the hedge funds and thus have the transactions be entered into under the ena isda this assumes of course that one the counterparties are us or bermuda based hedge funds as we discussed yesterday and two the new york or houston office rather than the london office is executing and confirming these transactions we should confirm these assumptions with robyn do you see any reason why this approach would not work for nonenrononline transactions also based on the attached email string it

radous paul lebrocq wendi sharma shifali nelson roderick subject re trades as ena are multiparty isdas a real option this seems like the simplest solution if not i think we are back to the alternatives mentioned below with respect to the spread products i believe there are no spread books as such each risk is laid off to the respective books in this case a good rule of thumb would be to have the spread product offered by ena thus it is ena who contracts with the hedge fund and then ena lays off the relevant risk in the wtibrent example ena lays off brent to ectric the only issue i see with this is offering the product when ena is closed as traders in london cannot act on behalf of ena or alternatively traders in houston could work extended hours russell do the hedge funds operate only out of new york or would they operate out of london or other european offices also i am just wondering how much of an issue the trading hours would be to clarify using ena as the contracting party for all global liquids products would risk exposing ena to a uk tax presence assuming that traders continue to be based in london since a significant proportion of enrons total income is earned by ena this would be an unacceptable risk any uk tax paid cannot offset the us tax liability because of certain limitations that apply to enron thus most of the uk tax paid represents

it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory sfa issues please comment also as a commercially efficient course of action it has always seemed to me that we should attempt to train our couterparties to accept that ectric is also a enron corp guaranteed sub at least it was in the past at their request and somehow initially set up our

novated from ectric to ena and treated as concluded under ena isda master three ena enters into backtoback trade with ectric this does mean that the cp must initially accept the european eol gtcs

lebrocq wendi sharma shifali subject fw trades as ena everyone our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing brent and other european product deals w our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ena the entity with which all the funds have isdas we just did two wtibrent crude oil spreads today one w very large volume and expect to be doing more such deals this is more than just a legal issue its going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on eol as well as we understand it the main legal issue is that all the funds have an isda only w ena and not w ectric so they and i assume we want all deals and legal exposure to be w ena to satisfy both parties desires all european product deals must be booked from ectric to ena sara from speaking to you and from justins response below it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we the funds and our traders might face is if no trader w ena in houston okays w the counterparty on enas behalf however there seem to be two other solutions a netting agreement and novating that get around this as sara knows dealing on legal agreements w the funds can be onerous and timeconsuming negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option from the credit side as we understand it the issue w not backtobacking the trades w ena is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds net position in houston and therefore not monitored in other words any exposure not sitting w ena will be invisible to credit so daily margining etc will be incorrect from the enrononline side as we see it there are a couple of issues eol wants the funds to trade online an increasing number of funds also want to trade online however they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only us based also they would like to see more arb spread products like a wtibrent crude oil spread online if neither desire can be easily met bc we need a separate isda w ectric which potentially means as above more onerous and timeconsuming negotiation then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now the point has been raised that the funds could trade european products if credit in london cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on eol we can assure you that they will not accept this these are the issues as we see them from the origination side there may be other issues that were missing from the sides that ive mentioned as well as the tradingback office side regards russ original

five july two zero zero one one nine two nine to beyhum maya boyd justin cc sharma shifali klar guenther sexton camille watt julie subject re trades as ena i assume that these are financial transactions the current approach is the right one in the circumstances ie trade between ectric and ena trade between ena and third party eg bank of america it is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ena is located in houston they cannot agree deals in the name of ena when located in london the pricing should be such that ena is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ectric to avoid booking the back to back trades a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ectric ena and bank of america if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position another alternative sometimes put forward is that ectric does the deal with bank of america the contract is then novated from ectric to ena and ena enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ectric note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through efet llc arranged by eeft instead of ectric effective one november regards janine original message from beyhum maya sent two five july two zero zero one one four one three to juggins janine boyd justin cc sharma shifali subject trades as ena hi i am currently working in the london risk group for global markets at the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ectric but would like to do deals only with ena eg bank of america as a result if a london trader wants to carry out a trade with bank of america he will do an internal trade with a trader in houston and then book a trade between the houston trader who trades under ena and bank of america the trades are then confirmed from the houston office we were wondering about a couple of things are

utilities sacramento governor gray davis today unveiled the framework of a recovery plan for the californias investorowned utilities that includes the purchase of their power lines and targeted revenue from the existing rate structure to help pay their back debt today we have begun serious negotiations with the utilities on a balanced recovery plan said governor davis this is a balanced business transaction it provides real benefits of real value to consumers and allows the utilities to get back on their feet elements of the plan include state purchase of the transmission grid owned by the states three investorowned utilities benefits to ratepayers and taxpayers including one a significant contribution by the parent companies to their utility subsidiaries to satisfy their creditors and return to financial viability two the extension of costbased rates from the utilities generating facilities from five to one zero years and a ban on their sale three conservation easements on utilityowned land in prime watershed areas and four dismissal of all pending litigation the governors plan directs the public utilities commission to establish a dedicated rate component from the existing rate structure not a new charge on consumer bills this would allow the utilities to make payments to their creditors including banks generators and renewable energy producers utilities would be allowed to sell revenue bonds secured by the dedicated rate component governor davis said he is working closely with the legislative leadership on legislative components necessary to carry out negotiations governor davis also noted that he sent a letter to president george w bush thanking him for his order today to expedite the review and licensing of new power generation facilities in california i am extremely gratified that president bush has acted to put the federal government on the same path as i have in california to cut red tape and get new power plants on line

blues divine is in sound financial shape filiposwki said in a press conference earlier today im comfortable leaving divine to fend for itself as i move on to greater opportunities when i came to the realization that divine and to a lesser extent chicagos internet presence could exist without my constant presence and supervision i began searching for another field i could put my stamp on and elevate filipowski decided his next venture would be in the field of music specifically the music of the blues filipowski formed a backup band the cronies consisting as is his custom of former platinum technologies employees i realized that divine was not sufficiently about promoting myself filipowski continued as such i consulted the reverend jesse jackson as rev jackson is the only person i could think of that might be qualified to advise me on selfpromotion eventually we determined much as rev jackson had become muchbeloved for reading doctor seuss on television that were i to record an album perhaps the general public could come to hold the sound of my voice in the same high esteem that i do filipowski says his decision to take up the blues was because of the musical genres strong association with chicago and underperforming record sales people say i dont know what the blues are about filipowski commented to me anything thats not performing up to its potential has the blues be it a company somebody who bothered to get an mba from harvard or even entire musical style from where im sitting the blues has the blues filipowski is on record as intending to singlehandedly save the chicago blues industry filipowskis signature tune i sold a company for two zero zero million and i cant get no respect appears to have a hit a popular chord with silicon valley executives

for the last five years our economy has been guided by a similar myth the myth that technology was and would drive our economy in the last one two months however those of us in the technology field have felt like our entire world has collapsed around us with layoffs closing of dot coms the nosedive of the nasdaq the disappearance of angel investors and the barricading of the doors to funding it seems like our entire world has fallen on dark times to our mind and the minds of all of the financial community the entire universe revolved around the failings of our technology sector and if so then the economy was surely doomed i being at the epicenter of technology for over five years tended to agree with these sentiments but miraculously something strange has happened in a strange twist of revelation people are beginning to point out that the universe indeed does not revolve around the planet of technology it instead revolves around the economy as a whole key planetary indicators like housing consumer spending large ticket items and automobiles are all holding strong indeed it is increasingly clear that technology was merely one planet in the entire economic universe and as we now know all planets revolve around the sun not around the earth the universal economy as a whole is more like our solar system and is made up of many factors all microcosms in and of themselves much like moons and asteroids revolving around a single planet but yet all truly still revolving around sol the core of our system so instead of a revolutionary idea driving our economy the economic philosophers of old are coming back into vogue as they have always said it was always about the sun technology is a part of our economic universe a planet perhaps maybe only a moon but certainly not

just seven percent say theyve lost money on a dotcomrelated investment only eight percent lost one of their favorite sites because of the dotcom downturn and while thestandardcoms layoff tracker has tallied nearly six five zero zero zero lost jobs among internetrelated businesses just nine percent of those surveyed by pew knew someone let go from an internet economy position more than twothirds of the respondents said they hadnt closely followed the dotcom devastation and one out of three said they didnt know anything about the cratering of the internet economy and this recently from crains in chicago despite economic slowing the chicago region added nearly five six zero zero zero jobs in the one two month period ended march two zero zero zero hitting a record total and the highest total employment in a decade how can that be the tech world is collapsing life will cease to exist the world will come to a stop this cant be everything revolves around my planet of technology no more likely we will look back on this collapse years from now and consider it nothing more than a celestial eclipse though we in the technology world feel like we are in a total eclipse of the sun the other planets economic indicators for those not following the astronomy analogy are in a partial eclipse if they are in one at all so think of the technology sector as being in a brief time when all in the world seems bathed in darkness but what was our light based upon tech values were nonsensible and out of line consumer spending was higher than cost of living increases a false sense of wealth and prosperity had set in two zero somethings were spending more cash in a year than they will ever see in their lifetime companies focused on hiring and expansion as opposed to prudent management of funds and the list goes on and on yes as we approached the eclipse we thought the sun revolved around our planet and as we were the center of the economic universe we felt we could do no wrong however the sun that great epicenter of the entire economy has cast a shadow on our lowly planet of technology thus reminding us once again that all is in order in the universe will the sun shine again of course it will will we be the center of the economic universe no and we should never expect to be no planet is ever thus so right now the ones panicking from an absence of sunlight are the youngsters who have never seen or experienced an eclipse before if you are still not following i am referring to an economic downturn a slow down a correction or at worst a recession yes if you talk to wise old sages those over three five who at least felt the pinch of the eight seven crash and those of the five zero s six zero s and seven zero s they will tell you it was always like this sometimes the sun shines on you and sometimes you are left in the dark with my brief history in technology sunshine and prosperity is all i have known but i should have known history doth have a way of repeating itself i often used to hear son you werent around when the bio techs were going crazy the reference being that all explosively absurd events go through a correction an eclipse if you will history is fraught with such examples biotech oil gold automobiles railroads gold again tulips and once even spices like pepper and cumin the list goes on what will the next planet be that thinks the sun doth revolve around it yes history doth have a way of repeating itself however in the long run no matter what planet you are on you will be in the light more often than the dark advert buy palm and handheld

clarification regarding qf contract amendments parties had requested clarification from cpuc decision based on language in admin law judge alj ruling that stated extensions could go forward until the commission acts cpuc states that parties remain free to negotiation changes but that they must move forward on ordinary review process this decision primarily undermines qf contract amendments with sces cpuc rejects pges call for market valuation of retained generation pge argued that cpuc must use market value of retained assets to set cost of service rates cpuc rejects argument duque will concur but notes that there are outstanding issues including the likelihood that cpuc will fail to meet statutory deadline to market value retained assets and fact that pge still has stranded cost
